Barca's Valverde skirts independence debate as Iniesta ruled out for Bilbao,"MADRID, (Reuters) - Barcelona boss Ernesto Valverde declined to be drawn on Friday on whether a declaration of independence by Catalonia s parliament meant his side might end up being kicked out of La Liga.     The Spanish football league s president Javier Tebas was previously quoted as saying that, should Catalonia become independent, the region s sides would not be able to compete in La Liga.  Valverde declined to comment on the possibility of that happening.      Nothing has happened (in relation to Barcelona not being in La Liga) and we re only talking about hypothetical situations,  he said.      I have my own opinion but I just want to concentrate on sporting questions, especially because the political situation appears to change every half hour.      In a bid to draw a line under Spain s worst political crisis in 40 years, the government in Madrid on Friday sacked Catalonia s regional government, dissolved the Catalan parliament and called a snap election in the region for Dec. 21. In what appears to be a doomed gesture, the parliament had hours earlier declared independence following a referendum on secession that Spanish courts had ruled was illegal. On the pitch, table-topping Barca confirmed that midfield playmaker Andres Iniesta would miss Saturday s visit to Athletic Bilbao.     The club captain, who this week was named in the FIFPro Team of the Year, has a thigh strain and adds to a growing list of absentees for Valverde that also includes Ousmane Dembele, Rafinha, Arda Turan, Aleix Vidal and Thomas Vermaelen.     The news is not all negative, however, with full back Jordi Alba given the green light by the club s medical staff to return to action.     Valverde joined Barca from Bilbao in the summer and will visit his former club as coach of the Catalans for the first time, insisting he will not allow emotion to get the better of him.      For me it s a special game. A lot of things link me to Athletic, but tomorrow I am the opponent,  he said. ",1.0
"Alleged Kenyan police killing of girl, baby in vote-related violence likely to reach court: official","NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s police monitor said on Monday investigations into the alleged killings by police of a girl and a baby in election-related violence were complete, and a spokesman said the case would probably end up in court. Kenyan police frequently face accusations of brutality and extrajudicial killings from civilians and rights groups, but officers are rarely charged and almost never convicted.  Human rights groups say at least 66 people have died in bloodshed associated with the August election, which was later voided by the Supreme Court, and in unrest surrounding the re-run of the presidential vote last month.  Stephanie Moraa, an 8-year-old girl in the Nairobi slum of Mathare, died after being hit by a stray bullet as police fired to disperse protesters on Aug. 12, the day after election results were announced. And the parents of six-month-old Samantha Pendo said she was teargassed and clubbed by police who invaded their home in Kisumu looking for protesters.  On Monday, the government-funded but civilian-run Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA) said it had forwarded its findings and recommendations to the director of public prosecutions  for review and direction . Asked on Monday what IPOA had recommended to the prosecutor s office regarding the two deaths, spokesman Dennis Oketch said:  It s a matter which will most likely end up in court. We don t want to give any information that can become prejudicial. We will wait for the [prosecutor s] review.  IPOA s statement did not specify if it had identified suspects in the two deaths. It did not mention any other investigations into election-related violence.  It has however, completed another investigation into alleged police beatings at a demonstration in September at Kenya s oldest university that sparked opposition anger at what they see as a pattern of police brutality.  IPOA said it had recommended to a police service commission that it take  stern disciplinary action against the responsible Commander . It had also forwarded the investigation file to the prosecutor s office, the statement read. Shortly after the August election, IPOA said it was fast-tracking investigations of all deaths and injuries for which the police were alleged by rights groups to be responsible.  Kenyan police dispute those accounts. The National Police Service described a report last month by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International on 33 deaths in Nairobi during the crackdown as  totally misleading and based on falsehoods . Despite its history of police brutality, Kenya is an economic and transport hub in East Africa and important Western ally against militant Islam that receives substantial financial support for its security services from international donors, including the United States and Britain. The IPOA was set up in 2011 after the killings of around 1,200 people in violence following the disputed 2007 election. It has received more than 9,000 complaints of police brutality and corruption since then.  Last year, it secured its first conviction, of two police officers sentenced for the death of a 14-year-old girl shot dead during a house raid in 2014. A survey last year by the non-profit International Police Science Association ranked Kenya s police force as the 125th worst-performing out of 127 national police forces studied. Only forces in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria did worse, measured on factors such as  process  and  legitimacy.  ",1.0

FBI WARNS Of Potential Terror Attack At SUPER BOWLWhite House Completely Silent,"Wouldn t it be great if the Obama administration came out with something regarding the terror risk revealed by the FBI?FBI officials sent out a memo warning of terrorist attacks at Super Bowl 50 that could take out the entire fiber-optics system that feeds the arena. If the fiber-optic cables get cut, it impacts financial institutions, impacts Silicon Valley,  said retired assistant Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey Harp, to KPIX 5.  It impacts a lot of infrastructure in that area. The FBI said it hadn t received a specific threat about the Super Bowl. But agents also said they ve identified several danger zones outside the stadium they re going to protect as well, CBS News reported. It s the lone wolf,  Harp said.  It s the individual who is self-radicalized that creates a problem that you can t detect. There s only so much the FBI can do with regard to surveillance within the guidelines of the Constitution. If someone were to use a drone to disperse something,  he said, CBS News reported,  it could be a potentially hazardous situation. Given that his beloved Chicago Bears were pretty much out of contention on the first week of the regular season, President Barack Obama hasn t really paid that much attention to the Super Bowl. That doesn t mean other people aren t, though   including the savages of the Islamic State group.An FBI bulletin claimed there was a significant threat to this year s Super Bowl 50   being held on Feb. 7 at Levi s Stadium in Santa Clara, California   from terrorist groups. There s going to be law enforcement secreted around the stadium that you are not going to see or know about. They are there,  retired FBI Assistant Special Agent In Charge Jeffrey Harp told reporters. If the fiber optic cables get cut, it impacts financial institutions, impacts Silicon Valley, it impacts a lot of infrastructure in that area,  Harp added.Several attacks have already been carried out against fiber optic systems in the Bay Area, disrupting Silicon Valley s extensive tech industry. None of those crimes have been solved.Via: WNDVia: Conservative Tribune",0.0
BREAKING: LOYAL TRUMP SUPPORTER Offered Attorney General Cabinet PositionHeres Why This Is A Great Choice,"Sen. Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, Donald Trump s friendly but fierce Alabama ally, has a message for Republicans still queasy about their party s nominee: Tide s about to roll over you. Sessions, a 69-year-old former state attorney general who famously donned the  Make America Great Again  trucker s cap at a massive rally in Mobile last August, thinks Trump is more a movement than a man. And this sprightly son of country preachers and teachers is on a mission to evangelize maybe-Trumpers like House Speaker Paul Ryan on the Gospel According to Donald   with a sermon on self-preservation. My advice is to listen and accept the will of the American people, the Republican voters   the Republican Party is the Republican voters,  he added   a pointed reference to Ryan s suggestion that he, and not the presumptive party nominee, represents authentic conservative values.

"Clinton criticizes Trump for remarks on security briefing, Putin","WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton slammed Republican rival Donald Trump on Thursday for talking about things he learned in classified intelligence briefings and for praising Russias Vladimir Putin as a better leader than President Barack Obama. Speaking to reporters the day after a New York security forum featuring separate appearances by the two candidates, Clinton also criticized the businessman for saying U.S. generals had been reduced to rubble by Obamas policies. At the televised forum on Wednesday night, Trump said he was shocked by information he got during the briefing. What I did learn is that our leadership, Barack Obama, did not follow what our experts ... said to do, Trump said. Clinton, who was secretary of state during Obamas first term, said Trumps comments on the briefing were totally inappropriate and undisciplined. I would never comment on any aspect of an intelligence briefing I received, Clinton said before boarding her campaign plane. As nominees for the Nov. 8 presidential election, she and Trump are entitled to receive intelligence briefings. Clinton said Trumps praise of Putin as a better leader than Obama was not just unpatriotic and insulting to the people of our country, as well as to our commander in chief, it is scary. It suggests he will let Putin do whatever Putin wants to do and then make excuses for him, Clinton said. Trump fired back at Clinton, saying her comments were an effort to make up for a poor performance during the security forum. Hillary Clinton is always complaining about whats wrong, he said during a campaign stop in Cleveland, where he visited a charter school and proposed federal spending on school choice programs.  I just watched her on the tarmac. She tried to make up for her horrible performance last night, Trump said. The intensifying political combat came as Clintons lead in opinion polls has slipped in recent days. The current average of polls by website RealClearPolitics puts her at 45.6 percent support, compared with Trumps 42.8 percent. Obama also hit back at Trump for criticizing his foreign policy record, saying the Republican nominee was unfit to follow him into the Oval Office and the public should press Trump on his outright wacky ideas. The televised Commander-in-Chief forum on Wednesday, attended by military veterans, was the first time Trump and Clinton had squared off on the same stage since accepting their parties White House nominations in July, although they did not appear at the same time. The forum offered a prelude to how Clinton and Trump will deal with questions of national security in their three upcoming presidential debates later in September and in October. Clinton has said her experience in government as secretary of state and a U.S. senator makes her uniquely qualified for the White House, and that Trumps series of controversial comments make him temperamentally unfit for the office. Some of Trumps foreign policy positions, such as his proposal to fight terrorism by imposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, have alarmed not just Democrats but many in his own partys leadership.  Trump, who has never held elected office, has criticized Clintons judgment for backing the 2003 Iraq war and her support for the U.S. intervention in Libya in 2011. The Republican candidate was widely criticized recently when he called her a co-founder, along with Obama, of the Islamic State militant group. Clinton, who voted in favor of the 2003 Iraq war as a senator but has since said she regrets doing so, said she would convene a meeting of bipartisan security experts on Friday to discuss the fight against Islamic State. What you didnt hear from Donald Trump last night was any plan to take on ISIS, Clinton told reporters, using an acronym for the group. Thats not only dangerous, it should be disqualifying. Trump and Clinton supporters went on the offensive on social media Wednesday night and Thursday morning, defending their candidates performances during the forum. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway spoke with Trump supporters in Congress on Thursday morning, and Trump spoke with the group by phone to thank them for their support. Some supporters shrugged off his comments about Putin. I think he is being very smart in how he addresses Putin and you know, maybe hes playing with Putins ego, said Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. Mike Pence, Trumps vice presidential running mate, told CNN it was inarguable that Putin had been a stronger leader of Russia than Obama had been in the United states. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the top elected Republican official, who has frequently broken with Trump, took a sharply different view. Putin is an aggressor that does not share our interests. Vladimir Putin is violating the sovereignty of neighboring countries, Ryan told reporters at his weekly news conference.     Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus told reporters at the Cleveland rally that Trump was not endorsing Putin with his praise. He doesnt agree with his style of government. He wasnt saying that, he said. Clinton said Republicans holding or seeking office across the country should be pressed on whether they agree with Trumps comments, including his views on Putin and U.S. generals that surfaced during the forum. Republicans are just in a terrible dilemma trying to support a totally unqualified nominee, I have no sympathy for them, its their nominee, she said. ",1.0
Trump administration does not want limits on war authorization,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps top national security aides pushed back on Monday against U.S. lawmakers calling for a new congressional war authorization, saying it would be a mistake to impose geographic or time limits on the campaign against Islamic State and other militant groups. War is fundamentally unpredictable, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis told a Senate hearing about a potential new authorization for the use of military force, or AUMF, Congress most significant step in years toward taking back control of its constitutional right to authorize war. Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson both told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee it would put U.S. forces at risk if existing authorizations were repealed without new ones in place. They said they do not need a new AUMF to justify ongoing military action. The 2001 AUMF provides statutory authority for ongoing U.S. military operations against al-Qaeda; the Taliban; and associated forces, including against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, Tillerson said. Republican and Democratic members of Congress have argued for years that Congress ceded too much authority over the military to the White House after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. But divisions over how much control they should exert over the Pentagon have stymied repeated efforts to pass a new AUMF. Republican Senator Jeff Flake, who proposed an authorization with Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, said Congress should buy in to military conflicts by exerting its constitutional authority to declare war. Here in the Senate, we aspire to be more than just a cog in a feedback loop, Flake said. He argued that passing an AUMF would send an important message that Washington is unified to U.S. troops, allies and adversaries. We have a job to do, Kaine said, questioning whether resistance to a new AUMF was simply opposition to congressional oversight. Concerns intensified this month after four U.S. soldiers were killed in Niger, and previously over Trumps talk about the possibility of an attack on North Korea and an April attack on an airfield in Syria. Republican Senator Bob Corker, the committees chairman, said the ambush in Niger shows U.S. forces can find themselves in combat at any moment. Congress has not passed an AUMF since the 2002 measure authorizing the Iraq War. But the legal justification for most military action for the past 16 years is the older authorization passed days after the Sept. 11 attacks, for the campaign against al Qaeda and affiliates. Backers of a new AUMF say the 2001 authorization has let presidents wage war wherever they like, without answering to Congress, or the public. For example, Islamic State did not exist in 2001. I do not think the American people want the United States conducting a global, endless Shadow War, under-the-radar, covert and beyond  scrutiny, said Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the foreign relations panel. Mattis said he was not averse to a new authorization. But he said imposing limits would help the non-state actors who are Americas adversaries in a non-traditional war spanning much of the globe.  If the enemy hopes we are going to quit on a certain day, or if they know we wont deal with them if they step over a certain border, then the enemy is going to do exactly that, Mattis said. Trumps fellow Republicans control majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives but there are deep divisions over any possible new authorization within the party, as well as between Republicans and Democrats. While some Republicans echo Flake in calling for Congress to weigh in, more hawkish lawmakers say military commanders should decide how to fight Americas enemies. Some Democrats say they want an AUMF limiting why, where and for how long U.S. forces can be sent to fight, but others refuse to go on the record supporting any conflict. ",1.0
France to skip 2018 Winter Games if security not assured,"PARIS/SEOUL (Reuters) - Frances Winter Olympics team will not travel to the 2018 Games in South Korea if its security cannot be guaranteed, Frances sports minister said on Thursday, the first major doubts by a participating nation about growing North Korean tensions. The games organizer said on Friday that it is closely monitoring the current geopolitical situation with the South Korean government, adding that safety is the top priority. Tensions in the region have escalated since North Korea conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test on Sept. 3, prompting global condemnation. North Koreas leader Kim Jong Un said on Friday the North will consider the highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history against the United States in response to U.S. President Donald Trumps threat to destroy the North. Frances Sports Minister Laura Flessel told RTL radio that if the crisis deepened and our security cannot be assured, the French Olympics team will stay at home.  But she added: Were not there yet. Participants in the Games - the first Winter Olympics hosted by an Asian nation outside Japan - had not previously raised safety concerns publicly. The games are scheduled for Feb 9-25 next year in Pyeongchang, just 80 km (50 miles) from the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, the worlds most heavily armed border. The two countries remain technically at war after their 1950-53 conflict ended with a truce and not a peace treaty. Safety and security is one of the most important aspects of Games preparations, Sung Baik-you, a spokesman for the organizing committee, said in a statement to Reuters on Friday. South Koreas President Moon Jae-in said on Wednesday the country is pushing to ensure security at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. In a meeting with International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach, Moon said South Korea is well aware of the concerns. The Japanese Olympic Committee said on Friday it is not considering the cancellation of its plans. We will continue to prepare in the same way as with other international competitions that we take part in, a spokeswoman for the committee said. The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) said it was working with all the relevant authorities to ensure its athletes would be safe. Each host city presents a unique challenge from a security perspective, and, as is always the case, we are working with the organizers, the U.S. State Department and the relevant law enforcement agencies to ensure that our athletes, and our entire delegation, are safe, USOC spokesman Patrick Sandusky said. The Chinese Olympic Committee said it had no immediate comment. The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC), which has representatives in South Korea, said the safety of its team was always its main priority. The safety of our entire Canadian Olympic Team is always our main priority, no matter where the Games are held, the COC said in a statement emailed to Reuters. The Government of Canada does not currently have travel advisories in place for South Korea and recommends that Canadians exercise normal security precautions, which is the lowest of four risk levels. Australia, one of Asias largest participants at recent Winter Games, is monitoring the situation. The safety of our team is of the highest priority but we are comfortable with the priority that the (International Olympic Committee) and the Org Comm are placing on security and safety of the Games and its participants, the Australian Olympic Committee said in a statement emailed to Reuters. We are relying on advice from DFAT (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade) and working with the Korean Ambassador and if their advice changes, we will advise our team accordingly but for the moment there is no suggestion that the Games will not go ahead or their safety is compromised. The chief of the International Ski Federation, Gian-Franco Kasper, dismissed any fears among athletes, saying the Pyeongchang Olympics would be the safest in the world. He conceded, however, that ticket sales among overseas visitors could be affected. The IOC has said it is not contemplating any Plan B for the Games.  IOC President Thomas Bach said last week that considering any scenario other than holding the Olympics in South Korea could hamper diplomatic efforts. ",1.0

Republican Representative Farenthold will not seek re-election,"AUSTIN, Texas/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Representative Blake Farenthold said he would not seek re-election in November, denying allegations of sexual harassment by former staffers but admitting he allowed an unprofessional culture to flourish in his Capitol Hill office. The 55-year-old congressman from Corpus Christi, Texas, made the announcement on Thursday, a week after the House Ethics Committee said it was investigating him over allegations of sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation involving a former female staff member. The committee said it was also looking into whether Farenthold had made inappropriate statements to other members of his staff. In a videotaped statement on his campaigns Facebook page, Farenthold said he was a political novice unprepared for his new responsibilities when he came to Washington for his first term in 2011. I had no idea how to run a congressional office, and as a result, I allowed a workplace culture to take root in my office that was too permissive and decidedly unprofessional, he said. Politico reported last week that the congressional Office of Compliance had paid $84,000 from a public fund on behalf of Farenthold for a sexual harassment claim. In 2014, his former communications director, Lauren Greene, filed a lawsuit accusing him of creating a hostile work environment, gender discrimination and retaliation, court documents showed. The two reached a confidential mediated agreement in 2015, according to a statement from Farentholds office that denied any wrongdoing by him. Reuters has been unable to verify the allegations against Farenthold, who said on Thursday that the charges were false.  This issue has become a political distraction, he said. Quite simply, my constituents deserve better. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan called the allegations disconcerting, including reports outlining unacceptable behaviors.  I think hes made the right decision to retire, Ryan said. Congress is reviewing its workplace policies on sexual harassment after a number of lawmakers have been accused of sexual misconduct in recent weeks amid a wave of such allegations against powerful men in entertainment, politics and the media.  Last week, Democratic Representative John Conyers and Republican Representative Trent Franks resigned, while Democratic Senator Al Franken said he would be stepping down in the coming weeks. ",1.0
 Romney Reminds America Why They Didnt Elect Him: Trumps Obama Birtherism No Big Deal (VIDEO),"Having been quiet since his presidential campaign went down in flames in 2012, Mitt Romney is suddenly back in the spotlight after forcefully condemning current Republican front-runner Donald Trump. But while it s great that Romney sees the inherent bigotry in Trump s message and wants to condemn it, there s just one problem: Romney loved Trump back when he was running for president.Or as Trump himself recently crudely put it: He was begging for my endorsement. I could have said,  Mitt, drop to your knees,  and he would have dropped to his knees. He was begging. True. He was begging me. In an interview with CNN s Gloria Borger, Romney was forced to defend his earlier opportunistic praise for Trump   and things quickly went off the rails.When Borger mentioned Trump s endorsement, Romney said at the time Trump didn t seem that bad. Like a good journalist, Borger didn t let him off the hook. Instead, she noted that there were already signs that Donald Trump was a world-class scumbag. After all, he was the  godfather of the Obama birther movement. Romney, in the sort of hypocrisy he became known for during his election campaign, managed to remind us why we didn t vote for him in the first place. Trump s birtherism wasn t a big deal, but attacking Megyn Kelly is.Well, no. I think that s a very different thing than calling Mexicans rapists, than saying that Muslims are not going to be allowed into the country as immigrants, than mocking a disabled reporter, going after women and saying oh, she asks tough questions because she was in her menstrual cycle is highly offensive. I said I disagreed with him. There are political views about one another where we re going to disagree, but what he has said during this campaign, that George W. Bush is a liar, that John McCain isn t a hero. I mean, he said some things that are completely, totally outrageous.So when he makes racist attacks against Obama during Romney s presidential campaign, Romney has no problem, but now that he is undermining the GOP s effort to appeal to minorities or calling George W. Bush a liar, suddenly Romney is feeling very sanctimonious.It was no secret that Mitt Romney spent much of his campaign publicly finger wagging at his voters for obsessing over Obama s birth certificate, while at the same time playing up the controversy at every opportunity. In August of 2012, Romney even took it a step further and stoked the flames himself with this appalling  joke. I love being home, in this place where Ann and I were raised. Where both of us were born No one s ever asked to see my birth certificate. They know that this is the place that we were born and raised. So when Romney says he disagrees with Trump  now  on the issues, it s only because four years ago, Trump s disgusting racism could be used as a means to an end   whip up the racists and get them to the polls. It s hard to imagine a person having less credibility on the issue of integrity than Mitt Romney.Watch the interview below via CNN (Birther comments begin around the 4:20 mark)Featured image via CNN",0.0
Just When Hillary Thought The News About Her Couldnt Get Any WorseThis Bombshell From Secret Service Agents Happens [Video],"How this woman is even trending in the polls should tell you everything you need to know about the Democrat party Good morning, ma am,  a member of the uniformed Secret Service once greeted Hillary Clinton. F  off,  she replied.That exchange is one among many that active and retired Secret Service agents shared with Ronald Kessler, author of  First Family Detail,  a compelling look at the intrepid personnel who shield America s presidents and their families   and those whom they guard.Kessler writes flatteringly and critically about people in both parties. Regarding the Clintons, Kessler presents Chelsea as a model protectee who respected and appreciated her agents. He describes Bill as a difficult chief executive, but an easygoing ex-president. And Kessler exposes Hillary as an epically abusive Arctic monster. When in public, Hillary smiles and acts graciously,  Kessler explains.  As soon as the cameras are gone, her angry personality, nastiness, and imperiousness become evident.  He adds:  Hillary Clinton can make Richard Nixon look like Mahatma Gandhi. Kessler was an investigative reporter with the Wall Street Journal and Washington Post and has penned 19 other books. Among much more in  First Family Detail,  he reports:  Hillary was very rude to agents, and she didn t appear to like law enforcement or the military,  former Secret Service agent Lloyd Bulman recalls.  She wouldn t go over and meet military people or police officers, as most protectees do. She was just really rude to almost everybody. She d act like she didn t want you around, like you were beneath her. Hillary didn t like the military aides wearing their uniforms around the White House,  one former agent remembers.  She asked if they would wear business suits instead. The uniform s a sign of pride, and they re proud to wear their uniform. I know that the military was actually really offended by it. Former agent Jeff Crane says,  Hillary would cuss at Secret Service drivers for going over bumps. Another former member of her detail recollects,  Hillary never talked to us . . . Most all members of first families would talk to us and smile. She never did that. We spent years with her,  yet another Secret Service agent notes.  She never said thank you. Within the White House, Hillary had a  standing rule that no one spoke to her when she was going from one location to another,  says former FBI agent Coy Copeland.  In fact, anyone who would see her coming would just step into the first available office.  One former Secret Service agent states,  If Hillary was walking down a hall, you were supposed to hide behind drapes used as partitions. Hillary one day ran into a White House electrician who was changing a lightbulb in the upstairs family quarters. She screamed at him, because she had demanded that all repairs be performed while the Clintons were outside the Executive Mansion. She caught the guy on a ladder doing the lightbulb,  says Franette McCulloch, who served at that time as assistant White House pastry chef.  He was a basket case. White House usher Christopher B. Emery unwisely called back Barbara Bush after she phoned him for computer troubleshooting. Emery helped the former first lady twice. Consequently, Kessler reports, Hillary sacked him. The father of four stayed jobless for a year.While running for US Senate, Hillary stopped at an upstate New York 4-H Club. As one Secret Service agent says, Hillary saw farmers and cows and then erupted.  She turned to a staffer and said,  What the f - - - did we come here for? There s no money here. Secret Service  agents consider being assigned to her detail a form of punishment,  Kessler concludes.  In fact, agents say being on Hillary Clinton s detail is the worst duty assignment in the Secret Service. Watch Hillary show her true colors when a reporter in Africa accidentally refers to Barack Obama as  Mr. Clinton.  Hillary doesn t forgive her faux pas and does her best to embarrass the reporter:After studying the Secret Service and its relationships with dozens of presidents, vice-presidents and their families, Ronald Kessler s astonishment at Hillary Clinton s inhumanity should reverberate in every American s head.As he told me:  No one would hire such a person to work at a McDonald s, and yet she is being considered for president of the United States.

U.S. voting commission vice chair urged new voting restrictions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The vice chairman of a voter fraud panel set up by U.S. President Donald Trump began soon after the election to draft legislative changes that would allow states to require voters to prove their citizenship when registering, court records show. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who has been on the panel since its creation in May, exchanged emails on the matter with Trumps transition team the day after the November presidential election, according to records unsealed by a federal judge on Thursday. Kobach, who like Trump is a Republican, was ordered to release the records as part of a legal challenge that has enjoined a state law that required Kansans to provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote. The records showed that by the day after the election, Kobach had already started drafting legislative changes that would permit all states to impose proof-of-citizenship requirements by amending the National Voter Registration Act, which lets Americans register to vote when they apply for drivers licenses. The records shed light on a photograph taken several days after the election that showed Kobach, then a contender for a Cabinet post, standing with Trump and holding a document partially obscured by his arm and titled Department of Homeland Security Kobach Strategic Plan for first 365 days. Kobach fought the public release of the documents, which included a heavily redacted version of the document in the photograph, for months in federal court.    He and his spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Any changes to the National Voter Registration Act, or motor-voter law, require congressional approval. Civil rights groups said they fear Kobach is using the Trump voting panel to drum up fake proof of widespread non-citizen voter fraud to persuade Congress to change the law. Trump has said without evidence that there was widespread voter fraud in the November election. Most state election officials and election law experts say U.S. voter fraud is rare. Requiring people to show birth certificates or other proof-of-citizenship when registering would be overly burdensome and would discourage young people, such as college students, said Dale Ho, director of the voting project at the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU sued Kobach over the Kansas law, which it said blocked more than 35,000 people, nearly 14 percent of new registered voters, from voting over two years. ",1.0
Former Border Patrol officials question Trump plan to add agents,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. Department of Homeland Security plan to add more than 5,000 border enforcement agents will present logistical challenges and might be unnecessary, according to former government officials familiar with earlier pushes to accelerate border hiring. Three former top officials at U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) told Reuters in interviews that ramping up hiring at the agency, as outlined in a directive on Tuesday, would beexpensive, while rapid expansion poses the risk of corruption if screening protocols for recruits are relaxed.  The officials said the agency should get what it needs to secure the border, but they questioned whether such a major staff expansion was necessary, noting that apprehensions at the border have dropped.  Congress is going to be looking at this very carefully and looking for justification for this kind of money to make sure they dont write a check that is not necessary, said W.Ralph BashamwhoheadedU.S. Customs and Border Protection during the George W. Bush administration. The question will be do we need more agents or do we need money for technology and infrastructure, he said.  Additional enforcement officers are central to President Donald Trumps sweeping plan to crack down on illegal immigration, outlined in Jan. 25 executive orders on border security and interior enforcement. Tuesdays Homeland Security guidance for implementing those orders called for adding more than 5,000 border patrol agentsand 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE,officers, who enforce immigration laws in the countrys interior, among other duties. The White House and Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a question about the rationale behind the number of personnel requested. At the end of the day, the goal is to get control of the border and enhance the security of the country, said White House assistant press secretary Michael Short in an email.  The proposed hiring surge would be the largest since the Bush administration, when Congress funded an expansion of border enforcement following the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks. That effort doubled the number of border patrol agents from nearly 10,000 in 2001 to nearly 20,000 by 2008, according to CBP. The agency was required to meet tight time requirements for hiring, said Bashamwhowas appointed commissioner in 2006 The laser focus on quick hiring, and its cost, ended up sucking all the air out of other parts of the department, Basham recalled, leaving gaps for other spending needs. Basham said he supports CBP getting adequate resources and was encouraged that the new Department of Homeland Security guidelines did not mandate a deadline to complete the hiring. But he questioned the need for a renewed expansion of the force. More than 1.6 million migrants were apprehended trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally in 2000 compared to 400,000 last year, according to CBP statistics. Currently the flow is not really anywhere near where it was, Basham said.  Jim Wong, who was Deputy Assistant Commissioner of CBPs Office of Internal Affairs from 2009 to 2011, said money might be better spent on other department needs.   Throwing more human resources at the issue is not necessarily the best way to approach it, he said.      The union representingborder patrolagents, which backed Trump in the presidentialelection, has long supported adding personnel, saying more manpower is needed to secure the border, said union spokesman Shawn Moran. Homeland Security spokespeople declined to estimate how much the increased hiring would cost. The 2017 fiscal year budget request for staffing at current levels of more than 21,000 border patrol agents was about $3.8 billion for salary, overtime and benefits,or about $180,000 per officer on average, although officers with different levels of seniority earn different wages. Additional costs could include housingfor agents workingin remote areas,equipment and support staff, former officials said. In the last budget cycle, the agency requested funding for 300 fewer officers than the year before to instead invest in replacing aging radios and vehicles. CBP said the request reflected realistic agent hiring expectations. Gil Kerlikowske, who headed CBP for three years under President Barack Obama, said one risk of rapid hiring is quality control. When you speed up the process and dont take the requisite time you pay a price later in things like corruption, Kerlikowske said. During the Bush-era hiring surge, the Border Patrol had problems screening candidates, and internal corruption cases soon spiked, according to congressional testimony and government documents. Congress then passed the Anti-Border Corruption Act in 2010, which made polygraph testing mandatory for all border patrol agents. Since then, tests have revealed candidates who were compromised by drug cartels or were heavy drug users themselves. But the polygraph test and other controls have also slowed the hiring process. A 2012 GAO report found that between 2008 and 2012, only 40 percent of applicants passed their polygraph exams. In addition to polygraph tests, applicants now undergo a rigorous hiring process, including a cognitive exam, fingerprinting, financial disclosure, fitness tests, medical examinations and background checks, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Kerlikowske said when he left the agency at the time of Trumps inauguration there were 1,200 authorized but unfilled openings for border patrol agents due to the difficulty of finding and vetting enough qualified candidates.

"Trump aides, lawmakers hold talks to revive healthcare bill","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top White House officials met moderate and conservative Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday in an effort to revive a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. Key members of the administration, including Vice President Mike Pence, invited a group of moderate Republicans known as the Tuesday Group to the White House. Pence then went to Capitol Hill to meet the Freedom Caucus, a group of House conservatives who last month derailed a healthcare bill backed by President Donald Trump. The White House would like to see a revised bill come up for a vote as early as weeks end, before the House breaks for a spring recess, and the text of the new proposal could be ready some time on Tuesday, lawmakers said. It was clear the president would be very happy come Friday to have this passed, said U.S. Representative Chris Collins, a member of the Tuesday Group and a Trump ally.  This could move fairly quickly, he said. Just 10 days ago, House Speaker Paul Ryan was forced to cancel a vote on a bill to replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, when it was clear he could not deliver the votes needed for it to pass. The defeat was a big political setback for Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress who were elected on pledges to repeal  and replace former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law. Freedom Caucus members said the Republican bill was too similar to Obamacare, while moderate Republicans balked at some of the changes conservatives sought. Trump attacked Freedom Caucus members on Twitter late last week for their opposition to the bill and threatened to work to defeat them in the 2018 congressional elections. At the weekend, he struck a more conciliatory tone, tweeting early on Sunday: Talks on Repealing and Replacing Obamacare are, and have been, going on, and will continue until such time as a deal is hopefully struck. After golfing with the president on Sunday, Republican Senator Rand Paul, a sharp critic of the Republicans previous healthcare bill, also expressed renewed hope the healthcare bill could be revised in a way that picked up support from the conservative and moderate factions of the Republican Party. Paul told reporters he was very optimistic that we are getting closer and closer to an agreement repealing Obamacare. Pence and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus laid out the administrations revised healthcare plan during a 40-minute meeting with Freedom Caucus members, said Congressman Mark Meadows, the leader of the conservative group. Meadows said he was intrigued by the new plan, which would allow states to opt out of some of Obamacares mandates, possibly by obtaining waivers. Were encouraged ... but would certainly need a whole lot more information before we can take any action either in support or in opposition, Meadows told reporters. He expected to see a detailed draft of the proposal within 24 hours, he said. In the earlier meeting with the moderate Tuesday Group, White House officials said the new plan would preserve Obamacares essential health benefits clause, or services and care that insurers must cover, but states could apply for a waiver if they could show it would improve coverage and reduce costs, according to Collins. Trump aides also discussed directing funds from the $115 billion stability fund for states into high-risk pools for people with pre-existing health conditions to better ensure insurance premiums come down in cost, Collins said. Its an acknowledgement that they were chasing votes with the Freedom Caucus and the Far Right and then ended up losing votes with those of us who are typically the most reliable votes, Collins said of the proposal provisions discussed at the meeting.

Neocon Nightmare: Trump Wants to Get Along With Foreign Countries,"21st Century Wire says Could this be the real reason why Trump is so despised by the elite Republican establishment?Watch a video of this report here:  Trump had this to say: Wouldn t it be nice if actually we could get along with Russia, that we could get along with foreign countries.  The neocon political faction that has dominated the Republican Party during recent history believes there is little to be gained from cooperation in politics, and prefers confrontation and domination instead; as they amply demonstrated with their 2003 Iraq War.For Donald Trump to be specifically saying that he wants to  get along with Russia  is unparalleled, as Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, said that Russia was without question our number one geopolitical foe .A world with an American President that wants  to get along  might certainly look a lot different to today s. Yet, as we are seeing, with the myriad of attacks against Trump, certain political and military industrial complex elite interests are not happy about the concept.Of course, we must remember that this is still just that   a concept. However good of a concept it is, Trump may very well not deliver this goal.Still, it certainly is a very different, and somewhat sweeter, change to the tune of American foreign policy rhetoric than we are used to hearing.Do you believe Trump has the right foreign policy stance, and will he implement it?GET THE FULL STORY ON ELECTION 2016: 21st Century Wire Election Files",0.0
Myanmar's Suu Kyi to visit China amid Western criticism over Rohingya exodus,"YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar s civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, will soon visit Beijing, state media said on Monday, as the southeast Asian nation appears to draw closer to its northern neighbor, China, amid global criticism over an exodus of Rohingya refugees. Myanmar has bristled at pressure from Western nations over its armed forces  brutal response to August attacks on security posts by Rohingya Muslim militants in the western state of Rakhine. The United States and the United Nations have accused Myanmar of  ethnic cleansing  and called for the military to be held accountable over allegations of killings, rape and arson that sent more than 620,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh. China, however, has backed what Myanmar officials call a legitimate counter-insurgency operation in Rakhine, and stepped in to prevent a resolution on the crisis at the U.N. Security Council. News of Suu Kyi s visit comes after Chinese President Xi Jinping and Chinese military leaders welcomed Myanmar s powerful army chief Min Aung Hlaing last week and pledged closer cooperation. The state-run daily Global New Light of Myanmar said Nobel Peace laureate Suu Kyi would  soon  depart to attend a Communist Party of China-hosted forum of world political leaders in Beijing.  Suu Kyi s spokesman Zaw Htay could not be reached for more details, but the meeting begins on Thursday and runs until Dec. 3, according to China s official news agency Xinhua.  Myanmar is in the international spotlight this week as Pope Francis makes the first visit by a head of the Roman Catholic church to the Buddhist-majority country. He has previously spoken out about the treatment of minority Muslims to whom Myanmar denies citizenship, but some Christians fear doing so in the country could provoke a backlash. Many in Myanmar refuse to recognize the name Rohingya, preferring to call them  Bengalis  to suggest they belong in neighboring Bangladesh. ",1.0

"Collapsing: Why the Russia Hack Witch Hunt Will Not End Well for Congress, or America","21st Century Wire says Washington s Russian witch hunt is now collapsing before our eyes. As host Patrick Henningsen revealed last Wednesday on ACR Radio, the supposedly damning information submitted by the FBI s private  cyber security  contractor Crowdstrike, of which the entire  Russian Hack  conspiracy theory hinges on   is fraudulent. Here is a link to their primary invented piece of  evidence  included in the US Intelligence Assessment. This means that we were correct back on Nov 1st when we said the Russian Hack story was a hoax designed distract from the explosive contents on the DNC and Podesta email leaks, and also to bolster a failing Hillary Clinton campaign by discrediting Donald Trump as being somehow in league with the evil Russians.If they keep pressing this story, it will only hurt the credibility of a Democratic Party that still refuses to admit the abject failures and corruption within of their political organization.Now the question remains: how more millions in US taxpayer money will Hollywood s Congressman Adam Schiff, and ringleaders Lindsey Graham waste before they re done trying to  look tough  on Russia and Trump? Will they be held accountable by anyone?In the end, we discover that Schiff, Feinstein, Graham, McCain and so many others in Washington have done extreme damage to American interests, and in the long run   to national security. Here s the story  US Congressman and NeoMcCarthyite Adam Schiff has himself become a ridiculous-looking caricature as of late. Justin Raimondo Antiwar.comThe allegation   now accepted as incontrovertible fact by the  mainstream  media   that the Russian intelligence services hacked the Democratic National Committee (and John Podesta s emails) in an effort to help Donald Trump get elected recently suffered a blow from which it may not recover.Crowdstrike is the cybersecurity company hired by the DNC to determine who hacked their accounts: it took them a single day to determine the identity of the culprits   it was, they said, two groups of hackers which they named  Fancy Bear  and  Cozy Bear,  affiliated respectively with the GRU, which is Russian military intelligence, and the FSB, the Russian security service.How did they know this?These alleged  hacker groups  are not associated with any known individuals in any way connected to Russian intelligence: instead, they are identified by the tools they use, the times they do their dirty work, the nature of the targets, and other characteristics based on the history of past intrusions.Yet as Jeffrey Carr and other cyberwarfare experts have pointed out, this methodology is fatally flawed.  It s important to know that the process of attributing an attack by a cybersecurity company has nothing to do with the scientific method,  writes Carr: Claims of attribution aren t testable or repeatable because the hypothesis is never proven right or wrong. Neither are claims of attribution admissible in any criminal case, so those who make the claim don t have to abide by any rules of evidence (i.e., hearsay, relevance, admissibility). Likening attribution claims of hacking incidents by cybersecurity companies to intelligence assessments, Carr notes that, unlike government agencies such the CIA, these companies are never held to account for their misses: When it comes to cybersecurity estimates of attribution, no one holds the company that makes the claim accountable because there s no way to prove whether the assignment of attribution is true or false unless (1) there is a criminal conviction, (2) the hacker is caught in the act, or (3) a government employee leaked the evidence. This lack of accountability may be changing, however, because Crowdstrike s case for attributing the hacking of the DNC to the Russians is falling apart at the seams like a cheap sweater.To begin with, Crowdstrike initially gauged its certainty as to the identity of the hackers with  medium confidence.  However, a later development, announced in late December and touted by the Washington Post, boosted this to  high confidence.  The reason for this newfound near-certainty was their discovery that  Fancy Bear  had also infected an application used by the Ukrainian military to target separatist artillery in the Ukrainian civil war. As the Post reported: While CrowdStrike, which was hired by the DNC to investigate the intrusions and whose findings are described in a new report, had always suspected that one of the two hacker groups that struck the DNC was the GRU, Russia s military intelligence agency, it had only medium confidence. Now, said CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch,  we have high confidence  it was a unit of the GRU. CrowdStrike had dubbed that unit  Fancy Bear. Crowdstrike published an analysis that claimed a malware program supposedly unique to Fancy Bear, X-Agent, had infected a Ukrainian targeting application and, using GPS to geo-locate Ukrainian positions, had turned the application against the Ukrainians, resulting in huge losses: Between July and August 2014, Russian-backed forces launched some of the most-decisive attacks against Ukrainian forces, resulting in significant loss of life, weaponry and territory. Ukrainian artillery forces have lost over 50% of their weapons in the two years of conflict and over 80% of D-30 howitzers, the highest percentage of loss of any other artillery pieces in Ukraine s arsenal. Alperovitch told the PBS News Hour that  Ukraine s artillery men were targeted by the same hackers, that we call Fancy Bear, that targeted DNC, but this time they were targeting cell phones to try to understand their location so that the Russian artillery forces can actually target them in the open battle. It was the same variant of the same malicious code that we had seen at the DNC. He told NBC News that this proved the DNC hacker  wasn t a 400-pound guy in his bed,  as Trump had opined during the first presidential debate   it was the Russians.The only problem with this analysis is that is wasn t true. It turns out that Crowdstrike s estimate of Ukrainian losses was based on a blog post by a pro-Russian blogger eager to tout Ukrainian losses: the Ukrainians denied it. Furthermore, the hacking attribution was based on the hackers  use of a malware program called X-Agent, supposedly unique to Fancy Bear. Since the target was the Ukrainian military, Crowdstrike extrapolated from this that the hackers were working for the Russians.All somewhat plausible, except for two things: To begin with, as Jeffrey Carr pointed out in December, and now others are beginning to realize, X-Agent isn t unique to Fancy Bear. Citing the findings of ESET, another cybersecurity company, he wrote: Unlike Crowdstrike, ESET doesn t assign APT28/Fancy Bear/Sednit to a Russian Intelligence Service or anyone else for a very simple reason. Once malware is deployed, it is no longer under the control of the hacker who deployed it or the developer who created it. It can be reverse-engineered, copied, modified, shared and redeployed again and again by anyone. In other words     malware deployed is malware enjoyed! In fact, the source code for X-Agent, which was used in the DNC, Bundestag, and TV5Monde attacks, was obtained by ESET as part of their investigation! During our investigations, we were able to retrieve the complete Xagent source code for the Linux operating system . If ESET could do it, so can others. It is both foolish and baseless to claim, as Crowdstrike does, that X-Agent is used solely by the Russian government when the source code is there for anyone to find and use at will. Secondly, the estimate Crowdstrike used to verify the Ukrainian losses was supposedly based on data from the respected International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). But now IISS is disavowing and debunking their claims: [T]he International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) told [Voice of America] that CrowdStrike erroneously used IISS data as proof of the intrusion. IISS disavowed any connection to the CrowdStrike report. Ukraine s Ministry of Defense also has claimed combat losses and hacking never happened . The CrowdStrike report uses our data, but the inferences and analysis drawn from that data belong solely to the report s authors,  the IISS said.  The inference they make that reductions in Ukrainian D-30 artillery holdings between 2013 and 2016 were primarily the result of combat losses is not a conclusion that we have ever suggested ourselves, nor one we believe to be accurate. One of the IISS researchers who produced the data said that while the think tank had dramatically lowered its estimates of Ukrainian artillery assets and howitzers in 2013, it did so as part of a  reassessment  and reallocation of units to airborne forces. No, we have never attributed this reduction to combat losses,  the IISS researcher said, explaining that most of the reallocation occurred prior to the two-year period that CrowdStrike cites in its report. The vast majority of the reduction actually occurs   before Crimea/Donbass,  he added, referring to the 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The definitive  evidence  cited by Alperovitch is now effectively debunked: indeed, it was debunked by Carr late last year, but that was ignored in the media s rush to  prove  the Russians hacked the DNC in order to further Trump s presidential ambitions. The exposure by the Voice of America of Crowdstrike s falsification of Ukrainian battlefield losses   the supposedly solid  proof  of attributing the hack to the GRU   is the final nail in Crowdstrike s coffin Continue this story at Antiwar.comREAD MORE RUSSIAN HACK NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Russian Hack FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE    SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER@ 21WIRE.TV ",0.0

 Ted Cruz Gets OWNED By Fox Host For Whining About Tough Questions (VIDEO),"Ted Cruz just got his ass handed to him by a Fox News host on national television for whining about hard questions.During an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Chris Wallace grilled the Texas Senator over the  dirty tricks  his campaign has perpetrated since the Iowa Primary in apparently desperate attempts to smear candidates and steak votes from them. Your campaign has been involved in a series of incidents that people are calling dirty tricks. In Iowa, the Cruz campaign sent out tweets saying Ben Carson was suspending his campaign. That was false. The campaign put out fliers accusing people of voting violations, that was false. In South Carolina, a Cruz super PAC attacked Trump over the Confederate flag. And your then-communications director posted a link this week accusing Rubio of disrespecting the Bible. That was false. Do you take personal responsibility   this was your campaign except for the super PAC   do you take personal responsibility for this series of incidents? And what does it say about the culture of the campaign you are running? Cruz not only failed to take personal responsibility for his campaign s actions, he called Wallace a liar and accused him of being a Donald Trump pawn. Every accusation you raised there is incorrect,  Cruz replied.  I appreciate your reading the Donald Trump attack file on that. And that did NOT sit well with Wallace at all, and he proceeded to take Cruz to the woodshed for it.WALLACE:  Oh, come on, sir. Wait a minute, sir. You personally apologized to Ben Carson on a debate stage. CRUZ:  Chris, don t interrupt me. WALLACE:  You fired your communications director. CRUZ:  Chris, don t interrupt me. WALLACE:  Don t say this in an oppo file on our part, sir. CRUZ:  Chris, please don t interrupt me. WALLACE:  Please don t accuse me of something I didn t do. CRUZ:  Let me know when I m allowed to answer. WALLACE:  Well, don t accuse me of doing something I didn t do. Two of those things, you apologized for one and you fired your communications director. Don t say this is the oppo file. After his ass-whooping by Wallace, Cruz went on to unbelievably claim that his campaign is running at the  highest level of integrity,  completely unfazed by the facts presented by Wallace to his face.Here s the video via YouTube.This is the perfect example of Ted Cruz saying and doing anything to be president. Rather than explain himself and accept personal responsibility, Cruz flat out lied to Wallace and pretended his campaign has never done anything wrong. And then he complained about the line of questioning and claimed they were part of a Donald Trump-approved attack line.Ted Cruz definitely could have handled this better, but now all he has is egg on his face.Featured image via video screen capture",0.0
Cambodia's Hun Sen urges arrests of opposition 'rebels in the city',"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia could make more arrests of people linked to a plot to overthrow the government, Prime Minister Hun Sen said on Monday, attacking opposition figures as  rebels in the city  bent on staging a  color revolution , despite past failures. The comment is part of the strongman s widening crackdown on opposition politicians and independent media that critics and rights groups see as an effort to shore up his party s strength ahead of a general election next year. Last month, authorities arrested Kem Sokha, leader of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), and charged him with treason and espionage over an alleged plot to take power with help from the United States. The U.S. embassy has rejected any suggestion of interference in politics. The Sept. 3 arrest sparked condemnation from Western countries, and the CNRP has said about half its members of parliament have fled Cambodia fearing a crackdown by Hun Sen.  This isn t over yet with one arrest, I would like to send out a message,  Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia for more than 30 years, said at an opening ceremony for a hotel in Siem Reap province.  This set-up is a systematic activity,  he added, referring to the alleged opposition plot to overthrow his government.  The rebels in the city that do  color revolution  are absolutely rejected.  Hun Sen can claim support from his main ally, China, which has said it supports Cambodia s efforts to maintain its security. The government says a 2013 video in which Kem Sokha tells supporters he has help from unidentified Americans to gain power is evidence that he was colluding with the United States. The opposition argues the video is evidence of an election strategy, not a coup plot. ",1.0
Rubio considers running for re-election to Senate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said on Wednesday he is  considering running for re-election and may decide to jump into the race as early as this weekend, a move that could help Republicans retain their majority in the U.S. Senate.  Ill go home later this week. And Ill have some time with my family. And then, if theres a change in our status, Ill be sure to let everyone know, the former Republican presidential candidate told reporters in the U.S. Capitol.  Rubio, 45, first elected to the Senate in 2010, announced his retirement from the Senate in March after losing Floridas presidential primary. But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and others have been pressuring him to reconsider, citing polling data showing him to be the only Republican who can win the election in Florida.  Rubio confirmed a Politico report that he was urged to run for re-election on Sunday in Orlando, Florida, by one of the Republicans contending for the seat, his friend Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez-Cantera. The two men were in Orlando after the shooting that killed 49 people at a gay nightclub. Another Florida Republican hopeful, U.S. Representative David Jolly, has indicated he would step aside if Rubio entered the race. Rubio must decide whether to seek re-election by June 24, the filing deadline for Floridas August primary. ",1.0

 Christian Dad Beat Daughter With Frozen Bacon While Quoting Bible  For Jesus,"It s always amazing how many folks who claim to be Christians are exactly nothing like Jesus. On Tuesday, an 11-year-old Michigan girl burst into tears intermittently as she testified in court that her father, 45-year-old Jonathan A. Powell,  beat her with frozen bacon as he quoted the Bible.In January, the girl and her sister went to stay with Powell at his home for the weekend when her father, for one reason or another, decided to dish out some good, old-fashioned Biblical punishment. He was hitting me with his elbows, his upper arms, and his hands,  the girl said while describing an assault that began in the kitchen, adding she didn t know why he had decided to beat her Her father pulled bacon from the freezer and began hitting her over the head with it: He was hitting me with frozen bacon and he was pushing me back and I fell right over the dishwater. I broke it. He was just yelling that the dishwasher was broken. The girl retreated to the bedroom, but the assault continued: I ran over to my room and my sister was asking me what was wrong. I was in my room for a while. I heard him swearing, saying,  You B-word, you broke my dishwasher.' Her father began banging on her door, the girl recalled as she burst into tears. She explained that Powell entered her room and pulled on the bed, causing her to hit her head on the wall. He then  threw a tantrum  and began hitting her with his hands and arms, bloodying her nose. This new assault, which lasted approximately 10 minutes, was justified with the Bible: He said,  It s OK to do that, it s from the Bible   if you spare the rod, you spoil the child.  He just said that. Or, in this case,  bacon  rather than  the rod. She says she then texted her mother and let her know she wanted to go home early, but Powell refused to take her home until she finally told her mother what had been done to her. The mother contacted the police, who took photographs that showed injuries to the side of her face.Powell is charged with one count of third-degree child abuse, for which he faces up to two years in prison   where he ll have plenty of time to pray about what he did.Featured image via Michigan Live",0.0
Kremlin says U.S. idea to cut all ties with N.Korea simplistic,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Thursday that the main question now is finding a solution to the North Korea crisis rather then cutting all ties with Pyongyang. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley on Wednesday called for other countries to sever all ties with Pyongyang, including cutting trade links and expelling North Korean workers.  Cutting all relations would be too simple,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters.  ",1.0
 Fox Host Gives Conservatives The Best Advice For How They Should Vote In November (VIDEO),"Conservative voters should definitely do this.A Fox News host finally came up with a good idea that would truly make America great again.During Fox and Friends on Tuesday, the show s newest host Ainsley Earhardt suggested that conservative  Christians  vote via prayer and let God decide who the next president will be.Religious nut Kirk Cameron s equally super religious sister Candace Cameron Bure joined the show as a guest and was asked her opinion on how to get Republicans to unite behind a single candidate.Current GOP frontrunner Donald Trump is in the middle of a fight with Ted Cruz over the Republican nomination which has split party extremists while alienating moderates. I don t know what it s going to take,  Bure said after conceding that she is NOT a political expert.  But I m an American and I hold conservative values, and I think at the end of the day, I realize I put my faith in Jesus Christ, not in any one person. Of course, Jesus is not a candidate for president but Bure promised to pray for whoever wins anyway. Whoever becomes our candidate, our nominee and eventually our president, I will pray for them and support that they make the best decisions for our country,  she continued.Earhardt, who replaced Elisabeth Hasselbeck on the panel when the latter stepped down in 2015, then suggested the idea that conservatives should just pray and let God decide who the nominee will be. As in, they should pray their votes into the ballot box and see if God counts them himself and whispers the name of the winner into the ear of the people who are supposed to count the votes. I know your faith is important to you as it is to many of us. Do you feel like in this election, we just pray about it and give it to God? And God s going to pick the right candidate? Bure balked at the suggestion and urged conservatives to physically vote at the ballot box for the candidate of their choice.Here s the video via YouTube.But Earhardt s idea should be given a fair chance by conservatives to work, especially if they really believe in the power of prayer and God s will. That s why they should sit at home on November 8th and just pray their vote to God by repeating the name of whichever Republican ends up on the ballot. Not only would conservatives be leaving the fate of the election in God s hands, they wouldn t have to stand in the incredibly long lines their Republican legislatures created by cutting voting hours and polling places.And when the Democrat wins, conservatives should concede that God has spoken and stop whining for at least the next four years while the chosen one does what is best for the American people   even if Republicans don t like it.Featured image via screenshot",0.0
A Trump loss would 'upset the verdict of history': Allan Lichtman," (Corrects this Oct. 5 storys headline to conform with quote from professor that a Trump defeat would upset the verdict of history.) (Reuters) - The forces influencing the U.S. presidential election favor Republican nominee Donald Trump to win the popular vote - but even proven prediction models face the most difficult election by far to predict accurately, a political forecaster with a three-decade winning streak said on Wednesday. History Professor Allan Lichtman of American University in Washington has accurately predicted the popular result in presidential elections since Republican President Ronald Reagan defeated Democratic challenger Walter Mondale in 1984. Although the number of ballots cast by voters for each candidate counts, it does not ultimately determine who takes the White House. In a process known as the Electoral College, the candidate who wins a majority of 538 electoral votes is the victor. Each state and the District of Columbia is allocated a certain number of those votes, and the candidates have to amass them state-by-state on Election Day. While Lichtmans Keys to the White House analysis predicts a popular victory by Trump, some other models, such as FiveThirtyEights and The New York Times, have given Democratic rival Hillary Clinton a large probability of victory. Lichtman joined Reuters Global Markets Forum to discuss his take on Campaign 2016. What follows are excerpts from that conversation. Question: Why is Trump your favorite to win? Answer: With respect to my prediction, my Keys system is based on 13 true/false questions where an answer of true favors re-election of the White House party - the Democrats. They have exactly six false keys against them, just enough to predict their defeat. However, I also noted that Donald Trump is such a dangerously precedent-breaking candidate that he could upset the verdict of history and snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The two candidates have been repeatedly fact-checked by independent sources, and his lies vastly outnumber hers. Q: How big is the immigration issue in deciding the election? A: I think immigration is a very important issue. America is a nation of immigrants and immigrants have been demeaned for more than two centuries, the French, the Irish, the Jews, the Asians, the Mexicans, and now the Muslims. The two candidates have fundamentally different approaches to dealing with the issue. Q: What is your expectation for the next two debates? A: Trump has got to convince voters that he has the temperament, knowledge, and background to be a dependable and effective leader. He can try to do that without losing his base, which will never abandon him. The first debate was definitely a lost opportunity (for Trump), which may be hard to regain for him. Obama lost the first debate (against Mitt Romney) in 2012, but voters still did not have as many doubts about him as they do about Trump. In terms of temperament, he could take a lesson from Pence, but Trump has a great deal of difficulty preparing for a debate or keeping himself under control. ",1.0
 CNN HAMMERS Kellyanne Conway For Lying About Them As Network Considers Permanent Ban,"Kellyanne Conway just got hammered with facts by CNN after she lied about why she wasn t on the network s Sunday shows.First, CNN rejected Kellyanne Conway for a day. Now the network is considering a permanent ban.The war between Donald Trump and CNN has escalated ever since inauguration day. Trump has repeatedly called CNN  fake news  and his adviser Kellyanne Conway has only parroted this attack every time she appears on any media outlet to whine about the way networks are reporting on the administration.It got to the point where Trump even froze CNN out by declaring that he would not send any more surrogates to appear on CNN shows. So when Trump offered to put Conway on CNN on Sunday, the network declined and got Mike Pence instead.Conway has repeatedly spread falsehoods and lies in defense of Trump and has attacked the media coverage every time she makes an appearance on television. She even admitted that Trump and his team lies by referring to those lies as  alternative facts,  a phrase she has been taking a lot of heat for since she uttered it.And her recent false story about a terrorist attack against Bowling Green, Kentucky that never happened has also earned her criticism from journalists. And that s why CNN booted her from their shows on Sunday.According to the New York Times,Some, like the New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen, were calling upon the television networks to stop booking her. And CNN declined to have her as a guest on Sunday   in part because the Trump administration offered her in lieu of Vice President Mike Pence, but also because of what the network told me were  serious questions about her credibility. So now CNN could be the first network to ban Kellyanne Conway from the airwaves. And that s a good thing because if she is incapable of doing anything but lying and spreading false information, she definitely should not be given a platform to mislead people. On any network for that matter.And their decision to ban her might pretty quickly since Conway just outright lied about why she wasn t on CNN on Sunday.Conway claimed that she wasn t rejected by CNN and that she wasn t on the shows because she had family commitments. She then proceeded to claim that she is scheduled to appear on CNN on Monday and Tuesday.CNN quickly responded.. @KellyannePolls was offered to SOTU on Sunday by the White House. We passed. Those are the facts.  CNN Communications (@CNNPR) February 6, 2017Other media outlets should follow CNN s lead. Journalistic integrity and ethics demand that Conway be removed before she does more damage. Her misinformation and propaganda campaign may be tolerated by Fox, but it should not be tolerated by real news outlets.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",0.0
Trump staff writer takes responsibility for Melania speech controversy,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - A staff writer of the Trump Organization, the company owned by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, has claimed responsibility for inserting passages in a speech given at the Republican National Convention by Trumps wife Melania that resembled parts of a 2008 speech by first lady Michelle Obama. The woman, Meredith McIver, released a statement on Wednesday apologizing for using the language, which she said Melania Trump recited to her in a phone call, without checking to see how closely it matched Obamas speech at the Democratic National Convention eight years ago.

U.S. investigates reports of civilian casualties in Afghanistan,"KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan and U.S. military authorities are investigating reports that as many as 13 civilians were killed in an operation in the northern region of Kunduz, officials said on Monday, but details remain sketchy three days after the incident. There were conflicting reports of the casualty numbers in Friday s incident in the district of Chahardara outside Kunduz. A local council member said 13 people were killed, but a spokesman for the provincial governor said it was just one. However, the incident underlines the risk of increased civilian casualties from the recent U.S. decision to step up air strikes and special forces operations in Afghanistan to break a stalemate with Taliban militants.  There is a need for a proper investigation to prove these allegations and we will launch it soon,  Ghulam Qader Akbari, the governor of Chahardara, said on Monday. On Saturday, the NATO-led Resolute Support mission in Kabul confirmed the incident had occurred in Kunduz and said an investigation had begun, but gave no details.  We are aware of allegations regarding the potential for civilian casualties as the result of a combined operation in northern Afghanistan,  Resolute Support spokesman Capt Tom Gresback said in a statement.  Resolute Support takes all allegations of civilian casualties and the responsibility of human life seriously, and is assessing the facts surrounding this incident.  Khosh Bawar Nasratyar, a member of the local provincial council, said 13 people had been killed by U.S. airstrikes in the district. But Nematullah Temor, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said only one civilian had been killed and six wounded when coalition forces hit a car taking people to the villages of Ghar O Qeshlaq and Qatl-e-Am to evacuate Taliban casualties. He said other reports of civilian casualties were  untrue and baseless . Afghan Special Forces said 48 insurgents had been killed in Chahardara but denied any civilian casualties, saying the area had been evacuated before the operation. But graphic pictures purporting to show the aftermath of the incident, and unconfirmed reports that as many as 60 people had been killed, were widely shared on social media, highlighting the risk that public opinion could turn decisively against the government over the issue. The most recent United Nations civilian casualty figures, released last month, show air strikes drove a rise of 52 percent in the first nine months of 2017, to 205 killed and 261 injured, versus the corresponding period last year. Former President Hamid Karzai, who clashed bitterly with the United States over civilian casualties when he was in power, condemned the incident, but there was no comment from the government of President Ashraf Ghani.

BREAKING: OFF-DUTY POLICE OFFICER Suspended For Driving By BUTT-HURT TRUMP-HATERS With Confederate Flag On Truck," The flag ruffled an otherwise-peaceful event Friday, when hundreds of locals descended upon the Open Space for the  Love Trumps Hate  rally. Marshall Collins Jr., of Traverse City, raised a fist in the air as the truck circled the event.Collins, who is black, later confronted the white man who drove the truck, parked it in a restricted zone and sipped a Bud Light while a crowd grew around the vehicle. He said the man denied the flag s history is steeped in racism and division. It means a lot to people like me,  Collins said.  It means hatred. A photograph from the incident circulated on social media following the confrontation. Police Chief Jeff O Brien on Saturday confirmed the man depicted was Officer Michael Peters, a 18-year veteran with the department. He said a sergeant will conduct an internal investigation starting Monday. That s not what the Traverse City Police Department represents,  O Brien said.  We are to provide protection for everybody. The Confederate flag is not something we consider an oath of office. We take an oath of office to the Constitution, not the Confederacy. I personally feel that flag stands for hate and hatred. Peters couldn t be reached for comment.A woman arrived with Peters. Another man   Ryan Salisbury, a former Grand Traverse County sheriff s deputy   held an anti-Hillary Clinton sign nearby. Local businessman Andy McFarlane, who confronted the trio along with Collins, said he attended the rally because he felt Trump used racist and sexist rhetoric.The Confederate flag only supports bigoted stances, he said. The reason I have such a powerful reaction is it s a symbol for the denial of those rights for a portion of the population,  McFarlane said.Collins grew up splitting his time between Northport and Florida. He said the flag-emblazoned trucks like Peters  were a frightening sight from his days in the South. Those vehicles forced Collins and his sister into bushes and under beds for fear of prowling Ku Klux Klan members.He spoke about those experiences to a crowd of rallygoers. (Peters) had the nerve to tell me that I had no experience with the flag,  Collins said.Salisbury denied he saw Peters or participated in a protest with him, although the two parked next to each other and could be seen together. He said he arrived to stand up for a fair election and because he felt it insenstive to hold such a rally on Veterans Day. I think that as a Americans we have a right to demonstrate peacefully,  he said.Salisbury said the Confederate flag is not a symbol of racism.Peters stayed for about 10 minutes before they finished their beers and drove off. Rumors circulated among protesters that Peters was a local law enforcement officer, but Collins didn t know for sure until Saturday.Collins said he didn t feel safe knowing someone who is supposed to protect his rights would fly that flag. He said O Brien s condemnation  hit the nail on the head. I hope they hold (Peters) accountable,  he said.  He needs to be held accountable. O Brien said his officers have a constitutional right to free speech, but also a code of conduct and other internal policies. He said a sergeant on Monday will look into whether Peters violated those rules, as well as local prohibitions on where people can openly drink alcohol. We ll do an internal investigation and see if any policy was violated,  he said.Traverse City police officials recently shifted toward a community policing model in which officers are encouraged to develop local ties to the community. O Brien said Peters  apparent behavior didn t represent the department. We re trying harder to build relationships in the community,  O Brien said.Via: Record Eagle",0.0
U.S. considering wider Iran threat as part of its policy on nuclear deal: Tillerson,"LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. government is continuing to develop its policy on Iran and will consider the wider threat it poses beyond its nuclear capabilities, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Thursday. In April, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a review of whether a suspension of sanctions on Iran related to a 2015 nuclear deal, negotiated under President Barack Obama, was in the U.S. national security interest. He has called it  the worst deal ever negotiated.  The Trump administration is continuing to review and develop its policy on Iran ... no decision has been made,  Tillerson said during a news conference in London following a meeting with British foreign minister Boris Johnson.  President Trump has made it clear ... we must take in to account the totality of Iranian threats, not just Iran s nuclear capabilities, that is just one piece of our posture towards Iran.  Tillerson also said Iran was clearly in default of the expectations of the 2015 deal.         ",1.0
DIRTY POOL! FBI AND DOJ Just Affirmed They Spied On Trump WITHOUT Proving Dossiers Authenticity,"How dirty is this? The powers-that-be at the intelligence agencies didn t follow the proper channels before opening up spying on the Trump campaign! They needed proof that the Trump dossier is authentic but never received that proof. They moved forward with the spying anyway! What dirty rats these Democrats are!FBI and Justice Department officials have told congressional investigators in recent days that they have not been able to verify or corroborate the substantive allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign outlined in the Trump dossier.The FBI received the first installment of the dossier in July 2016. It received later installments as they were written at the height of the presidential campaign, which means the bureau has had more than a year to investigate the allegations in the document.The dossier was financed by the Hillary Clinton campaign and compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.An August 24, 2017 subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee to the FBI and Justice Department asked for information on the bureau s efforts to validate the dossier. Specifically, the subpoena demanded  any documents, if they exist, that memorialize DOJ and/or FBI efforts to corroborate, validate, or evaluate information provided by Mr. Steele and/or sub-sources and/or contained in the  Trump Dossier. According to sources familiar with the matter, neither the FBI nor the Justice Department has provided documents in response to that part of the committee s subpoena. But in face-to-face briefings with congressional staff, according to those sources, FBI and DOJ officials have said they cannot verify the dossier s charges of a conspiracy between the Russian government and the Trump campaign.Read more: WE",0.0
Saudi Arabia to let women enter sports stadiums in 2018,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will for the first time allow women to attend sports events, preparing special sections in three selected stadiums from early next year in another step toward opening public spaces to women. The stadiums in Jeddah, Dammam and Riyadh will be set up to accommodate families from early 2018, said the statement from the General Sports Authority, carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency late on Sunday. Last month Saudi Arabia announced that, from June, women would be allowed to drive cars, ending the world s only ban on female driving. An economic and social reform program led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman aims to open up cloistered lifestyles, shaped in part by a strict, conservative version of Sunni Islam that limits the role of women. Prince Mohammed also seeks to diversify the economy away from oil as part of his proposed reforms. The crown prince will be the first Saudi leader since 1953 to hail from a new generation when he inherits the throne; his father Salman is the sixth brother in a row to serve as king. The kingdom adheres to an austere Wahhabi brand of Sunni Islam, which bans gender mixing, concerts and cinemas. Women are required to receive permission from a male guardian to obtain passports or leave the country. Some of the social aspects of the reforms have been criticised by some clerics and Saudis on social media. Saudi authorities are also starting to reform areas once the exclusive domain of the clergy, such as education, courts and the law, and have promoted elements of national identity that have no religious component or pre-date Islam. Prince Mohammed told businessmen and reporters at a major investment forum last week that the country would cleave to a more open and tolerant interpretation of Islam. ",1.0
Putin-linked think tank drew up plan to sway 2016 US election - documents,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Russian government think tank controlled by Vladimir Putin developed a plan to swing the 2016 U.S. presidential election to Donald Trump and undermine voters faith in the American electoral system, three current and four former U.S. officials told Reuters. They described two confidential documents from the think tank as providing the framework and rationale for what U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded was an intensive effort by Russia to interfere with the Nov. 8 election. U.S. intelligence officials acquired the documents, which were prepared by the Moscow-based Russian Institute for Strategic Studies [en.riss.ru/], after the election. The institute is run by retired senior Russian foreign intelligence officials appointed by Putins office.  The first Russian institute document was a strategy paper written last June that circulated at the highest levels of the Russian government but was not addressed to any specific individuals. It recommended the Kremlin launch a propaganda campaign on social media and Russian state-backed global news outlets to encourage U.S. voters to elect a president who would take a softer line toward Russia than the administration of then-President Barack Obama, the seven officials said.  A secondinstitute document, drafted in October and distributed in the same way, warned that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was likely to win the election. For that reason, it argued, it was better for Russia to end its pro-Trump propaganda and instead intensify its messaging about voter fraud to undermine the U.S. electoral systems legitimacy and damage Clintons reputation in an effort to undermine her presidency, the seven officials said. The current and former U.S. officials spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the Russian documents classified status. They declined to discuss how the United States obtained them. U.S. intelligence agencies also declined to comment on them. Putin has denied interfering in the U.S. election. Putins spokesman and the Russian institute did not respond to requests for comment.  The documents were central to the Obama administrations conclusion that Russia mounted a fake news campaign and launched cyber attacks against Democratic Party groups and Clintons campaign, the current and former officials said. Putin had the objective in mind all along, and he asked the institute to draw him a road map, said one of the sources, a former senior U.S. intelligence official.  Trump has said Russias activities had no impact on the outcome of the race. Ongoing congressional and FBI investigations into Russian interference have so far produced no public evidence that Trump associates colluded with the Russian effort to change the outcome of the election. Four of the officials said the approach outlined in the June strategy paper was a broadening of an effort the Putin administration launched in March 2016. That month the Kremlin instructed state-backed media outlets, including international platforms Russia Today and Sputnik news agency, to start producing positive reports on Trumps quest for the U.S. presidency, the officials said.  Russia Today did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Sputnik dismissed the assertions by the U.S. officialsthat it participated in a Kremlin campaign as an absolute pack of lies. And by the way, its not the first pack of lies were hearing from sources in U.S. official circles, the spokesperson said in an email. PRO-KREMLIN BLOGGERS Russia Today and Sputnik published anti-Clinton stories while pro-Kremlin bloggers prepared a Twitter campaign calling into question the fairness of an anticipated Clinton victory, according to a report by U.S. intelligence agencies on Russian interference in the election made public in January. [bit.ly/2kMiKSA] Russia Todays most popular Clinton video - How 100% of the 2015 Clintons charity went to ... themselves - accumulated 9 millions views on social media, according to the January report. [bit.ly/2os8wIt] The report said Russia Today and Sputnik consistently cast president elect-Trump as the target of unfair coverage from traditional media outlets.  The report said the agencies did not assess whether Moscows effort had swung the outcome of the race in Trumps favor, because American intelligence agencies do not analyze U.S. political processes or U.S. public opinion. [bit.ly/2kMiKSA] Neither of the Russian institute documents mentioned the release of hacked Democratic Party emails to interfere with the U.S. election, according to four of the officials. The officials said the hacking was a covert intelligence operation run separately out of the Kremlin. The overt propaganda and covert hacking efforts reinforced each other, according to the officials. Both Russia Today and Sputnik heavily promoted the release of the hacked Democratic Party emails, which often contained embarrassing details. Five of the U.S. officials described the institute as the Kremlins in-house foreign policy think tank.  The institutes director when the documents were written, Leonid Reshetnikov, rose to the rank of lieutenant general during a 33-year-career in Russias foreign intelligence service, according to the institutes website [bit.ly/2oVhiCF]. After Reshetnikov retired from the institute in January, Putin named as his replacement Mikhail Fradkov. The institute says he served as the director of Russias foreign intelligence service from 2007 to 2016. [bit.ly/2os4tvz] Reuters was unable to determine if either man was directly involved in the drafting of the documents. Reshetnikovs office referred questions to the Russian institute.  On its website, the Russian institute describes itself as providing expert appraisals, recommendations, and analytical materials to the Russian presidents office, cabinet, National Security Council, ministries and parliament. [bit.ly/2pCBGpR]  On Jan. 31, the websites of Putins office [bit.ly/2os9wMr] and the institute [bit.ly/2oLn9Kd] posted a picture and transcript of Reshetnikov and his successor Fradkov meeting with Putin in the Kremlin. Putin thanked Reshetnikov for his service and told Fradkov he wanted the institute to provide objective information and analysis. We did our best fornearly eight years toimplement your foreign policy concept, Reshetnikov told Putin. Thepolicy ofRussia andthepolicy ofthePresident ofRussia have been thecornerstone ofour operation. ",1.0
"Britain's ""Madame Brexit"" tells Poland: Your constitution is your own matter","WARSAW (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May gave Poland a rare dose of big power support on Thursday by saying that its constitution was its own affair, a sharply different tone to that of the European Union which has scolded Warsaw over judicial reforms. The EU executive launched an unprecedented action against Poland on Wednesday, calling on other EU member states to prepare to sanction Warsaw if it fails to reverse judicial reforms that Brussels says pose a threat to democracy. When asked about the Commission s move to deploy the  nuclear option  under Article 7 of the 2009 Lisbon treaty, May said:  These constitutional issues are normally, and should be primarily a matter for the individual country concerned.  Speaking alongside Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in Warsaw, May said:  Across Europe we have collective belief in the rule of law.    I welcome the fact that Prime Minister Morawiecki has indicated that he will be speaking with the European Commission and I hope that that will lead to a satisfactory resolution.  While the EU executive has censured Polish ruling party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski s push to have control of judicial appointments, May is seeking to court Poland as an ally in Brexit negotiations and key military partner against Russia. Poland has said reforms are necessary while like-minded allies in Hungary have indicated they will veto the ultimate sanction of suspending Poland s voting rights in the bloc. At one point, a translator s slip made Morawiecki appear to cast May as  Madame Brexit , though in fact he said in Polish:  as Madame PM said, Brexit is Brexit . May said Britain and Poland had signed a defense and security cooperation treaty which deepens cooperation on training, information sharing and capability development. On the eve of a visit by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to Moscow, May said Vladimir Putin s Kremlin was trying to weaponise information and undermine a rules-based international system.  We are both deeply concerned by Russia s attempts to weaponise information,  she told reporters.  The Kremlin is seeking to undermine the international rules-based system and it will not succeed.  Morawiecki said he hoped France and Germany were aiming to work out the best solution with Britain as it leaves the EU  I have deep hopes and conviction that our French and German partners aim to work out the best solution in this new, not easy situation that we are in with respect to Brexit,  Morawiecki said.

"Turkey, Russia will meet to finalize S-400 defense deal in coming week","ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish and Russian officials will meet to finalize Turkey s S-400 surface-to-air missile systems deal in the coming week, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday. Turkey has been negotiating with Russia to buy the system for more than a year. Washington and some of its NATO allies see the decision as a snub because the weapons cannot be integrated into the alliance s defenses. Turkey expects to receive its first such system in 2019, defense Minister Nurettin Canikli said in November adding that the deal includes two S-400 systems while one was optional.  Our officials will come together in the coming week to finalize the S-400 issue,  Erdogan said during a joint news conference with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. Turkey has been working to develop its own defense systems and equipment and has lined up several projects for the coming years including combat helicopters, tanks, drones and more. Erdogan also said Ankara and Moscow were on the same page regarding the U.S. move on Jerusalem and added that two leaders would keep in contact on the issue. ",1.0
EPA Jails 185 Americans For Environmental Crimes But No One For Massive EPA Toxic Spill,"Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) enforcers helped convict 185 Americans of environmental crimes this year, with each of these eco-convicts getting sentenced to eight months in prison on average for crimes ranging from biofuel fraud to illegally removing asbestos. Every year, EPA agents help put dozens of Americans in prison for breaking U.S. environmental laws. Environmental crimes range from spilling coal ash into public waterways, to pretending to produce biofuels, to illegally cleaning up asbestos in buildings.Interestingly enough, EPA has not fined or jailed anyone for the spilling of three million gallons of mine wastewater in August. That month, EPA workers opened up the Gold King Mine and sent a toxic plume of mine waste though rivers in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. Toxic mine waste even went through Navajo Nation territory and resulted in farms having their water supplies shut off.Republican lawmakers were quick to criticize EPA for not taking any disciplinary action against contractors or employees involved in the Colorado mine spill. Lawmakers noted that while EPA drags its feet, a private company, like Duke, would have been fined quickly if it had spilled mine waste.The Department of the Interior s outside review of the spill incident found EPA could have avoided a blowout if it had taken precautions agency workers had used while opening other sealed Colorado mines.Interior found that had the agency used  a drill rig to bore into the mine from above  to open Gold King  the mine would have been revised, and the blowout would not have occurred. The EPA has taken responsibility for the spill, but still hasn t taken actions against agency workers who opened up the mine mouth. In fact, lawmakers are worried the agency is trying to taint a federal investigation into the spill.Read more: Daily Caller",0.0
 Trump Fan Violently Attacks Comedian For Harmless Joke (VIDEO),"Comedian John Caparulo was in the middle of a perfectly normal standup act at The Comedy & Magic Club in Hermosa Beach, California when someone was apparently too stupid to get his joke about Donald Trump and reacted violently.

Some people think it looks like a dick but I think they re saving that design for Trump s monument.  Though the majority of the audience laughed uproariously, two women decided that Mr. Caparulo was a goddamn traitor. Fuck you,  one of the women yelled, apparently unable to summon enough of her insignificant brainpower to form a snappy comeback. No fuck you stupid, what are you his fucking mom? Get the fuck out of here,  Caparulo replied, seeminly bemused by this woman s shock that someone doesn t like the least popular president in American history.  Oh god, am I the first one to dislike Trump? Oh my god, I must ve invented disliking Trump  Fucking break up my show lady, you can come up here and do this shit. Go fuck yourself,  the woman screamed as she threw her glass at Caprulo   a sure sign that it s probably a bad idea to give these people alcohol that isn t in a sippy cup. The glass shattered when it hit the comedian. That hurt a little bit,  he said, laughing.  I ll have to admit that hurt. Thank you, she was a bitch all night,  one audience member yelled as the Trump fan left. Others agreed with her.  Fuck you,  one yelled.  Fuck Trump,  another added.Unfortunately, this is the mindset of Trump fans. Everything they don t like is met with violence because, at least according to studies, Trump fans are too stupid to know they are stupid. They lash out. They threaten. They scream. They throw fits. In many ways, they are just like their tangerine fuhrer.Watch the events unfold below:",0.0
 Golden State Warriors Coach Just WRECKED Trump After Attack On One Of His Players,"On Saturday, the man we re forced to call  President  Trump responded to Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry s refusal to accept an invitation to the White House by doing the internet equivalent of incoherently screeching  WELL FINE,  YOU RE NOT INVITED ANYWAY. Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitating,therefore invitation is withdrawn!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017Unfortunately for Trump, Warriors coach Steve Kerr has Curry s back. The idea of civil discourse with a guy who is tweeting and demeaning people and saying the things he s saying is sort of far-fetched,  Kerr said on Sunday.  Can you picture us really having a civil discourse with him? It was an actual chance to talk to the president,  he said.  After all, he works for us. He s a public servant. He may not be aware of that, but he is a public servant, right? So maybe as NBA champions, as people in a prominent position, we could go in and say,  This is what s bothering us, what can we do about this?'  Then he laid in to Trump for attacking black football players for exercising their First Amendment rights while calling Nazis  very fine people: How about the irony of  Free speech is fine if you re a neo-Nazi chanting hate slogans, but free speech is not allowed to kneel in protest?  No matter how many times a football player says,  I honor our military, but I m protesting police brutality and racial inequality,  it doesn t matter. Nationalists are saying,  You re disrespecting our flag.  Well, you know what else is disrespectful to our flag? Racism. And one s way worse than the other.

 OOPS: Trump Just Accidentally Confirmed He Leaked Israeli Intelligence To Russia (VIDEO),"On Monday, Donald Trump once again embarrassed himself and his country by accidentally revealing the source of the extremely classified information he leaked to Russia earlier this month.While it was speculated that the source of the information was Israel, Trump made things crystal clear during a press conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

"Organizers of white nationalist rally in Virginia, driver sued for $3 million","CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (Reuters) - Two people who say they were injured in a far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia sued the man charged with killing a woman by driving his car through the crowd as well as the events organizers on Tuesday for $3 million. Tadrint Washington and Micah Washington said in papers filed in Charlottesville circuit court that they had been among the people hurt when James Alex Fields drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one. They had been driving home and their car was struck by Fields car, and some of his pedestrian victims were also hurled onto their vehicle, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit names Fields, Unite the Right rally organizer Jason Kessler and about two dozen alt-right leaders and organizations as defendants. There was no doubt that violence was intended at this rally, the pair said in the lawsuit, noting that participants came bearing shields and weapons. Kessler has denied that the event was intended to provoke violence, contending that the counter-protesters sparked the fighting and blaming police for failing to protect his group. He could not be reached for comment on Tuesday. Fields has been charged with second-degree murder for killing Heather Heyer with his car, and additional charges for the other 19 people injured. He was denied bail at a Monday court hearing. ",1.0
 Right-Wing Mom Beats Her Kids To A Bloody Pulp To Lead Them To God (VIDEO),"The right-wing mom who forced her children to sing songs to the Bundy terrorists after they seized a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon experienced a revolt of her own when her children took away her guns and fled the house in search of help from law enforcement.The five kids escaped the home because they wanted the beatings they constantly endured to end.Authorities arrested Odalis Sharp on Friday for beating the children bloody with a rod in the name of God in what she called her way of leading them to Christianity. We need to turn to God, because the system is corrupt,  Sharp said before accusing the government of waging a vendetta against her.  They lie, they twist, they make false charges, they abuse people, and then they turn around and put people in prison, and then they accuse them of abuse. But it isn t the government accusing Sharp of abuse, it s her own children.They testified on Wednesday that their mother mercilessly abused them most days of the week by calling them names, forcing them to eat soap, and beating them bloody with a belt or rod as well as slapping them and hitting them in their private parts. They said it s typical to always receive some type of bruising and other times have bled from the swats,  a social worker told the court.  The children told me they were fearful. They did not want to return to their mother. The sheriff also described how one child told him that one of spankings  consisted of 47 swats,  and that after 27 spankings the abused child began bleeding. Sharp s 15-year-old son fled the home to escape constant beatings as well and Sharp explained it by saying the boy rejected  the right, wholesome and pure path in which I was leading him   in which God was leading us. And the kids don t have to go back to their mother either because the judge removed the children from Sharp s custody and placed them in the custody of the Kansas Department of Children and Families.Here s the video of Sharp s rant via YouTube.This is yet another case of how conservatives twist and use religion to excuse horrible acts. This woman dragged her kids to the center of a standoff between the FBI and a bunch of gun-toting right-wing terrorists and that s on top of the constant beatings they suffered at the hands of their mother who actually thinks she is doing God s work by bloodying up her kids.That probably makes televangelist Pat Robertson smile, but is hardly an acceptable way to treat children in modern society. If you have to resort to beating religion into kids, your religion is truly weak.Featured image via screenshot",0.0
CAN WE ADD DIRTY MONEY LAUNDERING To The Obama $1.7 Billion Iran Ransom Payment?,"A member of the House Intelligence Committee is accusing the Obama administration of laundering some $1.7 billion in U.S. taxpayer dollars to Iran through a complicated network that included the New York Federal Reserve and several European banks, according to conversations with sources and new information obtained by the lawmaker and viewed by the Washington Free BeaconNew disclosures made by the Treasury Department to Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.), a House Intelligence Committee member, show that an initial $400 million cash payment to Iran was wired to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) and then converted from U.S. dollars into Swiss francs and moved to an account at the Swiss National Bank, according to a copy of communication obtained exclusively by the Free Beacon.Once the money was transferred to the Swiss Bank, the  FRBNY withdrew the funds from its account as Swiss franc banknotes and the U.S. Government physically transported them to Geneva  before personally overseeing the handover to an agent of Iran s central bank, according to the documents. It looks as if the White House made just about every corner of the executive branch complicit in covering up the extent of its payments to Iran,  the source said.  Congress was already aggressively looking into payments involving the State, Treasury, and Energy Departments. Now it s the Justice Department, too. We already know that top officials from Justice objected strongly to the ransom deal, but were overruled. Congress wants to know what happened and why. Read more: WFB",0.0

"More Americans think wealthy, not middle class, will benefit from tax reform: Reuters/Ipsos","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans are more likely to believe the wealthy will benefit most from the tax reform currently being pushed in the U.S. Congress by Republicans who insist their goal is to help the middle class, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Thursday.  The poll found 32 percent of Americans think the wealthy will benefit most, compared to 14 percent who think all Americans will benefit and 14 percent who think large U.S. corporations will benefit most.  Congress is working to try to enact the most sweeping overhaul of the tax code since the 1980s that would lower taxes for millions of individual tax payers and slash the rate paid by corporations. The proposal would also eliminate most individual tax deductions, a move that could result in some taxpayers seeing an increase in their total bill to the government while others see a decrease. Despite an insistence by Republicans that their goal is help the middle class, only 8 percent of Americans think that demographic will benefit the most, the poll, which was conducted Nov. 3-8, found.  Republicans and Democrats are divided on who they think tax reform would help the most. Among Republicans, 26 percent think all Americans will benefit, followed by 16 percent who think the wealthy will benefit most, the poll found.  But among Democrats, 46 percent think that wealthy will benefit most, with only 7 percent thinking all Americans will benefit and 17 percent who think corporations will benefit. And while those polled did not think that the middle class will benefit most, an overwhelming majority thought that they should.  The poll found 79 percent think its more important to cut taxes for the middle class than for corporations, and 76 percent think its more important to cut taxes for the poor than for corporations.  However, 76 percent said it was more important to cut taxes for corporations than it was to cut taxes for the wealthy. When it comes to specific changes, the poll found that 46 percent of Americans oppose limiting the mortgage interest deduction, compared to 35 percent who support the change.  The strongest opposition came to the Republican proposal to eliminate deductions for medical expenses, with 54 percent saying they are against the change and 32 percent saying they support it.     The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted in early November online in English throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,608 adults and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points. ",1.0

 Was Martin Luther King Jr. A Republican? The Truth Will Make Conservatives Freak Out,"Conservatives and Republicans love to claim that Martin Luther King, Jr. is one of their own. They claim that the legendary clergyman and civil rights icon was a Republican, and sometimes even claim that he was a conservative.This is a lie.Dr. King had harsh words for both parties:Actually, the Negro has been betrayed by both the Republican and the Democratic party. The Democrats have betrayed him by capitulating to the whims and caprices of the Southern Dixiecrats. The Republicans have betrayed him by capitulating to the blatant hypocrisy of reactionary right wing northern Republicans. And this coalition of southern Dixiecrats and right wing reactionary northern Republicans defeats every bill and every move towards liberal legislation in the area of civil rights.  [The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr: Symbol of the Movement, January 1957   December 1958. University of California Press. p. 84]But he said in an October 1956 letter to a civil rights supporter that he had  always voted the Democratic ticket. And in his autobiography, Dr. King said he voted for John F. Kennedy in 1960 because he  felt that Kennedy would make the best president.  He also wrote that  had President Kennedy lived, I would probably have endorsed him in 1964. As far as the Republican Party, Dr. King specifically attacked them for their hard turn to the right in 1964 with the nomination of conservative Barry Goldwater. King said that the party had begun pandering to racist elements, and as a result, he could not support Goldwater in the election versus sitting President Lyndon Johnson:The Republican Party geared its appeal and program to racism, reaction, and extremism. All people of goodwill viewed with alarm and concern the frenzied wedding at the Cow Palace of the KKK with the radical right. While not himself a racist, Mr. Goldwater articulated a philosophy which gave aid and comfort to the racist. His candidacy and philosophy would serve as an umbrella under which extremists of all stripes would stand. In the light of these facts and because of my love for America, I had no alternative but to urge every Negro and white person of goodwill to vote against Mr. Goldwater and to withdraw support from any Republican candidate that did not publicly disassociate himself from Senator Goldwater and his philosophy. [The Autobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr.]Similarly, the right s claim that Dr. King was a conservative is laughable. King was well to the left of even the Democratic Party, and opposed the party on key issues like the Vietnam War, to which King objected. King was also a big supporter of an increased minimum wage as well was worker s rights like unionization. Does that sound like a conservative?Martin Luther King Jr. was one of the most effective and dynamic leaders in American history. He was not a Republican, supported Democratic presidential candidates, and was a strong liberal on a host of key issues. Too often King is depicted as sort of a black Santa Claus, devoid of politics and ideology. But that isn t the true King. He was a man of the left, and he succeeded because of that political leaning combined with his faith and the hard work of millions committed to progress.Featured image via Wikimedia",0.0
TIFFANY & CO. TAKES BIG RISKSides AGAINST Trump On Very Controversial Issue,"Who knew? Tiffany & Co. just decided to show its hand when it comes to politics. We re not happy to tell you that the luxury retail jeweler just bought into the global warming scam hook, line and sinker The American jeweler is asking the president to keep the U.S. in the Paris Climate Agreement.The American jeweler took to social media to send a message to president Donald Trump. Dear President Trump,  read the Instagram and Twitter posts.  We re still in for bold climate action. Please keep the U.S. in the Paris Climate Agreement. The disaster of climate change is too real, and the threat to our planet and to our children is too great. The move comes on the same day that the president postponed his decision on whether or not to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, reports CNN. The goal of the agreement is to create  a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2 C,  according to European Commission s website.Trump intended on making an announcement before attending the Group of Seven nations summit in Sicily, Italy, on May 26-27, but now, he s going to make a decision after the G7, explained White House press secretary Sean Spicer.Trump has a long history with Tiffany & Co; he named his youngest daughter after the iconic jeweler and the brand s flagship store is connected to Trump Tower in New York. Following the election, sales at the flagship store tumbled 14 percent in November and December, compared with the same period last year. Tiffany & Co. even canceled its holiday window unveiling event due to post-election protests around the area.Read more: Hollywood ReporterWhat they re not telling you is this  agreement  is a HUGE redistribution of American tax dollars to other countries! So if we are to address the Climate crisis we need to challenge the structural causes of the crisis which lies on unequal distribution of wealth, of carbon, and of power. Whether it s political power, economic power, or even military power.  -Camille Risler For many years the public at large has been spoonfed the idea that Global Warming Climate Change, is caused by man s excessive release of carbon into the atmosphere. And that the solution to the Climate crisis was to decrease the production of said gas.Over the past several years the Global Warming fanatics have changed their tune. Many of us in the  new  media have been warning about their true motives for year.Now, instead of the climate crisis being caused by carbon emissions, it is being caused by inequality.On Monday, during a press conference at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris, Ms. Camille Risler, a representative of the Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development (APWLD) which is an organization listed as an official consultant to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, stated that the cause of Climate Change is the unequal distribution of wealth, carbon, and power: This is the press conference of the Women and constituency. It is one of the nine official constituencies of the UNFCCC, and we are composed of 15 women s rights and feminist organizations from all around the world. So I m going to begin with kind of an overview of our positions and then I will give the floor over to my colleagues that will go more into details of each section of negotiations.I m Camille Risler. I m from France but I m living in Thailand. I m working for a feminist network that is called Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development and I m working for the Climate Justice Program.So what we want to highlight here is that Climate Change is a clear symptom of an unequal and unjust world.

"Countering anti-Trump protests, president's fans stage rallies","ATLANTA (Reuters) - Supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump rallied in communities across the country on Monday, partly as a rebuttal to anti-Trump protests that have taken place since his election in November. Trump was not scheduled to appear at any of this weeks events, which were taking place at venues ranging from a park in the small town of Gravette, Arkansas, to the plaza outside the Georgia State Capitol building in downtown Atlanta. I just think we need to support our president, said Vivian Phillips, a 60-year-old retired schoolteacher who drove more than seven hours from her West Virginia home to Atlanta, where about 200 people gathered on an overcast day.  Phillips held a sign reading adorable deplorable from West Virginia, referring to a disparaging comment made by Democrat Hillary Clinton during the campaign about Trump supporters. In Denver, about 150 people met on the steps of the state capitol to voice their support for the president, sing patriotic songs and listen to speakers. Many waved American flags, and some held signs bearing Trumps campaign theme: Make America Great Again. One woman held a sign with a photograph of Hillary Clinton and the words: Get Over It. Im here to let the president know hes not alone although it seems like that at times, said Karen Eitzel, 56, a Denver Republican who was accompanied by her husband, Jack, a 62-year-old retired utility worker. In Brea, California, in traditionally conservative Orange County, about 60 people stood outside a shopping mall chanting Build the wall and God bless America, God bless Donald Trump and carrying sings that read Trump loves you and Trump all the way. Demonstrators marched wearing red hats with signs that read Donald Trump 45h President, and carrying flags and banners, some reading Make America Great Again. Passing motorists honked and cheered in support.  In Mandeville, Louisiana, outside New Orleans, almost 100 people, many dressed in the red, white and blue colors of the American flag, gathered at a pavilion to voice their support. The crowd, which included a Trump impersonator, carried signs such as We Love Trump and Support Our President. Some of the rally organizers came out of the Tea Party movement, a large, informal network of anti-establishment conservatives that has become an increasingly powerful force in Republican politics since its beginnings in 2009.  A group called Main Street Patriots said it helped organize so-called Spirit of America rallies in at least 33 of the 50 states, both on Monday and Saturday. Most of the rallies are scheduled for Saturday, when larger crowds are expected. Raucous rallies, often filling sports arenas, became a hallmark of Trumps presidential campaign, in contrast with lower-key events staged by Clinton. Earlier this month, Trump rekindled that energy for the first time since his election in a freewheeling rally in Melbourne, Florida.  But Trumps crowds have rarely regrouped since Novembers election, while large protests by people who oppose Trumps policies, particularly his crackdown on immigration, have become more frequent.

Pentagon delivers draft plan to defeat Islamic State to White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Pentagon-led preliminary plan to defeat Islamic State was delivered to the White House on Monday and U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was expected to brief senior administration officials, a Defense Department spokesman told reporters. Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis told reporters that it was the framework for a broader plan and looked at Islamic State around the world, not just Iraq and Syria. Davis said the plan would define what defeating Islamic State meant and was one that would rapidly defeat the militant group.  He added that Mattis would discuss the plan, which is primarily a written one with accompanying graphics, with members of the Cabinet-level Principals Committee. The review of U.S. strategy comes at a decisive moment in the U.S.-led coalition effort against Islamic State in both Iraq and Syria, and could lead to relaxing some of the former Obama administrations policy restrictions, like limits on troop numbers. The Trump administration has said defeating radical Islamic terror groups is among its top foreign policy goals. The Baghdad-based U.S. commander on the ground, Army Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend, has said he believes U.S.-backed forces would recapture both of Islamic States major strongholds - the cities of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria - within the next six months. Iraqi forces expect a fierce battle against Islamic State to retake Mosul. In Syria, the United States must soon decide whether to arm Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters, despite objections from NATO ally Turkey, which brands the militia group as terrorists. The U.S. military-led review includes input from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, as well as from the Treasury Department and the U.S. intelligence community. Davis said that in addition to diplomacy, the plan would include a military framework that builds on capabilities and goals on the battlefield. Experts have said the Pentagon could request additional forces, beyond the less than 6,000 American troops now deployed to both Iraq and Syria, helping the U.S. military go farther and do more in the fight. They also said the Pentagon may focus on smaller-scale options like increasing the number of attack helicopters and air strikes as well as bringing in more artillery. The military may also seek more authority to make battlefield decisions. ",1.0
Leading U.S. senator urges changes in foreign investment rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Republican senator leading the charge on updating little-known investment rules designed to protect national security said that he will soon introduce a bill aimed at reining in potentially dangerous deals done by China. Senator John Cornyn, a member of the Republican leadership who is on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told the Council on Foreign Relations on Thursday that he was concerned by Chinas attempts to ensure that its military catches up to the U.S. Defense Department in terms of technology. China is using every tool at its disposal to close the technology gap between the United States and that country, and in the process, to eliminate our militarys technological advantage, he said in his speech. Cornyns office provided Reuters with a copy of the address on Monday. To combat this, Cornyn plans to introduce a bill in Congress that would update the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, an interagency panel led by the Treasury Department that reviews proposed transactions to ensure they do not pose a challenge to national security. The law firm Covington and Burling LLP, which follows CFIUS, said in a note after the speech that it believed that Cornyns proposed legislation may ultimately become law. Senator Cornyn is among the most influential members of the Senate, and there appears to be an emerging bipartisan consensus that CFIUS should be strengthened, the firm said in an analysis on Friday. Cornyn said the legislation would be called the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, and would ensure that CFIUS focuses its investigations on countries which pose the biggest threat to the United States. It would also give CFIUS the authority to look at a broader range of deals, including joint ventures based outside the United States and smaller, minority-position investments which would give the investing companies access to sensitive information, Cornyn said. Cornyns office did not respond to a query on Monday regarding when the bill would be introduced. CFIUS already has a reputation for being tough on high-tech deals, and has been known in particular to block transactions that involve sophisticated semiconductors. The bill will not expand the committee, which will disappoint those who had pushed for the Agriculture Department to become a member of the panel. ",1.0
" Joy Behar HUMILIATES Trump For Flynn Resignation, Says What Were ALL Thinking (VIDEO)","Donald Trump and his incompetent, corrupt team got their a**es handed to them today on The View, following the massive controversy surrounding the resignation of General Mike Flynn from his role as National Security Advisor last night.This was a topic that co-host Joy Behar could not wait to get into, as she ripped into Trump and sarcastically said what most of us have been thinking about the Flynn situation: I thought he knew more than the generals! He knows everything else, right? Exactly. Trump spend his entire presidential campaign acting like he knew more than everyone else, and even remarked that he knew  more than the generals  do about ISIS. Now more than ever, Trump has proven that his statements were complete lies   and this fiasco with General Flynn exposes it perfectly. If Trump had known everything, he would have known that Flynn was speaking with Russian officials and that Flynn had lied to VP Mike Pence about his communications with Russia.Behar was hardly the only host on The View who wanted to say something about it   co-hosts Jedediah Bila and Whoopi Goldberg jumped at the chance to weigh in. Bila slammed Trump and his team for being so reckless with their appointments and for dropping the ball. She said: There s no way that he didn t know about it. Everyone went and said,  Look, this could potentially compromise our national security because this guy may potentially get bribed.  Then what happens? Kellyanne Conway has the responsibility to be informed. This is falling on the heels of her having that huge controversy promoting Ivanka [Trump] s line and now she s out there talking about,  I didn t know.  No, it s your job to know and it s Donald Trump s job to know. If there is someone in your administration that could potentially jeopardize our national security, that becomes our problem and it s your job to protect us. That s your one job!

What about his admission in January 2017, that he was the one who passed along the dossier of claims of a Russian blackmail plot against the president-elect? McCain called it doing  what any citizen should do .McCain   a longstanding anti-Trump Republican who had disassociated himself from the candidate s campaign weeks before the election   cast himself as an innocent and concerned member of the public as he justified his move.He claimed he had no idea whether it was accurate or not   but that he believed the FBI should have it because it was  sensitive . I did what any citizen should do. I received sensitive information and handed it to the FBI,  he told CNN   the network which broke the story that the document existed. It was then published in full by Buzzfeed. The Arizona senator issued a public statement amid mounting questions of his exact role in the affair   and how a document riddled with errors and unverifiable claims came to be published. Late last year, I received sensitive information that has since been made public,  he said. Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the Director of the FBI. That has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue. But the 2008 Republican loser, who disowned his party s candidate weeks before the election, may have been far more intimately involved than that.  Daily MailThe Clinton campaign and the DNC, through the law firm, continued to fund Fusion GPS s research through the end of October 2016, days before Election Day.The  Russian dossier,  whose contents Trump has denied and which has been widely discredited, is believed to have led the FBI to investigate the Trump campaign and several Trump associates.Until now, Fusion GPS has continued to refuse to cooperate with congressional panels investigating Russian attempts to intervene in the election, and how the Obama administration probed those efforts. Democrats have also protected the company.The revelation that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee were involved in procuring the salacious accusations against Trump that fed their own later accusations of Russian interference in the election lends credence to those who, like Trump himself, have regarded the Russia accusations as conspiracy theories.

"BLACK LIVES MATTER ACTIVIST, Erica Garner Makes Campaign Ad For SANDERS [VIDEO]OOPS! Bernies Support For INSANE TAXES Killed Her Dad","TAXES really do kill people. Eric Garner is a perfect example. This tragedy happened on Donald Trump s home turf, if his campaign was on top of their game, they d be all over this Ahead of the Pennsylvania primary Bernie Sanders was asked about Philadelphia s proposed soda tax during a recent interview with  Meet The Press . Hillary Clinton favors the tax but Bernie opposes it because he says it taxes the poor who are already struggling enough. Chuck Todd didn t buy that answer and pressed Sanders to explain why he opposes the soda tax but favors cigarette taxes (which are much, much higher). Bernie explained that he thinks  cigarettes are different than soda  and that  there s almost a question as to why [cigarettes]remain a legal product in this country . Apparently, Bernie Sanders doesn t realize that the cigarette taxes he favors are what got Eric Garner killed.Unfortunately, Chuck Todd didn t catch that statement and moved on to other topics. He should have jumped on it given that it s quite the hypocritical line coming from someone trying to gain the support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Bernie Sanders even has the support of Eric Garner s own daughter who starred in a three minute campaign ad just a couple months previous.One wonders whether or not Erica Garner approves of Bernie Sanders  support of the cigarette taxes that killed her father.Recall that Eric Garner was accused of selling un-taxed cigarettes in New York City. The Federal government already imposes a $1.01 tax, which the New York state government adds a $4.35 tax to, and the New York City government tacked another $1.50 onto. That brings the total cigarette tax in New York City to more than $6.85 cents which is more than the cost of the cigarettes themselves. These excessively high taxes that Bernie Sanders supports double the price of pack of cigarettes and creates a black market for un-taxed cigarettes.It was this black market that Eric Garner was accused of taking part in. Un-taxed cigarettes are a lucrative business in New York City and account for tens of millions of dollars in sales. Many people try to make a living selling these un-taxed cigarettes as Eric Garner was allegedly doing when he was stopped by the police.Situations like this are the inevitable result of high taxes. If people refuse to pay taxes this is how they will be enforced. People with guns will show up. People will die.Via: A Libertarian Future ",0.0
Trump picks Giuliani to assemble cyber security meetings with executives,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump plans to meet with corporate executives who have faced cyber security challenges in a series of meetings arranged by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, his transition team said in a statement.

Instead, the statement said, Trump aims to obtain experiential and anecdotal information from each executive. ",1.0
Cheesy puns abound as White House hosts online chat,"(Reuters) - The White House attracted pungent waggery on Wednesday after using the arcane theme of a big block of cheese to lure people into a post-State of the Union online conversation with administration officials.  The social media event was inspired by President Andrew Jacksons 1837 open house featuring a 1,400-pound block of cheese, with a meta allusion to fictional White House chief of staff, Leo McGarry, who told his staffers about the cheese draw in an early episode of The West Wing TV series. Following President Barack Obamas final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, the administration invited Cabinet officials, members of Congress and Senior White House officials to answer questions submitted by the public on social media such as Twitter and Facebook, with the hashtag #BigBlockOfCheeseDay. It was the third year the White House has staged the event and it was among the top trending hashtags on Twitter on Wednesday as people asked questions on topics ranging from climate change to the economy.  Others jumped in to deliver a gouda deal of cheese puns. Margarey Gach (@mgachby) tweeted: Seeing the White House accounts inundated w/ cheesy puns is really grate. They feta keep this up all day #BigBlockOfCheeseDay. #BigBlockofCheeseDay you cheddar believe it, wrote Darren Bown (Dazzb84). Pure bliss with a slice of swiss #BigBlockOfCheeseDay, tweeted Carol Layne (@keddle01).  Chuck Badger (@CharlesBadger) tweeted: I think you have to be a West Wing fan to truly appreciate the glory that is #BigBlockOfCheeseDay today. Big Block of Cheese Day was intended as a nod both to President Jackson and The West Wing, and to make the administration more accessible, the White House said in its blog. The event drew serious responses from administration officials such as Valerie Jarrett, a senior Obama adviser, and Labor Secretary Tom Perez. Asked about plans for the minimum wage, Perez (@LaborSec) tweeted: Americans shouldnt have to win the geographic lottery for fair paycheck. Need to #RaiseTheWage #BigBlockOfCheeseDay.   Other officials such as first lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough were also expected to take part.   Twitter users were invited to use the hashtag #AskTheWH along with #BigBlockOfCheeseDay to get their questions answered.  ",1.0

 WATCH: Rep. Adam Schiff Draws A BRILLIANT And DAMNING Map Of Events Connecting Trump To Russia,"The investigations into the Trump-Russia scandal are an increasing problem for Trump as he desperately tries to steer any and all spotlights away from him and onto, well, pretty much everything else. Unfortunately for him, Rep. Adam Schiff drew an absolutely brilliant map between Trump and Russia during his statement this morning.Schiff left absolutely nothing out of his statement. His map is as follows:Schiff does acknowledge that all of this could just be a bunch of wild coincidences, but with a caveat: Is it possible that all of these events and reports are completely unrelated, and nothing more than an entirely unhappy coincidence? Yes, it is possible. But it is also possible, maybe more than possible, that they are not coincidental, not disconnected and not unrelated, and that the Russians used the same techniques to corrupt U.S. persons that they have employed in Europe and elsewhere. We simply don t know, not yet, and we owe it to the country to find out. He s right. When mapped out, this string of  coincidences  is pretty damning indeed. We need an investigation, and if Trump really were innocent, he and his minions would likely not be trying to deflect. They d be saying,  Go ahead, investigate us! Investigate to your heart s content! You won t find anything. But they aren t. This scandal is about to blow up again.

 April Ryan Describes In Harrowing Detail What It Feels Like To Be Abused By Sean Spicer (VIDEO),"By now, everyone is aware of the appallingly abusive way in which White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer treated American Urban Radio Correspondent April Ryan during Tuesday s White House Press briefing. All Ryan was doing was, well, HER JOB, and asking about the cloud of Russia investigations hanging over the embattled Trump Administration. This caused Sean Spicer to completely lose it, and launch into condescending, sexist, and racist attacks on Ryan.After the press availability was over, Ryan spoke with MSNBC s Katy Tur about her experience, addressing the accusation from Sean Spicer that she was pushing an agenda rather than just reporting the facts. Ryan told Tur: I don t have an agenda. We ve never seen anything like this before and my question was simple, how do you change the perception problem? And it went off into this Russian dressing, no shaking my head or whatever. You cannot ignore, as a reporter, there are issues on Capitol Hill. You have investigations going. You have the head of the intel committee coming here to the White House briefing people, the president himself. I understand what Sean is doing  trying to make this administration look better than what it does right now. And unfortunately, I was roadkill today. No matter what Sean Spicer s job is, he had not right to treat April Ryan that way. She was just doing her job. If he can t handle tough questions, he should find another line of work. To flat-out deny all of those investigations, and to accuse the press of being at fault for the fact that the criminal activity that is clearly taking place inside the Trump White House is a huge story is truly beyond the pale. Until they come clean about the Russia business, this will continue to be a story. The White House Press Corp would derelict in their duties if they didn t continue to press Spicer on this.Good on you for being a superb member of the Fourth Estate, Ms. Ryan. You handled Spicer s abuse with grace and dignity. Believe me, he s the one who comes out looking worse for wear on this one.Watch the video below, via Real Clear Politics:Featured image via video screen capture",0.0
"Republican Cruz, hoping to revive struggling campaign, taps Fiorina as No. 2 ","INDIANAPOLIS (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, in a last-ditch bid to slow front-runner Donald Trumps momentum, named former business executive Carly Fiorina on Wednesday as his vice presidential running mate should he win the nomination. After crushing losses to Trump in five nominating contests in the Northeast on Tuesday, Cruz praised Fiorina, a former presidential rival, as a principled fighter for conservative values who would be a valuable ally on the campaign trail. Carly is a vice presidential nominee who I think is superbly skilled, superbly gifted at helping unite this party, the U.S. senator from Texas told a rally in Indianapolis, the capital of Indiana. The Midwestern state is the next battleground for selecting the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates for the Nov. 8 presidential election and is shaping up to be Cruzs best - and perhaps last - chance to block Trumps march to the nomination. Cruz acknowledged it was unusual to choose a running mate so early in the race. Traditionally, the winners of the Republican and Democratic nominating races announce their running mates in the period between clinching the nomination and summers national conventions. I think all would acknowledge this race, if anything, it is unusual, said Cruz, 45, adding he wanted to give voters a clear choice and offer a rebuttal to media suggestions the Republican race was over. At a nearby rally in Indianapolis afterward, Trump was scornful of Cruzs move, calling his rival desperate.  In the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton, 68, won four of Tuesdays five contests, building a virtually insurmountable lead over rival Bernie Sanders, a 74-year-old U.S. senator from Vermont, who vowed to keep fighting until the July convention. In tapping Fiorina as his No. 2, Cruz was apparently trying to recover from Trumps landslide primary wins on Tuesday in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Connecticut and Rhode Island. The victories made the uphill climb toward the nomination even steeper for Cruz. Ive had tough fights all my life, Fiorina said after Cruz introduced her. Tough fights dont worry me a bit. Fiorina, 61, dropped her own White House bid in February after a seventh-place finish in New Hampshire. She endorsed Cruz a month later and has been a sharp critic of Clinton. Fiorina and Cruz both said they had grown close since her endorsement, and she sang a few verses of a song she said she sings to Cruzs two daughters on their campaign bus.  The choice of Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard Co chief executive who, like Trump, has never held elective office, could help Cruz with women voters, a group that Trump has had difficulty winning over to his outsider campaign. It also could offer Cruz a boost in the June 7 primary in California, where Fiorina won the Republican primary in 2010 for the U.S. Senate. She was defeated in the general election by incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer. Fiorina now lives in Virginia. Trump has amassed 987 of the 1,237 Republican national convention delegates he needs to secure the nomination, to 562 for Cruz and 153 for Ohio Governor John Kasich, 63, the third remaining candidate, according to the Associated Press. If Cruz can win a large share of Indianas 57 delegates, it will increase the chances that Trump will not be able to win the nomination on the conventions first ballot. After that, many delegates will be free to turn to Cruz, Kasich or a dark-horse establishment candidate on a second or subsequent ballot. A loss to Trump in Indiana would effectively cripple Cruzs bid, and increase pressure on the party to rally around Trump as the prospective nominee.  Trump called Cruzs decision to pick a running mate a pure waste of time and a desperate attempt to save a failing campaign by an all-talk, no-action politician. He is the first presidential candidate in the history of this country whos mathematically eliminated from becoming president who chose a vice presidential candidate. ... Its a record, the New York billionaire and former reality TV star told supporters in Indianapolis on Wednesday. Trump vowed to campaign extensively in the state between now and Tuesdays nominating contest.  Im not playing games with Indiana, he said. You are going to get so tired of me. Were going to win it, he said. Trump was introduced at the rally by famed college basketball coach Bob Knight, who led Indiana University to three national championships.  Cruz said Fiorina had already proven her mettle in standing up to Trump last year after he insulted her looks in an interview. Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? Trump had asked, only to be sternly rebuked by Fiorina in their next presidential debate. Shes faced challenges a lot worse than someone bellowing and yelling and insulting her face, Cruz told the Indianapolis crowd. A breast cancer survivor who lost a stepdaughter to drug addiction, Fiorina served as Hewlett-Packard chief executive from 1999 to 2005. She was forced to resign amid weak earnings as the company struggled to digest a $19 billion merger with Compaq Computer Corp. About 30,000 layoffs took place during her tenure. Fiorinas campaign never took off in the original 17-member Republican presidential field, and she was mostly relegated to the early second-tier debates for low-polling candidates. Craig Robinson, a former political director of the Iowa Republican Party, said Cruz would have been better off picking an experienced politician who could help him secure delegates in a fight at the convention.  Its a real head-scratcher, he said. But some conservatives applauded Cruzs choice. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which works to elect political candidates who oppose abortion rights, said Fiorina was the ideal choice. She will take Hillary Clinton head-on, Dannenfelser said in a statement. ",1.0
"Rejuvenated Berlusconi lays out vote platform, eyes victory in Italy","ROME (Reuters) - Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, marking a formal return to Italy s political stage, laid out his policy priorities on Sunday for the forthcoming election, portraying himself as a pro-European moderate. Speaking at a meeting of his Forza Italia (Go Italy) party, Berlusconi said he wanted to lead the group into the national ballot, which is expected by next March, promising hefty tax cuts if the center-right regained power. Subsumed by sex scandals and legal woes, Berlusconi largely vanished from politics after being ousted from power in 2011.  But he has emerged from the shadows this year and Forza Italia, with its traditional rightist allies the Northern League and Brothers of Italy, have combined backing of some 35 percent, according to polls, making them the largest single bloc.  We predict a great victory for the center-right,  said Berlusconi, 81, looking thin and fit during a speech near Rome that effectively launched the Forza Italia election campaign. While his allies have repeatedly denounced the European Union, Berlusconi said he wanted more Europe, not less, calling for common defense, foreign, industrial and fiscal policies.  I do not think we can leave the euro,  he said, further underscoring how the anti-euro rhetoric once heard from many Italian parties is receding as the vote nears. Berlusconi, who had open heart surgery last year, cannot run for office due to a 2013 tax fraud conviction. But he hopes the European Court of Human Rights overturns this ban when it reviews his case in November.  I expect that Europe completely restores my honor ... But court or no court, I promise you that I will take part in the election campaign,  said the four-times premier. If Forza Italia won power, he said he would introduce a flat tax and eliminate inheritance tax, hike minimum pensions, offer pensions to housewives and give more to impoverished families. Berlusconi dismissed the chances of the ruling center-left, saying the left was in retreat across Europe, and also took aim at the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which polls say is Italy s largest single party, with support under 30 percent. The 5-Star is expected to chose the 31-year-old lawmaker Luigi Di Maio as its prime ministerial candidate next weekend. Berlusconi dismissed him as a  little political meteorite  with no practical know-how. Highlighting his own long experience in business and politics, he said he wanted to make a pact with the devil to take 20 years off his life. He joked this his tan, brown hair and slim figure showed a deal might have been struck. He also looked to swat down the hopes of Northern League leader Matteo Salvini, who has put himself forward as the natural prime ministerial candidate for the center-right.  We have always had respect for their ideas, but we created the center-right and we have always been the leader to put its program into action,  Berlusconi said. ",1.0

Trump strikes blow at Iran nuclear deal in major U.S. policy shift,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump struck a blow against the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement on Friday in defiance of other world powers, choosing not to certify that Tehran is complying with the deal and warning he might ultimately terminate it. Trump announced the major shift in U.S. policy in a speech in which he detailed a more aggressive approach to Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and its support for extremist groups in the Middle East. He accused Iran of  not living up to the spirit  of the nuclear agreement and said his goal is to ensure Tehran never obtains a nuclear weapon, in effect throwing the fate of the deal to Congress.  He singled out Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for sanctions and delivered a blistering critique of Tehran, which he accused of destabilizing actions in Syria, Yemen and Iraq.  We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror and the very real threat of Iran s nuclear breakout,  Trump said. Trump s hardline remarks drew praise from Israel, Iran s arch-foe, but was criticized by European allies. The move by Trump was part of his  America First  approach to international agreements which has led him to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade talks and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. His Iran strategy angered Tehran and put Washington at odds with other signatories of the accord - Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union - some of which have benefited economically from renewed trade with Iran. Responding to Trump, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday on television that Tehran was committed to the deal and accused Trump of making baseless accusations.  The Iranian nation has not and will never bow to any foreign pressure,  he said.  Iran and the deal are stronger than ever.  European allies have warned of a split with the United States over the nuclear agreement and say that putting it in limbo as Trump has done undermines U.S. credibility abroad, especially as international inspectors say Iran is in compliance with the accord.                 The chief of the U.N. atomic watchdog reiterated that Iran was under the world s  most robust nuclear verification regime.   The nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran under the JCPOA are being implemented,  Yukiya Amano, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency said, referring to the deal by its formal name. U.S. Democrats expressed skepticism at Trump s decision. Senator Ben Cardin said:  At a moment when the United States and its allies face a nuclear crisis with North Korea, the president has manufactured a new crisis that will isolate us from our allies and partners.  While Trump did not pull the United States out of the agreement, he gave the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact. If Congress reimposes the sanctions, the United States would in effect be in violation of the terms of the nuclear deal and it would likely fall apart. If lawmakers do nothing, the deal remains in place. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker was working on amending the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act law to include  trigger points  that if crossed by Iran would automatically reimpose U.S. sanctions. The trigger points would address strengthening nuclear inspections, Iran s ballistic missile program and eliminate the deal s  sunset clauses  under which some of the restrictions on Iran s nuclear program expire over time.  Trump directed U.S. intelligence agencies to probe whether Iran might be working with North Korea on its weapons programs. The president, who took office in January, had reluctantly certified the agreement twice before but has repeatedly blasted it as  the worst deal ever.  It was negotiated under his predecessor, former President Barack Obama. Trump warned that if  we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.   We ll see what happens over the next short period of time and I can do that instantaneously,  he told reporters when asked why he did not choose to scrap the deal now. The Trump administration designated the entire Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps under an executive order targeting terrorists. The administration stopped short of labeling the group a Foreign Terrorist Organization, a list maintained by the State Department. The Revolutionary Guard is the single most dominant player in Iran s security, political, and economic systems and wields enormous influence in Iran s domestic and foreign policies. It had already previously been sanctioned by the United States under other authorities, and the immediate impact of Friday s measure is likely to be symbolic. The U.S. military said on Friday it was identifying new areas where it could work with allies to put pressure on Iran in support of Trump s new strategy and was reviewing the positioning of U.S. forces. But U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said no changes in force posture had been made yet, and Iran had not responded to Trump s announcement with any provocative acts so far. ",1.0
"In Pakistan's coal rush, some women drivers break cultural barriers","ISLAMKOT, Pakistan (Reuters) - As Pakistan bets on cheap coal in the Thar desert to resolve its energy crisis, a select group of women is eyeing a road out of poverty by snapping up truck-driving jobs that once only went to men. Such work is seen as life-changing in this dusty southern region bordering India, where sand dunes cover estimated coal reserves of 175 billion tonnes and yellow dumper trucks swarm like bees around Pakistan s largest open-pit mine. The imposing 60-tonne trucks initially daunted Gulaban, 25, a housewife and mother of three from Thar s Hindu community inside the staunchly conservative and mainly-Muslim nation of 208 million people.  At the beginning I was a bit nervous but now it s normal to drive this dumper,  said Gulaban, clad in a pink saree, a traditional cloth worn by Hindu women across South Asia. Gulaban - who hopes such jobs can help empower other women facing grim employment prospects - is among 30 women being trained to be truck drivers by Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC), a Pakistani firm digging up low-grade coal under the rolling Thar sand dunes. Gulaban has stolen the march on her fellow trainees because she was the only woman who knew how to drive a car before training to be a truck driver. She is an inspiration to her fellow students.  If Gulaban can drive a dump truck then why not we? All we need to do is learn and drive quickly like her,  said Ramu, 29, a mother of six, standing beside the 40-tonne truck.  Until recently, energy experts were uncertain that Pakistan s abundant but poor-quality coal could be used to fire up power plants. That view began to change with new technology and Chinese investment as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a key branch of Beijing s Belt and Road initiative to connect Asia with Europe and Africa. Now coal, along with hydro and liquefied natural gas, is at the heart of Pakistan s energy plans. SECMC, which has about 125 dump trucks ferrying earth out of the pit mine, estimates it will need 300-400 trucks once they burrow deep enough to reach the coal. Drivers can earn up to 40,000 rupees ($380) a month.  Women aspiring to these jobs are overcoming cultural barriers in a society where women are restricted to mainly working the fields and cooking and cleaning for the family. Only this week in Saudi Arabia, a close ally of Pakistan, women were granted permission to drive for the first time ever, ending a ban that was supported by conservative clerics but seen by rights activists as an emblem of suppression. Gulaban s husband, Harjilal, recalled how people in Thar would taunt him when his  illiterate  wife drove their small car.  When I sit in the passenger seat with my wife driving, people used to laugh at me,  said Harjilal, who like most of the people in the community only has one name. But Gulaban, seeking to throw stereotypes out of the window, is only focused on the opportunities ahead.   As I can see our other female trainees getting paid and their life is changing,  Gulaban added.  I hope...for a better future.  ",1.0
Lebanon's Jumblatt criticizes Saudi over Hariri,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Top Lebanese Druze politician Walid Jumblatt on Friday criticized the way Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri had been treated by  some Saudi circles , the first time he has appeared to direct blame at Riyadh over Hariri s resignation this month. Jumblatt also condemned Iranian  dictates , an apparent response to a statement by the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards this week that disarming of the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah was out of the question. Lebanese officials say Saudi Arabia put Hariri under effective house arrest in Riyadh and forced him to declare his resignation on Nov. 4. Saudi Arabia has denied holding Hariri against his will or forcing him to resign. Hariri shelved his resignation on Wednesday after returning to Beirut this week following an intervention by France. His resignation had thrust Lebanon to the forefront of the regional tussle between the Sunni monarchy of Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Islamist Iran.  As Lebanese disapproved the unaccustomed way that Sheikh Saad was dealt with by some Saudi circles, we reject this Iranian diktat from Mohammad Ali Jafari, commander of the Revolutionary Guards,  Jumblatt wrote. He appeared to be referring to Jafari s comment that disarming the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah was out of the question.  The Lebanese have enough experience and knowledge to deal with their affairs through dialogue. We do not want dictates from across the borders that go against their interests,  Jumblatt said. Announcing his decision to suspend his resignation, Hariri stressed Lebanon must stick by its stated policy of staying out of regional conflicts, a reference to Hezbollah whose regional military role is a source of deep concern in Saudi Arabia.

Rising tension spurs Malaysia to ban travel to North Korea,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia on Thursday banned citizens from traveling to North Korea, scotching yet again its soccer team s participation in an Asian Cup qualifying match, as tension rises on the Korean peninsula over missile and nuclear development by Pyongyang. Malaysia is one of the handful of countries that still has friendly diplomatic ties with North Korea, but relations have been strained since the murder of Kim Jong Un s half brother at the airport in the Malaysian capital this year. The travel ban will be reviewed once the situation has returned to normal, the Malaysian foreign ministry said in a statement. The ban also covers the Malaysian soccer team s trip to Pyongyang for an Oct 5 match, deputy foreign minister Rizal Merican Naina Merican said.   The travel ban covers all Malaysians, and as Malaysians, the Malaysian national football team is included too,  Reezal told Reuters. The news led to the match being postponed for a third time, with the Asian Football Confederation saying in a brief statement the situation would be  referred to the appropriate committees to decide on the future status of this match . The regional body said it decided to postpone the match after the Football Association of Malaysia told it of the travel ban. The match had been postponed to June 8 from its original date of March 28, but both dates were scrapped because of Malaysia s fears for its players  safety.  Last week, North Korea granted the president of the regional body, Malaysian royal Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim, access to its airspace  anytime  he wants, as Pyongyang prepared to host the Asian Cup tie.

"Syria fighting worst since Aleppo, air strikes deadly: aid agencies","GENEVA (Reuters) - Syria is in the throes of its worst fighting since the battle for eastern Aleppo last year, with heavy air strikes causing hundreds of civilian casualties, aid agencies said on Thursday. Hospitals, schools and people fleeing violence have been  targeted by direct air strikes  that may amount to war crimes, the United Nations said, without apportioning blame. Russia and a U.S.-led coalition are carrying out separate air strikes in Syria ostensibly aimed at defeating Islamic State militants.   September was the deadliest month of 2017 for civilians with daily reports of attacks on residential areas resulting in hundreds of conflict-related deaths and injuries,  U.N. regional humanitarian coordinator Panos Moumtzis said in a statement. Air strikes killed dozens this week in Raqqa, where 8,000 people remain trapped, and at least 149 people, mostly women and children, in residential areas of rebel-dominated Idlib province in Syria s northwest in the last 12 days of September, he said. Explosions in Damascus killed 20 people and civilian casualties were also reported in rural areas around the Syrian capital and in Hama, Aleppo and Deir al-Zor, Moumtzis said, again without saying who was responsible. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in a statement that up to 10 hospitals were reported to have been damaged in the past 10 days.   We have seen a number of hospitals being targeted, we got very worrying reports and converging reports about hospitals, schools, civilian infrastructure being targeted,  Robert Mardini, ICRC regional director for the Middle East, told Reuters in an interview in his Geneva office.  And of course this is outrageous, unacceptable,  he said, adding that damage to Sham hospital in Idlib alone had cut off half a million people from access to health care. The ICRC voiced alarm that violence was occurring in many of the  de-escalation  areas including Idlib, rural Hama and eastern Ghouta.  Taken together, these are the worst levels of violence since the battle for Aleppo in 2016,  it said.  Hundreds of civilians killed is certainly a very conservative figure,  Mardini said.  We see a very strong correlation between the escalation and the intensification in the fighting on one hand and the human cost of this conflict, the attacks on health facilities and civilian infrastructure.  Syria s six-year-old civil war pits President Bashar al-Assad s government supported by Russia and Iran against a myriad number of rebel factions, some Western-backed, and Islamist militant groups. Military jets believed to be Russian killed at least 60 civilians trying to flee heavy fighting in the oil-rich Deir al-Zor province when their small boats were targeted as they sought to cross the Euphrates River, opposition activists, former residents and a war monitor said late on Wednesday. The U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State in Syria has carried out air strikes that have also caused civilian casualties, which it says it goes to great lengths to avoid.  The point here is not to point fingers,  Mardini said, declining to identify suspected perpetrators of deadly strikes.  What should be non-negotiable is the respect for the laws of war, everywhere in Syria. This is absolutely critical today.   ",1.0
"Under pressure, PM May says she can steer Britain through Brexit","MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Apologizing for losing her Conservative Party s majority at a June election, Prime Minister Theresa May responded to her critics on Sunday by saying she had the right strategy to lead Britain and win a Brexit deal. May, who has faced calls from within her party to step down, wants to use the Conservatives  annual conference in the northern English city of Manchester this week to try to reset her agenda, offering money to students and those people she once described as  just about managing  in Britain. In an interview with BBC television, she dismissed talk of  rifts among top ministers, saying they were united on their program and more importantly Brexit. That came a day after foreign minister Boris Johnson, perhaps May s biggest rival, set out four personal red lines in the complex talks with the EU. But with thousands of protesters just outside the conference center gates demanding Britain stay in the European Union, May has a long way to go to unite not only her governing party, but also the country after last year s divisive referendum vote.  We ve listened to the message that came from that (June) election. But I ve been very clear, I called the election, I led the campaign, I take my responsibility and I m sorry that some very good members of parliament lost their seats,  May said in an appeal to those party members still angry over the vote.  What I have is a cabinet that is united in the mission of this government ... and agreed on the approach that we took in Florence,  May said about a speech she made in Italy last month to try to kick-start Brexit talks that had all but stalled.   Boris is absolutely behind the Florence speech and the line that we have taken.  Arriving at the conference, Johnson was quick to say he was loyal to the prime minister. But he has yet to comment further on his four red lines, which include a transition period of no longer than two years, that he set out on the eve of the conference in what his critics said was a clear move to pressure May. Minster after minister appealed for unity from a party deeply disillusioned by the June election, with several saying the only way to win back voters was to challenge the growing appeal of the main opposition Labour Party directly.   I think one of the problems we have at the moment and what kind of rankles with me a little bit is that we have got to stop talking about the party,  trade minister Liam Fox told an event.  The party needs to stop talking about the party and start talking more about the country.  Following a bullish Labour conference last week, May hopes to fire up thousands of Conservative party members who feel let down by a disastrous election campaign, when their leader was dubbed by critics  the Maybot  for her repetition of slogans. May is now dependent on a small Northern Irish party for a majority in parliament, and opinion polls indicate Labour is a growing threat, persuading rivals in the party not to try to topple her quite yet. On her 61st birthday, she unveiled new policies to extend a program to help people buy their own homes and to freeze student tuition fees to try to win back younger people, who have flocked to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. She offered Brexit supporters a promise that she would walk away if she could not get a good deal, saying the government was working on plans for a  no deal ; and tried to keep pro-EU campaigners onside by saying she wanted an agreement. May s ally and effective deputy Damian Green said he was confident she could lead the Conservatives into the next election in 2022 and criticized those fuelling leadership speculation that hampers  a job not just for the party but more importantly for the government and the country . But May has a long way to go to win over doubters.  If you run any organization ... and something goes monumentally wrong, as did the election ... then the buck does have to stop with that individual,  said Grant Shapps, former Conservative Party chairman.   The reality is, every serious person knows, of course she can t lead us into the next election.  ",1.0
U.S. to open new vetting agency for 'secret' security clearances,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government will open the doors next week to a new agency, with stronger data protections, meant to shorten by many weeks the time it takes to vet government workers seeking secret and top secret security clearances. The National Background Investigations Bureau will be headed by Charles Phalen, who has worked as a security executive at the CIA, the FBI and defense contractor Northrop Grumman, officials said on Thursday on a conference call with reporters. The bureau will replace an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) clearance system that was hit by hackers who stole potentially sensitive personal data on as many as 22 million people, including government employees and job applicants. Phalen and OPM Director Beth Cobert said a top priority for the bureau will be shortening delays in the clearance process, which can hold up the hiring of government employees for months. Cobert said that OPM figures show on average the time required to complete an investigation for a secret level security clearance is now 120 days; for a top secret clearance, it is 170 days on average. These timelines are well too long, Phelan acknowledged. Cobert said the new agencys goal would be to reduce the time for completing a secret clearance to 40 days and to cut the time for a top secret investigation to 80 days. Officials said that individual government agencies, rather than the new central investigations bureau, would be responsible for social media checks of security clearance applicants.  Officials said that the new bureau would still depend on outside contractors, especially for hiring field investigators. The new agency will employ 2,500 government workers and 6,000 contract employees, officials said. ",1.0
Hacking attacks: a pre-election setback for Italy's 5-Star Movement,"ROME (Reuters) - Hacking attacks on the web platform used by Italy s 5-Star Movement to select representatives and shape policy threaten to dent confidence in its methods before a parliamentary election it is well placed to win. Internet-based direct democracy, in which members vote online, is a hallmark of the anti-establishment group that first entered parliament in 2013 and leads many opinion polls before the election, due to be held by May.  Gianroberto Casaleggio, the late internet guru who co-founded 5-Star in 2009, believed the web would eventually supplant representative democracy, the system under which all eligible citizens vote on representatives to pass laws for them. But in August anonymous hackers broke into 5-Star s web platform, called  Rousseau  after the 18th century Swiss-born philosopher, and obtained secret data on its members and donors. It is unclear whether there will be any impact on 5-Star s election performance. But if it cannot secure its web platforms, it will be hard to continue using the online methods that set it apart from other political groups.  Public worries over theft of personal data could also make it difficult for 5-Star to attract new members. It already has only a modest membership although it has won millions of votes at the polls with promises to clean up politics and offer universal income support for the poor.  The hacking problem is very serious for 5-Star because it undermines the credibility of their direct democracy message,  sociology professor Luca Ricolfi told Reuters.  It will probably be overshadowed by bigger issues ahead of the election, but it hurts their image and is something they will absolutely have to resolve.  Casaleggio Associati, a web consultancy company that runs 5-Star s platforms and is headed by Gianroberto s son Davide, said security would be improved before the online election of the movement s new leader last month. Despite this, the election was dogged by hacking attacks which hampered voting and contributed to only 37,000 of 5-Star s 140,000 members casting an online ballot. The voting deadline had to be extended twice as members were unable to log on or connect to necessary web pages.  One hacker published screenshots showing the system had been infiltrated again and that it had been possible to vote several times using the accounts of certified 5-Star members.  Rousseau s content systems are outdated and its level of security is totally inadequate,  said David Puente, a computer expert and web developer who worked for Casaleggio Associati for four-and-a-half years until 2011. Umberto Rapetto, a cyber security expert who used to head the computer crime division of Italy s finance police, called Rousseau  a rudimentary platform with a host of weak points . Davide Casaleggio declined to answer questions for this article. Puente, a 5-Star member, said it would now be hard to update Rousseau without sacrificing many functions that have been added recently, meaning the only solution was to  dismantle everything and start all over again.  That would not be easy even if Casaleggio agreed. Hackers around the world have regularly penetrated the computer systems of public agencies and multinational companies with millions of euros to spend on cyber security. Casaleggio Associati has fewer than 20 employees, posted revenues of less than a million euros in 2016 and has run a loss for the last three years. 5-Star s new leader, 31-year-old Luigi Di Maio, says Rousseau s problems are understandable as it is a  startup  launched only last year. He says web-based democracy can work not only in 5-Star but in all branches of Italian politics. Yet many computer experts are skeptical about both Rousseau and internet democracy in general. One common criticism is a lack of transparency, as in only two of 5-Star s dozens of online votes has Casaleggio named an independent company to verify the regularity of the process. Critics also say there can be no guarantee that voters are anonymous to platform managers, or that the voter casts only one ballot or is not watched or coerced while he votes.  Creating a structure that offers the same guarantees as paper ballots would be incredibly difficult,  said cyber security strategist Corrado Giustozzi, a member of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security.

Philippines set to keep open pit mining ban as Duterte rejects call to lift it,"MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippine environment minister said on Wednesday that a ban on new open pit mining in the country would remain in place, with President Rodrigo Duterte rejecting government panel recommendations to reverse it. The ban, implemented by former environment minister Regina Lopez from April covers new projects including the $5.9-billion copper-gold Tampakan project in southern Mindanao island, the biggest stalled mining venture in the Southeast Asian nation.  The President sets the policy. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources will implement what the President deems as best for the country s interest,  Environment and Natural Resources Secretary Roy Cimatu told Reuters in a text message. Open pit mining is allowed under the laws of the Southeast Asian country, the world s top nickel ore exporter, where many mines use it to extract minerals. But Lopez said the process ruins the economic potential of places where it is carried out. Duterte said late on Tuesday that he had rejected a recommendation by the Mining Industry Coordinating Council (MICC) to lift the ban because such mining is  destroying the soil and environment and no corrective measure is immediately (being) implemented . He added that while mining brings  good profit , he  can let it go . The comments by the firebrand leader followed an announcement on Monday by his spokesman that Duterte had not reversed the ban. The MICC, an inter-agency panel that makes recommendations on mining policy, is chaired by Cimatu and Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez. Cimatu said last month that he supported the removal of the open pit ban and that his agency would strengthen regulations to prevent any excesses by miners. The ban would further halt development of the Tampakan project in the southern South Cotabato province. The project was first stopped after South Cotabato banned open-pit mining in 2010, and operator Glencore Plc quit the project five years later. Lopez, who stepped down in May after failing to win congressional confirmation after 10 months in office, has said the project would cover an area the size of 700 soccer fields in what otherwise would be agricultural land. Also covered by the ban is the $1.2 billion Silangan copper and gold mine in Mindanao by Philippine miner Philex Mining Corp. ",1.0
Expelled refugee student kills seven in Kenyan school,"ISIOLO, Kenya (Reuters) - An expelled student shot dead six of his former schoolmates and a security guard at his school in northern Kenya on Saturday, and was then himself lynched by a furious mob, officials said. The attack took place at a school in the remote town of Lokichogio in Kenya s Turkana region, close to the border with war-torn South Sudan. At least six other students were flown to hospital with bullet wounds. The assailant was a 17-year-old from South Sudan - one of thousands of refugee children who have been living in Kenya and going to school there since civil war broke out in their country in 2013. He was detained in possession of an AK-47, the basic assault rifle of choice in conflicts across Africa and the Middle East.   The school was not attacked by bandits but an errant student on expulsion for disciplinary cases,  regional government official Wanyama Musyambohe told reporters. Security officials said the assailant, whose name has not been disclosed, had been arrested, but then killed by a mob while in police custody.  The attack ... is a painful reminder of the state of insecurity along the border,  tweeted Turkana county governor Josphat Nanok. Close to 2 million people have fled South Sudan since fighting broke out in December 2013, sparking what has become Africa s largest cross-border exodus since the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Some 75,000 of them are now in Kenya. Perennial conflicts have left the region awash with arms, which are smuggled across borders with relative ease. ",1.0
"ARMY OF ISIS Scientists Ready To Wage War Against EU: Have Already Smuggled Chemical, Biological And Nuclear Weapons Across Borders","But wait If WMD s have been banned by the international community, how is it possible for ISIS to use them against the West? Is the Left finally waking up to realize bad guys don t follow the rules? ISIS already has smuggled chemical and biological weapons into the EU The terror organisation has also recruited chemists and physicists Western governments warned to alert the public about potential attackISIS has recruited experts with chemistry, physics and computer science degrees to wage war with weapons of mass destruction against the West, a shocking European Parliament report has claimed.The terror organisation, according to the briefing document,  may be planning to try to use internationally banned weapons of mass destruction in future attacks .The document, which was compiled in the aftermath of the deadly attacks on Paris claimed that ISIS has already smuggled WMD material into Europe.Experts fear that ISIS will be able to exploit a failure of EU governments to share information on possible terrorists. Already, British police forces have been conducting exercises on how to deal with various types of terrorist attack. But the EU report claims that government should  consider publicly addressing the possibility of terrorist attack using chemical, biological, radiological or even nuclear materials .The report, ISIL/Da esh and  non-conventional  weapons of terror warns:  At present, European citizens are not seriously contemplating the possibility that extremist groups might use chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) materials during attacks in Europe. Under these circumstances, the impact of such an attack, should it occur, would be even more destabilising. Rob Wainwright, head of Europol said after the attacks on Paris:  We are dealing with a very serious, well-resourced, determined international terrorist organisation that is now active on the streets of Europe. This represents the most serious terrorist threat faced in Europe for 10 years. Mr Wainwright warned that ISIS had serious capabilities in terms of resources and manpower. Intelligence services have also been warned to screen returning Jihadi fighters for  specialist CBRN knowledge .  Interpol s monthly CBRN intelligence reports show numerous examples of attempts to acquire, smuggle or use CBRN materials.   Via: UK Daily Mail ",0.0
"After weeks of secrecy, Senate to unveil healthcare bill","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans plan to unveil the text of their draft healthcare bill on Thursday as senators struggle over issues such as the future of the Medicaid program for the poor and bringing down insurance costs. Republicans in the chamber have been working for weeks behind closed doors on legislation aimed at repealing and replacing major portions of the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare. The effort has been plagued from the start by tensions between moderates and conservatives, which surfaced again on Tuesday. Democrats have also criticized the behind-the-scenes meetings, staging a protest on the Senate floor on Monday. Republicans are writing their healthcare bill under the cover of darkness because they are ashamed of it, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer charged.  President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to repeal Obamacare. The 2010 law extended insurance coverage to millions of Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives narrowly approved its version of repeal last month. Trump has urged the Republican-led Senate to pass a more generous bill than that approved by the House, whose version he privately called mean, according to congressional sources. An estimated 23 million people could lose their healthcare under the House plan, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday the Senate healthcare bill would be different from the House version, but he did not elaborate. In the Senate, moderates including Senator Shelley Moore Capito have argued for a long, seven-year phase-out to the Medicaid expansion that happened under Obamacare. But Senator John Thune, a member of the Republican leadership, said on Tuesday the phase-out in the bill might just be three years. Capito said on Tuesday she was also concerned the Senate healthcare plan might cap Medicaid spending and shift it to a lower growth rate in 2025. Thats an issue, she said. Senate conservatives also seemed wary of the emerging bill. Ted Cruz, a member of a core group of 13 Republicans who have been working on the legislation, told reporters the bill did not yet do enough to lower health insurance premiums. If it is going to pass, the bill is going to have to make meaningful steps to reduce premiums, he said. Given the opposition of all Senate Democrats to repealing Obamacare, Republican leaders will need the support of at least 50 of the chambers 52 Republicans to ensure passage. McConnell announced a discussion draft would be laid out on Thursday. The bill will be brought to the Senate floor once the CBO has assessed its cost and impact, likely next week, McConnell said. Thune said the bill was not yet finalized, saying: Were trying to get definitive determinations on a range of issues. Vice President Mike Pence predicted that new healthcare legislation would be enacted this summer. I want to assure you, before this summer is over ... President Donald Trump and this Congress will keep their promise to the American people, and we will repeal and replace Obamacare, Pence told a meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers.

Yemen's ex-president Saleh stable after Russian medics operate,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemen s ex-president Ali Abdullah Saleh has had a successful operation at a Sanaa hospital after a Russian medical team was flown in to perform it, government sources said on Saturday.  The Russian team arrived in Sanaa two days ago and operated on Saleh on Friday for wounds he sustained in an assassination attempt in 2011.  Saleh s General People s Congress Party said the procedure was successful, and that his condition was stable.  Saleh was severely wounded in an attack on the presidential palace in Sanaa in June 2011. He went to the United States for treatment on one occasion, before a travel ban was imposed. The United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on Saleh in 2014, accusing him of threatening peace and obstructing Yemen s political process, subjecting him to a global travel ban and an asset freeze.  Government sources told Reuters the Russian team had arrived with approval from the Saudi-led Arab alliance but did not reveal the precise nature of the surgery.  Saleh ruled Yemen for 34 years, but was forced from power after pro-democracy protests in 2012.  Forming a surprise alliance with the Houthi movement when they seized Sanaa in 2014, Saleh s army loyalists and Houthi fighters have weathered thousands of air strikes by the Saudi-led military coalition in more than two years of war.

[Video] POLICE HAVE VERY GOOD REASON FOR BLOCKING NEWLY ELECTEDMAYOR From Entering City Hall Office,"This mayor s involvement in potential illegal activity will get little attention this story will be a full blown case of racial injustice in 5 4 3 2 1  Betty McCray, newly-elected mayor of Kinloch, Missouri, showed up at City Hall this week to get to work. But when she arrived, the police wouldn t let her in the door.The reason why? Those non-existent illegal voters who cast ballots for the candidate.The election, which was held April 7, was hotly contested and the results have been questioned by McCray s opponents. However, the St. Louis County Board of Elections certified the results and swore McCray in after city officials refused to.The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that deputies met her in the parking lot, and she was served with articles of impeachment by City Attorney James Robinson. Robinson also told her that she was suspended.After being blocked from entering the building, McCray held a press conference in the parking lot:  I won. The people spoke,  McCray told the press after she had been served papers and told she could not enter the building.  I was sworn in by the St. Louis County. Today I take office. I want them out, I want the keys.  It was rumored that McCray was going to fire  multiple  city employees, once in office.Kinloch, which is located near Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, once  thrived with more than 10,000 residents.  But airport development has led to homes being purchased by the airport authority and demolished.Today, Kinloch, which has fewer than 300 residents, is marked by pilfered coffers, shady land deals and increasingly bitter fights over the last remnants of political power.During the past five years, the city has seen the imprisonment of a former mayor on federal fraud and theft charges, the hiring of a convicted felon as city manager, the selling of a previous city hall building to an alleged drug dealer and the unseating of at least two aldermen. McCray won the mayoral contest by garnering 38 votes compared to her opponent, the incumbent mayor s, 18.Prior to the election, the city alerted the County Board of Elections said that they believed there were 27 voters registered illegally. McCray s camp alleges that these voters were living in city-owned housing and evicted because they supported her.The bad blood goes back further. McCray is a former Alderman, who served under a mayor who has since been convicted of federal fraud charges. Members of the current administration accuse her of benefiting financially from land deals under that mayor, Keith Conway.McCray told Fox2 she was going to file an injunction in the St. Louis County courts, and then attempt to enter City Hall again.Via: IJReview",0.0

Irish student Ibrahim Halawa freed after four years in Egypt jail,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian authorities have released high-profile Irish detainee Ibrahim Halawa following his acquittal last month of charges including murder, in a four-year mass trial criticized by human rights groups. Halawa, a student, and three of his sisters were charged along with nearly 500 others with a host of crimes including breaking into a mosque, killing 44 people, and illegal possession of firearms in violence that followed the military s overthrow of Egypt s Islamist president, Mohamed Mursi, in 2013. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told Irish national broadcaster RTE on Friday that Halawa was likely to be able to fly home by Monday following his release late on Thursday.   This is a great moment for Ibrahim and his family   a moment for celebration, and a moment for savoring freedom, and I want to wish Ibrahim Halawa and his family all health and happiness for the future,  Coveney said in a separate statement. Egyptian rights activists say they have faced the worst crackdown in their history under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who was elected president in 2014, a year after as armed forces commander he led the military s toppling of Mursi. Halawa was 17 when he was arrested in 2013 with hundreds of others as part of the crackdown on protests. Since then he had been held in pre-trial detention, where he said he was regularly tortured. The defendants in the case had all faced the death penalty but none received it, though hundreds were given sometimes hefty jail sentences. Rights groups welcomed Halawa s release.  After four years of unjust detention, today Ibrahim Halawa finally walks free. He should never have been jailed in the first place and it is utterly outrageous that he was forced to spend a single minute of his young life behind bars.  said Najia Bounaim, North Africa Campaigns Director at Amnesty International. Reuters was not immediately able to reach Halawa s family for comment on Friday, but his sister Fatima told RTE in a radio interview:  It s beyond description ... It s amazing to finally know that Ibrahim is out and he s released and he s safe.  ",1.0
 Republicans Plan To Strangle The Supreme Court To Death In Retaliation For A Hillary Victory,"Making sure that Democrats take control of the Senate just became even more important.Ever since Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, Republicans have refused to let President Obama fill the vacant seat he left behind on the Supreme Court bench. President Obama even nominated Merrick Garland, whom many consider to be a moderate who has even been praised in the past by the very Republicans who are blocking him now.There had been rumors that Republicans may approve his nomination if Hillary Clinton wins the election in order to prevent her from nominating someone more liberal to the post. But now it appears Republicans have something even more sinister in mind if they end up keeping control of the Senate in November.Arizona Senator John McCain, despite joining with his fellow Republicans to declare that the next president should get to pick the next Supreme Court Justice, has already urged Republicans to block any nominee Hillary Clinton puts forward, only to backtrack when outrage ensued over his remarks.But most Republicans think that s a good idea and want to take it even further by letting the Supreme Court die.As we all know, Supreme Court Justices may be appointed to serve for life, but they don t live forever.All of the medical technology and advances in the world are not enough to provide eternal life to humans. So even if every current Justice vows to serve till their last breath, new Justices will eventually be required to make sure the Supreme Court continues.Republicans, however, would rather the high court just disappear instead of doing their jobs by holding confirmation hearings for any of Hillary Clinton s nominees. And they seem to be getting their new playbook from Ilya Shapiro of the Cato Institute, a right-wing organization funded by the Koch brothers.Apparently, Republicans have decided that if they can t get the conservative dominated Court they want, they ll settle for destroying it entirely so that it is no longer a functioning institution. As a matter of constitutional law, the Senate is fully within its powers to let the Supreme Court die out, literally,  Shapiro wrote for The Federalist on Wednesday. I simply can t blame politicians who follow their convictions,  he continued.  If you truly believe that a particular nominee would wreak havoc on America, why not do everything you can to stop him?  So when you get past the gotcha headlines, breathless reportage, and Inauguration Day, if Hillary Clinton is president it would be completely decent, honorable, and in keeping with the Senate s constitutional duty to vote against essentially every judicial nominee she names. In other words, Republicans have no intention of letting the next president pick the next Supreme Court nominee, or any nominee for that matter, unless the next president is Donald Trump. For all their talk of letting the voters decide who gets to pick the next nominee, Republicans are making it clear that they will ignore the will of the people if they elect Hillary Clinton on November 8th and will reject every nominee she puts forward.That means the Court will drag on with only eight Justices, which will result in more cases that result in 4-4 ties that fail to settle the law, which would give red states the power to have state laws that conflict with our Constitution. Essentially, it s a way to shift power to the states by default. And it would only shift more as other Supreme Court Justice die or retire. Once the Court bench dwindles too much, the Justices will have an even harder time keeping up with the case load, which means justice will be delayed.And this strategy could even affect lower courts as well. Without courts to keep them in check, conservatives could pass any laws they desire knowing that courts will be too backed up or are nonexistent to stop them, meaning more anti-gay laws, voter suppression laws, and anti-women laws will be enacted by red state legislatures with impunity.It s an impending constitutional crisis that Republicans are orchestrating.This a dangerous interpretation of the Constitution and it runs contrary to the established precedent that has been set since America s founding. No Senate has outright refused to hold confirmation votes on any nominees put forward by a sitting president. While the Senate has voted a handful of nominees down, they ve never blocked any and all nominees picked by a president no matter how divided the executive and legislative branches are politically.But that s exactly what Republicans are planning to do if Hillary Clinton wins and they get to keep control of the Senate, which means at least two more years until Americans can flip the Senate to more reasonable lawmakers. And it could actually end up being four more years of gridlock since the party that controls the White House often suffers midterm election losses.In short, the only thing that can prevent Republicans from letting the Supreme Court whither on the vine and die is the American people in this presidential election. Republicans must NOT be allowed to keep control of the Senate. The viability, functionality, and survival of our judicial institutions depends on Democrats taking back majority control of the Senate. If voters fail to do this, it could mean the end of the Supreme Court and justice in America.Featured Image: Win McNamee/Getty Images",0.0
Former President George W. Bush does not cast vote for president,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Former Republican President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, did not cast a vote for U.S. president on Tuesday but did vote for Republicans in down-ballot races, a spokesman for Bush said.

Hezbollah says Saudi Arabia forced Lebanese PM to quit,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon s Shi ite Hezbollah group on Sunday accused Saudi Arabia of forcing Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri to quit, and called for calm in an effort to contain the political crisis unleashed by his resignation. Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Iran-backed Hezbollah, said there should be no political escalation in response to Hariri s declaration on Saturday, which was made from Saudi Arabia and came as surprise even to his aides. Hariri, in a televised speech, said there was a plot to kill him, and accused Hezbollah and its Iranian backers of sowing strife in the Arab world.    Nasrallah said  legitimate questions  were being asked over whether Hariri had been detained in Saudi Arabia, where news emerged on Sunday that royals, ministers and investors had been arrested in an anti-corruption purge. Aides to Hariri, whose family made their fortune in the Saudi construction industry, strongly denied he had been detained or had been forced to resign. Speaking in a televised address, Nasrallah said:  The resignation was a Saudi decision dictated to Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri and was forced on him.  Nasrallah said Lebanon s political leaders expected Hariri to return to Lebanon on Thursday  if he is allowed  to travel.  Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, a political ally of Hariri, is locked in a bitter tussle for power across the Middle East with Shi ite Iran and its allies, including Hezbollah. Lebanese President Michel Aoun will not accept Hariri s resignation until he returns to Lebanon to explain his reasons, palace sources said on Sunday, delaying for now the politically difficult consultations over his successor.  Nasrallah said he would not comment on accusations leveled against Hezbollah by Hariri, describing his resignation announcement as a Saudi statement. Hariri s resignation toppled a coalition government that included Hezbollah, thrusting Lebanon back into the frontline of the Saudi-Iranian regional rivalry and risking an open-ended political crisis.  The government was formed late last year in a political deal that ended years of deadlock, and last month it produced Lebanon s first budget since 2005. Nasrallah said he had thought things were going well and had not wanted Hariri to quit.  Hariri allies in Lebanon have denied suggestions he had been detained and a photograph was published on his Twitter account showing him with Saudi Arabia s newly appointed ambassador to Lebanon, Walid al-Yaaqoub. News of high-level arrests in Saudi Arabia fueled social media speculation in Lebanon that Hariri, a Saudi national, was a target. Nasrallah said  there was legitimate concern , asking if Hariri had anything to do  with this internal struggle between the princes .    Saudi Oger, the construction firm owned by the Hariri family, has faced a multibillion-dollar debt restructuring. The company was hit by a decline in oil prices led to sharp state spending cuts in the kingdom.     Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq al-Awsat cited unnamed sources close to Hariri as speculating that he would probably remain outside Lebanon because of the security threat against him. Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh sought to calm fears the political turmoil would hit Lebanon s already fragile economy, issuing a statement to reaffirm the stability of its currency, which is pegged against the U.S. dollar.    In Lebanon s sectarian system the president must be a Maronite Catholic, the prime minister a Sunni and the speaker of parliament a Shi ite. Hariri is Lebanon s most influential Sunni politician. His father, Rafik al-Hariri, was prime minister after Lebanon s 1975-1990 civil war and was assassinated in a car bombing in 2005.  A U.N.-backed tribunal has indicted five Hezbollah members for the killing but the group denies any involvement.  Saudi media have published reports of a plot to assassinate Hariri in recent days, but all of Lebanon s main security branches have said they have no information about such a plot. A Saudi minister said on Saturday that Hariri s personal security detail had  confirmed information  about the plot. Thamer al-Sabhan said in an interview with a Lebanese TV station on Saturday that there were  threats against the prime minister and the kingdom is keen for his security . U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was concerned by Hariri s resignation and hoped all sides in the country would back its state institutions, his spokesman on Lebanon Stephane Dujarric said in an emailed statement.

CHICAGO THUG PRESIDENT PERSONALLY LEAKED CHUCK SCHUMERS OPPOSITION TO HIS DANGEROUS IRAN DEAL,"Schumer asked the President not to mention his decision publicly until he could make a formal announcement on Friday.If that s how Obama treats his closest friends who refuse to align with his reckless Iran deal, just think how he treats his enemies President Obama personally leaked news that Senator Chuck Schumer had decided to oppose his Iran deal, even after Schumer personally asked the President not to mention it until he could make an announcement Friday.During last night s widely-viewed GOP debate, word began to circulate that Sen. Schumer had decided to oppose President Obama s nuclear deal with Iran. The leak appeared timed to make sure the high-level Democratic defection Schumer is the 3rd highest ranking Democrat in Congress got as little attention as possible.A story at Politico confirms the leak was in fact timed for minimum impact, but not by Schumer himself. According to an unnamed source familiar with Schumer s decision, the Senator called President Obama Thursday afternoon to say he had decided to oppose the deal. Schumer asked the President not to mention his decision publicly until he could make a formal announcement on Friday. Politico s source was careful to emphasize that Schumer told no one else about his decision, meaning only President Obama himself could have made the decision to leak the story to the press.After word leaked out, Sen. Schumer issued a lengthy statement about his opposition to the deal on his website. The statement breaks his opposition into three parts. He writes that he finds the arguments for the deal over the first 10-years  plausible  but says the inspections regime has  serious weaknesses  and that the snap back of sanctions process is  cumbersome.  In addition, Schumer believes that after 10-years Iran will have a nuclear program approved by the United States. Finally, Schumer considers the non-nuclear parts of the deal and concludes,  When it comes to the non-nuclear aspects of the deal, I think there is a strong case that we are better off without an agreement than with one. Congress is expected to vote against the deal when they return from the August recess. However, that decision can be vetoed by the President. Congress needs a 2/3 vote to override that expected veto. That means the President needs just 34 Senators to take his side. So far he has at least twelve.But as a high ranking Democrat in line to become the next Senate leader of his party, Schumer s defection has the potential to weaken the resolve of other Democrats. Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY) announced his opposition to the deal last night, shortly after word of Schumer s decision broke. For this reason, the White House had urged Schumer to avoid announcing his decision until the very end of the process, or at least after enough Senators had declared themselves to make it a non-issue.The spin coming out of the White House now is that Schumer s defection is a clear signal that a win for their side is inevitable. The thinking goes that an insider like Schumer wouldn t really put Obama s foreign policy legacy at risk, therefore his planned Friday announcement must be a signal that the votes are there to prevent a veto override vote without him. As Politico frames it,  Bad news is being taken as almost good news at the White House. Contradicting this claim is the fact that the White House seemed to be expressing some anger at Schumer earlier in the day. White House spokesman Josh Earnest suggested Friday that Schumer s defection could become an obstacle to his becoming Democratic leader after Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) leaves the Senate. Other White House surrogates made similar noises.Via: Breitbart News",0.0
OBAMAS RADICAL DHS Chief Vows To Protect Muslims From Americans During Speech At DC Mosque,"The Muslims faith must be protected at all costs it s the Obama way During a news briefing delivered at the All Dulles Area Muslim Society mosque in Washington, D.C., following the San Bernardino shooting, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson vowed to  protect  Muslims from the same sort of  fear, suspicions and prejudice  that haunted suspected communists during the era of McCarthyism.And in making this vow, Johnson specifically pointed to his grandfather, reported the government watchdog group Judicial Watch, whose members managed to observe the briefing despite the mosque s leaders attempting to kick them out. In 1949, during the McCarthy era, my own grandfather was called upon to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee, to deny he was a member of the Communist Party and defend the patriotism of African-Americans,  Johnson said.  Today his grandson is responsible for the homeland security of this entire nation. Johnson sees a connection between the actions of deceased Sen. Joseph McCarthy, who used unsubstantiated accusations of communism to target anyone who dared criticize either him or the federal government, and the burgeoning movement to clamp down on radical Islamic terrorism. As Muslim terrorism hits closer and closer to home, our Homeland Security chief views the war on Islamic terrorism as a another Red scare, where Muslim terrorist suspects are Red-baited like his grandfather,  the editorial board for Investor s Business Daily wrote regarding this revelation.  No wonder this administration isn t interested in monitoring radical Muslims for terrorist connections. The irony seems thick, given that the only ones behaving like McCarthy have been President Barack Obama and his cronies, including Johnson, all of whom use disingenuous labels like Islamophobe and bigot to shut down anyone who dares speak critically about Islam or point out its obvious ties to radical terrorism.

China lodges protest after Trump call with Taiwan president,"BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China lodged a diplomatic protest on Saturday after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump spoke by phone with President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, but blamed the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its own for the petty move. The 10-minute telephone call with Taiwans leadership was the first by a U.S. president-elect or president since President Jimmy Carter switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, acknowledging Taiwan as part of one China. Chinas Foreign Ministry said it had lodged stern representations with what it called the relevant U.S. side, urging the careful handling of the Taiwan issue to avoid any unnecessary disturbances in ties. The one China principle is the political basis of the China-U.S. relationship, it said. The wording implied the protest had gone to the Trump camp, but the ministry provided no explanation. Speaking earlier, hours after Fridays telephone call, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi pointedly blamed Taiwan for the exchange, rather than Trump, a billionaire businessman with little foreign policy experience.  This is just the Taiwan side engaging in a petty action, and cannot change the one China structure already formed by the international community, Wang said at an academic forum in Beijing, Chinas Foreign Ministry quoted him as saying. I believe that it wont change the longstanding one China policy of the United States government. In comments at the same forum, Wang noted how quickly President Xi Jinping and Trump had spoken by telephone after Trumps victory, and that Trump had praised China as a great country.  Wang said that exchange had sent a very positive signal about the future development of Sino-U.S. relations, according to the ministrys website. Taiwan was not mentioned in that call, according to an official Chinese transcript. Chinas Taiwan Affairs Office also called the conversation a petty move by Taiwan that does not change the islands status as part of China. Beijing is resolute in opposing independence for Taiwan, it added. Trump said on Twitter that Tsai had initiated the call he had with the Taiwan president. The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you! he said. Alex Huang, a spokesman for Tsai, said: Of course both sides agreed ahead of time before making contact. Trump and Tsai noted that close economic, political and security ties exist between Taiwan and the United States, the Trump transition team said in a statement. Taiwans presidential office said the two discussed strengthening bilateral interactions and establishing closer cooperation. China considers Taiwan a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control. Relations between the two sides have worsened since Tsai, who heads the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, was elected president in January. Chinese state media downplayed the possibility of a major blow-up in Beijings relations with Washington as Trump prepares to assume office. Influential state-run tabloid the Global Times said in an online editorial that if Trump really overturned the one China principle upon assuming office it would create such a crisis with China hed have little time to do anything else. We believe this is not something the shrewd Trump wants to do. Chinas official Xinhua news agency said Trump needed to know Beijing can be a cooperative partner as long as Washington respects Chinas core interests, including the issue of Taiwan. China and the United States are not destined rivals, it said in an English-language commentary. Washington remains Taiwans most important political ally and sole arms supplier, despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties, the irony of which was not lost on Trump. Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call, Trump said in another tweet. Trump has eschewed tradition in other calls with foreign leaders since he won the U.S. election, prompting the White House to encourage him to make use of the diplomatic expertise and counsel of the State Department.  Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said on CNN that Trump was well aware of what U.S. policy has been on Taiwan. Administration officials said Trumps team did not alert the White House about the call ahead of time. The White House also said after Trumps call that longstanding policy on China and Taiwan had not changed. Advisers to the Republican president-elect have indicated that he is likely to take a more robust policy toward China than Obama, a Democrat, and that Trump plans to boost the U.S. military in part in response to Chinas increasing power in Asia. However, details of his plans remain scant. Trump lambasted China throughout the U.S. election campaign, drumming up headlines with pledges to slap 45 percent tariffs on imported Chinese goods and label the country a currency manipulator on his first day in office. Earlier this week, Trump spoke to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and praised him, according to the Pakistani leaders office, as a terrific guy. Islamabad and Washington have seen relations sour in recent years over U.S. accusations that Pakistan shelters Islamist militants who kill U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan, a charge denied by the South Asian nation. Trump also invited Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte to the White House next year during what a Duterte aide said was a very engaging, animated phone conversation. Duterte has openly insulted Obama, who canceled a planned meeting with him in September. A statement issued by Trumps transition team made no mention of the invitation. ",1.0
Could Newt Gingrich Save The Republican Party By Becoming Speaker Of The House?,"He d like to build a giant wall, deport illegals, defund Planned Parenthood and deal with our debt crisis. These are all issues Newt Gingrich believes need to be dealt with. Given his past history as Speaker, he may just be the guy to get the job done Newt Gingrich told Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alexander Marlow on Saturday that if he had the votes in congress to reclaim the Speaker of the House position, he would accept.Gingrich acknowledged that if he had 218 house members backing him as Speaker, who approved of his strategy on the continuing resolution, and his strategy on dealing with the debt ceiling, he would have a  moral obligation to serve the country. Gingrich, who served as Speaker in the 90 s during the Clinton Administration, initially made light of this provocative possibility by reminding listeners to Breitbart News Saturday on Sirius XM Patriot radio, channel 125, of the time when conservative icon William F. Buckley was asked while running for Mayor of New York: if he was elected, what would he do? Buckley said that the first thing he would do is demand a recount.Later in the interview, the consummate historian side of Gingrich emerged. He waxed more philosophical, relating that George Washington never sought elected office, but when called upon to serve, he did so.The architect of the  Contract with America  in 1994, which proposed ten policies the GOP promised to a vote on during the first hundred days of the new Congress, cautioned current house members to  slow down  when picking their next Speaker. Gingrich asserted that the House chamber must break down into lengthy conferences among themselves and vet candidates not on personality, but on their ability to articulate strategy.The former Speaker asserted that House leadership needs to have a sound strategy on how to deal with the continuing resolution that comes up in December and the debt ceiling.  Unless they have a strategy in dealing with these kind of issues, they will just rapidly undermine the next speaker and be right back in the middle of a bitter internal fight that they don t need,  he said.Marlow asked Gingrich his position on funding Planned Parenthood and the possibility of a government shutdown.  I would have a hard time voting for a bill that funded it,  he replied.  Even if it meant a shutdown?  inquired Marlow.  Let me repeat myself. I would have a very hard time voting for a bill that funded Planned Parenthood,  Gingrich replied.Gingrich said that Republicans have to make it clear that they are not defunding women s health.  Here is the money, we are not defunding women s health,  needs to be expressed. He recommends that congress apply the exact same dollars for women s health to other organizations, including religious groups, but not to be complicit in   a process that cuts up babies. We should say how can the president of the Unites States defend cutting up babies, and if Obama wants to close the government over his commitment to cutting up babies, then I would say let s have the fight. Regarding immigration, Gingrich told Marlow that he just came back from Israel.  You can t spend time in Israel and not believe that fences work. People who say you can t build a fence are just wrong,  he maintains. He added that Trump is right on this, and that building 95-story sky-scrapers is more complicated than building fences.The ten time re-elected congressman from Georgia stressed that there must be a strong e-verify network in place, but it would be implausible to round up and deport all who came across American borders illegally.  We are not going to deport 11 million people. We are not going to go into neighborhoods, we re not going to tear up churches, not going to tear up families. No American system could tolerate that level of personal and dehumanizing process. Gingrich does think, however, that America could aggressively deport criminals.  People in neighborhoods would be grateful that you got rid of the criminals,  he insisted.  MS13 Gang from El Salvador, which is now in 70 cities, should be utterly, totally unacceptable to every American. The conservative icon added that he finds that when he meets with legal immigrants across the nation, they are the  strongest supporters of insisting on legality. Because they paid their dues; they did the right things. They followed the law. They would like to see an America insisting on returning to that. Gingrich maintains there should be a  pathway to legality,  but rejects offering them citizenship before those  waiting patiently  who apply legally. There could be exceptions for some who would enter the military. If one is willing to  risk their lives  for America, extenuating circumstances may apply in that case, Gingrich believes.

BREAKING: A HUGE DEAL! Putin Suspends Nuclear Pact With US," The Obama administration has done everything in its power to destroy the atmosphere of trust which could have encouraged cooperation Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday suspended a treaty with Washington on cleaning up weapons-grade plutonium, signaling he is willing to use nuclear disarmament as a new bargaining chip in disputes with the United States over Ukraine and Syria.Starting in the last years of the Cold War, Russia and the United States signed a series of accords to reduce the size of their nuclear arsenals, agreements that have so far survived intact despite a souring of U.S.-Russian relations under Putin.But on Monday, Putin issued a decree suspending an agreement, concluded in 2000, which bound the two sides to dispose of surplus plutonium originally intended for use in nuclear weapons.The Kremlin said it was taking that action in response to unfriendly acts by Washington. It made the announcement shortly before Washington said it was suspending talks with Russia on trying to end the violence in Syria.The plutonium accord is not the cornerstone of post-Cold War U.S.-Russia disarmament, and the practical implications from the suspension will be limited. But the suspension, and the linkage to disagreements on other issues, carries powerful symbolism.Read more: Reuters",0.0
"France's Macron seeks renewal of Africa ties, but old problems persist","PARIS (Reuters) - Barely six months into office, President Emmanuel Macron is already preparing for his third visit to sub-Saharan Africa. Yet while the energetic young leader is eager to reshape France s relationship with the continent, old problems die hard. His Nov. 28-30 trip to Burkina Faso, Ghana and Ivory Coast is aimed at boosting cooperation on education, the digital economy and the environment. The visit will be capped by an EU-Africa summit in Abidjan, when migration will top the agenda.   Africa is not just the continent of migration and crises. It s a continent of the future,  the 39-year-old president told French ambassadors in August. But even then, French forces were being sucked deeper into a years-long battle to quell Islamist militancy in Mali. Last month, a raid by French special forces in the Malian desert illustrated how deep that quagmire is becoming. French troops stormed an Islamist training camp, killing 15 suspected militants. French officials said the operation was based on intelligence the camp housed Malians who had joined the Islamists. Mali said government soldiers held hostage by the Ansar al-Dine group were among the dead. As recriminations flew, a defense official spoke of  a real trust problem . Laurent Bigot, a former under-secretary in the French foreign ministry, was blunt:  Mali is a disaster,  he said.  We re repeating mistakes made in Iraq and Afghanistan.  That assessment underlines just how much work Macron faces if he is to strengthen security and migration policy without getting bogged down in costly military ventures. More than 7,000 French troops are already deployed across Africa.  Macron will make his first stop in Ougadougou, Burkina Faso, where he will set out his vision for Franco-African relations in his favored style - a speech. Language and tone are critical. French presidents usually make early visits to Africa, but some have misjudged. Nicolas Sarkozy declared  the tragedy of Africa is that the African has not fully entered into history . The comment has haunted him. A presidency official said Macron would emphasize education and investing in youth across the continent, themes he has touched on in his first six months in power.  In Ghana, a former British colony where France has ramped up investment, including in oil, telecoms and technology, Macron is to promote the digital economy and a broadening of French education initiatives.  In Ivory Coast, environment will be the main topic, before EU and African leaders meet to discuss security and migration, with both Macron and Germany s Angela Merkel keen to limit the flow of migrants to Europe by introducing tighter checks and controls on African soil, not in Europe.   Macron s proposals to bolster African growth and create jobs echo Germany s call for a  Marshall Plan for Africa . He also promises to raise France s aid budget from 0.38 percent of national income to 0.55 percent by 2022.    After French colonialism ended in the 1950s and 60s, France wielded a tight grip over its former dominions, using military might to install leaders in return for French companies securing lucrative contracts   a policy dubbed  Francafrique . But French diplomats say the days of France throwing its weight around for commercial favors are over.  Macron, born months after Djibouti became the last French colony to gain independence, has shown little inclination to revive the old networks that linked French businessmen and intelligence agents with African politicians.   We have a president who has never known the colonies and never had those close links to the region s leaders. He has more freedom to say what he thinks,  said one diplomat. Macron has created an African Presidential Council to help shape his thoughts. Its 11 members are mostly young, dual-national entrepreneurs with backgrounds in art, media, finance and ecology. It reports directly to the president, irking some in diplomatic circles.  France s shift away from Francafrique has eroded the privileges once enjoyed by companies such as Total, Orange and Areva, just as globalization has opened the field to China and India. French business group Medef is lobbying Macron for a greater role for the private sector in his vision for Africa, although some acknowledge French companies face huge competition and can still suffer an image problem.  Africa is a fast growing continent, business opportunities are not a problem,  said Patrice Fonlladosa, president of Veolia Africa & Middle East and head of Medef s Africa committee.  The problem is being chosen as the partner of choice.   ",1.0

 Supreme Court To Hear Major Wisconsin Gerrymandering Case,"In a case that could have far-reaching consequences on the outcome of future elections, the US Supreme Court agreed on Monday to rule on whether electoral maps that are deliberately drawn to favor a certain political party, a process also known as gerrymandering, are constitutionally acceptable.Last November, the state of Wisconsin appealed a lower court ruling that state Republican lawmakers violated the constitution when they created legislative districts that put Democrats at a disadvantage and now the Supreme Court is going to hear their case. The state s argument was that the recent Wisconsin election results favoring Republicans  is a reflection of Wisconsin s natural political geography  with Democrats concentrated in urban areas such as Milwaukee and Madison.A panel of federal judges in Madison ruled 2-1 that the state s Republican-led redrawing of legislative districts amounted to  an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander,  violating the US Constitution s guarantees of equal protection under the law and free speech by sabotaging Democratic voters  abilities to turn their votes into seats in Wisconsin s legislature.The Supreme Court has ruled state electoral maps invalid based on grounds of racial discrimination, such as it did with North Carolina on May 22, when the power of African-American voters was diminished statewide due to Republican legislators drawing two electoral districts. However, they ve been reluctant to throw out maps that give one party a distinct advantage over the other. Until now that is. Wisconsin s gerrymander was one of the most aggressive of the decade, locking in a large and implausibly stable majority for Republicans in what is otherwise a battleground state,  said redistricting expert Thomas Wolf of the Brennan Center.  It s a symptom of politics going haywire and something that we increasingly see when one party has sole control of the redistricting process. If the Supreme Court finds the state of Wisconsin at fault, it could affect congressional maps in about half a dozen states and legislative maps in about 10 states in the short term, but the long term effects are still unknown. State and federal legislative district boundaries are redrawn every decade to hold roughly the same number of people after each census, the next being in 2020.The original court ruling that the state is appealing ordered the redrawing of legislative boundaries to be in place by November 1, in time for the 2018 Wisconsin state election.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",0.0
U.S. believes current North Korea nuclear threat is manageable: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said on Thursday the Trump administration thinks the threat posed by North Korea s nuclear weapons capability is currently manageable but Pyongyang cannot be allowed to develop the ability to strike the U.S. homeland.  A state that has developed a pretty good ICBM (missile) capability and is developing a pretty good nuclear re-entry vehicle, I would believe ... that that state simply cannot have the ability to reach the homeland,  Kelly said.  Right now we think the threat is manageable but over time if it grows beyond where it is today, well, let s hope that diplomacy works,  said Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general. ",1.0
U.S. Transportation nominee Chao hits no roadblocks in confirmation hearing,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps choice to run the U.S. Transportation Department, Elaine Chao, defended the president-elects $1 trillion infrastructure plan as a bold vision on Wednesday in an overwhelmingly friendly Senate confirmation hearing. While there is criticism of Chao, in particular on environmental issues, there is no significant opposition to her nomination and she is expected to be confirmed.  She served as labor secretary under President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2009 and was the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position. She was deputy secretary of transportation under President George H. W. Bush. She was introduced by her husband, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The top-ranking Democrat on the committee, Floridas Bill Nelson, noted his wifes friendship with Chao. Chao will take a leading role in Trumps plans to rebuild crumbling U.S. roads and bridges with a $1 trillion fund. He would offer private investors who put money into projects an 82 percent tax credit but critics say it is unclear how they could recoup investments in most projects without sharply increasing costs for users of most roads and bridges. Chao described the plan to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation as a bold vision and acknowledged the need to work on the issue of paying investors back. For them (partnerships) to be truly effective, there need to be revenue streams that need to be assured, she added. We all know that the government doesnt have the resources to do it all.  Chao is nominated to head a department with such wide-ranging responsibilities as oversight of the nations airports and highways, fuel-economy rules for autos and probes into auto makers for safety recalls of key parts like airbags.  She declined to take positions on issues like whether the job of air traffic control should be privatized, concerns over the safety of shipments of crude oil by rail, foreign airlines like Norwegian Air Shuttles push to move into the U.S. market and regulation of developing technology like autonomous vehicles and drones. Chao faced no questions about her memberships on corporate boards. Chao is on the board of Wells Fargo & Co which has struggled since September after it agreed with regulators to pay $190 million in fines and restitution to settle charges that its employees wrongly created as many as 2 million accounts without customer authorization. Chao is an immigrant from Taiwan who arrived in the United States at age 8. Her father, James S.C. Chao, is founder of the Foremost Group, an international shipping company. ",1.0
Trump transgender decision 'shocking and ignorant': advocate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumps decision to ban transgender individuals from the U.S. military amounts to a shocking and ignorant attack on our military and on transgender troops, a leading advocate said on Wednesday.

KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom [VIDEO],"Former British Army officer, outspoken, conservative, radio and tv talk show host, Katie Hopkins warned Americans to fight back against the appeasement and political correctness in the United States of America.British conservative icon, Katie Hopkins gave a blistering speech about the dangers of political correctness and appeasement at the David Horowitz Restoration weekend in Palm Beach, Florida. Look at us, let us be a warning. Be better than us. I ve watched my country fall apart, and I want to warn others before they let their country do the same. And believe me, I love my country. Katie touched on many topics that most Americans are afraid to address. Hopkins reveals a horrifying story of a Muslim woman, who along with her boyfriend, was recently sentenced to prison, after a plot to behead Hopkins was uncovered. Hopkins also shares horrifying stories of multiple British citizens who have lost their lives, their limbs or suffer serious scars, as a result of acts of jihad against them by Muslim immigrants in their homeland of  Great Britain, after their nation welcomed them in with open arms. Do not allow America to fall as Europe has fallen, Hopkins told the crowd.Hopkins started out her speech with her usual biting and politically incorrect humor, by assuring the crowd she is not the outspoken, gay, conservative Milo Yiannopoulis. She then assured the audience that she was not gay simply because she wears her short. In fact, Hopkins calls herself a minority in London, because she s a white, married, mother of three, telling the audience that she s now on the  extinct list  in the UK.Hopkins tells of the time she spent in the migrant camps in Calais and tells horrifying stories of how the workers conform to the rule of Islam, so as not to offend the migrants they are taking care of. She tells a story of a mother who dresses her young daughter as a son, so the migrant men don t come into their tent to rape her daughter at night.  Hopkins admitted that she was  naive , and that she quickly realized,  Migrants don t come for a new life and leave their old life behind. They bring them with them. All the old conflicts from back home. The Eritreans hate the Somalis who hate the Afghanis who don t speak to the Libyans. And they re still fighting. They come, they do not start a new life, they bring their conflicts from back home. Watch Hopkins powerful speech here (some language may be offensive):",0.0
" F**ck Them All: Alec Baldwin Breaks Ranks, Goes To Bat For Kathy Griffin","This week, comedian Kathy Griffin s world got turned upside down over a photo in which she held up a bloody beheaded likeness of Donald Trump. Since then, Griffin has lost her longtime gig hosting CNN s New Year s Eve Special with her friend Anderson Cooper, been uninvited from an event with Senator Al Franken, and lost jobs in at least five venues. All over one miscalculation.She has faced criticism from both the left and the right, and people who have long considered themselves her friends and allies are distancing themselves from her so as not to get the stench of the public s rage all over them   likely at the urging of publicists who are wringing their hands behind the scenes. However, there is one person who is standing by Kathy Griffin: fellow actor and comedian Alec Baldwin. On Saturday, Baldwin went on an absolutely epic tweetstorm defending Griffin:Now, I am in no way condoning the depiction of a sitting president in such a way   even one who I loathe as much as Trump. Hell, I don t feel like Trump is any sort of president at all, and say so openly on a regular basis. The thing is, though, there s a double standard here. President Obama was regularly depicted with nooses and all sorts of vile, violent images during his eight years in office. Some of the people who participated in that are famous, too, such as Ted Nugent. To that end, why the backlash and career-ending furor for Kathy Griffin, but not for for Ted Nugent?And he is just one example. There have even been elected GOP representatives to participate in violent rhetoric regarding President Obama and former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Considering the job that they have, shouldn t they be held to a higher standard?In short, was what Griffin did way over the line? You bet. But should it end her career   especially when so many others have gotten away with way worse? Absolutely not. Alec Baldwin is right. Kathy Griffin made a mistake, she apologized for it, it s time to move on, folks.As for the cowardly employers and friends turning their backs on her   Baldwin is right. Fuck  em all. It s in one s time of need when one knows who her real friends are.Featured image via D Dipasupil/Getty Images",0.0
"AT&T chief executive, Trump meet amid planned Time Warner merger","NEW YORK (Reuters) - AT&T Inc (T.N) Chief Executive Randall Stephenson on Thursday met in New York with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, an opponent of  the companys acquisition of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N).  A spokeswoman for Trump confirmed the meeting after Stephenson was seen entering Trump Tower. Stephenson, who was accompanied by Robert Quinn, AT&Ts senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs, would not answer questions from reporters.  AT&T said later on Thursday that the companys $85.4 billion deal for Time Warner was not discussed. The conversation focused on how AT&T can work with the Trump administration to increase investment in the U.S., stimulate job creation in America, and make American companies more competitive globally, AT&T said in a statement.  During his campaign for the White House, Trump said AT&Ts proposal to buy Time Warner, owner of CNN and the Warner Bros movie studio, was an example of a power structure that was rigged against him and voters. Its too much concentration of power in the hands of too few, said Trump, who has repeatedly accused the media of being biased against him and his campaign. Since the election, Trump has not commented publicly on the AT&T-Time Warner deal, but he has been critical of CNN. He sparred with a CNN reporter on Wednesday during a televised news conference.  A person briefed on the matter said AT&T requested the meeting with Trump late last week.  As Thursdays meeting was about to get under way, Trump tweeted: @CNN is in a total meltdown with their FAKE NEWS because their ratings are tanking since election and their credibility will soon be gone. Representatives from AT&T and Time Warner declined to comment on Trumps tweet.  A Trump transition official told Reuters earlier this month that the president-elect still opposed the deal, which would require antitrust approval by the U.S. Department of Justice. It could also face a review by the Federal Communications Commission, although the companies are considering ways to structure the deal to avoid that.  Time Warner shareholders will meet on Feb. 15 to decide whether to approve the merger. ",1.0
#LAWSMATTER: Judge Serves Activist Lawyer Big Dose Of Justice After REFUSING To Remove Black Lives Matter Pin In Court [VIDEO],"It s good to know there are still some judges in America who put the law before political correctness An attorney was removed from court and taken into custody after a judge declared her in contempt for refusing to take off a Black Lives Matter pin.Youngstown Municipal Court Judge Robert Milich said Attorney Andrea Burton was in contempt of court for refusing to remove the pin in his courtroom as instructed. Burton was sentenced to five days in jail, but she has been released on a stay while an appeal is underway.Burton will stay out of jail during the appeals process as long as she obeys Milich s order not to wear items that make a political statement in court. If she loses her appeal, she will have to serve the five days in jail.Milich said his opinions have nothing to do with his decision. A judge doesn t support either side,  he said.  A judge is objective and tries to make sure everyone has an opportunity to have a fair hearing, and it was a situation where it was just in violation of the law,  he said.WATCH:The Youngstown branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) said its legal counsel is monitoring the case closely as it may violate Burton s civil rights.The judge said his ruling is based on Supreme Court case law in which a judge can prohibit symbolic political expression in courtrooms, even if it s not disruptive. There s a difference between a flag, a pin from your church or the Eagles and having a pin that s on a political issue,  Milich said.Legal analysts say judges have free reign when it comes to what s said, or worn, in their courtrooms.

 Wow: Did The Palins Lie About When Bristols Baby Was Born To Cover Up The Truth? (IMAGES),"Conspiracy theories aren t something I take seriously very often. The type of people who engage in conspiracy theories spend their time on Alex Jones  site talking about false flags and how mass shootings are a hoax. Fourteen years later, and they just can t admit that steel does in fact bend and melt and buildings fall down when you crash big planes into them.To be grouped with the crazies is inconceivable, but every so often something comes along that seems far-fetched   until you look closely. This particular theory is brought to you by the Blogspot Right Wing Crooks, who seem to have figured out how and why Bristol Palin s baby was born in November and not December like she claims.The entire story goes into great detail about individual Instagram, Facebook and Twitter posts, friends of the family and the supposed father and former fiance brought in to make it all neat and clean. In a nutshell, the theory is that Bristol Palin was impregnated in or around the time she was in Las Vegas last year complaining about  the night that ruined her life  a month before a Medal of Honor winner mysteriously appears to sweep her off her feet, propose and become an immediate fixture in all aspects of her public, private and online life.The timeline begins on Palin s Instagram on Valentines Day.  A selfie of her and an Alaskan prostitute adult industry worker dressed to impress for a night on the town appears with the caption  The night before the worst mistake of my life.  The picture is still there, but the caption, as reported by Right Wing Crooks, has been changed to #Vegas.If that was the night Bristol Palin was impregnated, a typical gestation period would bring her into early to mid-November for a due date. The fist picture of Bristol with her new daughter, Sailor, appeared on Christmas Eve:The Palins are notorious attention seekers. Up to this point, there was no mention of babies or deliveries or hospitals. All of a sudden, bam. There s Bristol, looking content with her daughter.Sarah hadn t posted at all either, but when she did there was a bit of a problem. When you post to Facebook your location is logged. Sarah Palin was somehow holding and loving on her brand new granddaughter in a Hospital in Parker, Alaska but posting to Facebook from New Orleans. Here is the actual post:https://www.facebook.com/sarahpalin/posts/10153836923483588Things got really fishy when a picture of Bristol and her little girl showed a piece of tape with an IV date on it. After enhancing, both Right Wing Crooks and Winning Democrats are convinced that the date most likely reads 11/4/15. November 4th, which by the Vegas pregnancy theory puts Sailor at exactly where she s supposed to be gestation-wise.Here are the pictures with enhancements:Right Wing CrooksThe theory is simple. To keep Bristol from looking like she got knocked up during a one night stand, a plan was formulated to move the birth. Bristol took pictures along the way, posting them a month or two in advance. If yopu check out her Instagram account, you ll see that at 32 weeks (according to her) pregnant she looked pretty along:32 weeks with my babe girl ?   A photo posted by Bristol Palin (@bsmp2) on Oct 29, 2015 at 10:36pm PDTThat from October 29th to this on Thanksgiving, an entire month later? And what s with the Christmas tree? It s almost like the whole thing is just staged:Happy Thanksgiving ? .. thankful for my babies  A photo posted by Bristol Palin (@bsmp2) on Nov 26, 2015 at 12:03pm PSTHow far-fetched is it really? You would simply have to consider what Sarah and the Palins would do to keep Bristol safe from the career (doing whatever it is she does) ending publicity of a one-night stand Vegas baby. Already her position as an abstinence counselor makes absolutely no sense, so that s kind of a wash, but with the Duggaresque hypocrisy of Bristol being a faith blogger on Patheos and possibly a future  where are they now  Dancing With The Stars special guest, the concept of changing a couple of months for a clean(er) slate may have been just that appealing.Did she fake the birth of her daughter nearly two months after it happened? According to Right Wing Crooks there are a slew of other tidbits that add to their theory:That is all admittedly very compelling stuff. It is also very circumstantial. If it turns out to be true it will go down as a not-so-well-planned scandal from America s first family of fools. If it s not true, well shame on the Palins for having an existence that makes it seem plausible.Featured image via Instagram",0.0

Poland's new prime minister: a gamble that could backfire,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland s new prime minister faces a difficult balancing act trying to repair bruised relations with the European Union without alienating the eurosceptic government s core voters. A Western-educated former banker who is fluent in German and English and was sworn in on Monday, Mateusz Morawiecki boasts the credentials needed to negotiate with Brussels. But any compromises to improve relations with Brussels, which sees the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party as a threat to democracy, would risk upsetting the traditional, Catholic supporters who propelled it into power two years ago. It is a gamble that could backfire, and it is not yet clear how far Morawiecki, 49, and his party, dominated by former Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski, are ready to go to please Brussels.   The idea to build up international credibility seems rational,  said Jaroslaw Flis, a sociologist at the Jagiellonian University.  But such actions would have to be in complete contrast with what Mateusz Morawiecki would have to do domestically to prevent the PiS from falling apart.  The PiS government has alienated many people at home and abroad with its nationalist rhetoric and changes to state institutions which the EU says subvert the bloc s laws. The European Commission, the EU executive, opened an inquiry into the rule of law in Poland in January 2016 and the European Parliament has started a process that could deprive Poland of its voting rights in the 28-nation bloc. Any hope in Brussels that Morawiecki s appointment signals a change of course by PiS will have been tempered by Polish parliament approving legal changes to the judiciary in defiance of the EU on Friday - the day after his nomination. The changes give parliament, where PiS has a majority, de facto control over the selection of judges. EU leaders looking for clues about Morawiecki s plans will also have taken little comfort from comments he has made since being nominated, making clear he backs a tough line on the EU and believes in PiS s traditional vision of the Polish state.   We want to transform Europe, this is my dream, to re-christianise it,  Morawiecki told the Catholic Radio Maryja broadcaster.  We want Poland to be strong, but also to contain ... Christian values. We will defend them against the background of laicisation and a deepening consumerism.  Asked by the radio interviewer about demands by French President Emmanuel Macron for Poland to face sanctions over a subversion of democratic rules, Morawiecki said he would not  bow down to blackmail.  In comments to parliament on Tuesday, Morawiecki suggested Poland might relent in a conflict with Brussels over logging in an ancient forest, which an EU court has said contravenes EU laws. But he said Poland s national interests came first in any debate over the future of the EU and that he  wholeheartedly  supported PiS s overhaul of the judiciary. Like Beata Szydlo, whom he replaced as prime minister, Morawiecki is likely to have to defer to PiS leader and co-founder Jaroslaw Kaczynski. Prime minister from July 2006 to November 2007, Kaczynski is widely seen as the power behind the party and Poland s main decision-maker. How much scope that will leave Morawiecki to carve out his own path remains to be seen. Former Polish President Lech Walesa, a PiS critic, has suggested that nothing of substance will change.  The circus has stayed the same, only the clowns have changed their roles,  Walesa, who led the Solidarity trade union movement that ended communist rule, said on Twitter.  The appointment of Morawiecki, whose father founded and led a radical offshoot of Solidarity in the 1980s, appears designed in part to present a new face of Poland to the EU. Szydlo, 54, at times responded angrily to EU criticism and relations with the bloc soured under her government. Underlining PiS opposition to Muslim immigration, she said last month Poland wanted to be sure Christian traditions were not subject to  ideological censorship  in the EU. Along with Hungary, Poland has refused to take in any of its quota of the wave of refugees from Syria and elsewhere who have come to Europe since 2015, on the grounds that Muslim immigrants are a threat to national security and stability.         Such comments appeal to core PiS voters, and Szydlo s government, which promised generous welfare payouts and a dedication to traditional Catholic values, was one of Poland s most popular since communist rule ended in 1989. A relative newcomer to politics, Morawiecki lacks Szydlo s broad appeal. But he has overseen significant economic achievements since becoming finance minister in 2016, a position he has retained in the new government. Tusk has welcomed what he sees as signs that Morawiecki is a liberal economist who wants better ties with the EU.  There is no doubt that (Morawiecki s) liberal bias and some pro-western gestures could be a sign that there is a lurking desire to improve relations,  Tusk said last week. But an economic stimulus plan Morawiecki unveiled in 2016 has been criticized by economists who say it depends heavily on private investment, which is low in Poland despite fast economic growth.  What Morawiecki sees as a solution, meaning more political influence in the economy, is actually dangerous,  said Leszek Balcerowicz, a former finance minister who coordinated the transition to a market economy after decades of communist rule. Any hint of protectionism is also likely to worry EU leaders, who seek to break down trade barriers.  Morawiecki has called the privatization of state-owned companies a tragedy and said he will give more power to domestic capital at the expense of foreign investors. In his comments to parliament on Tuesday, he said economic policy should not change.  ",1.0
"No breakthrough in Supreme Court dispute between Obama, Republicans","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican leaders of the Senate on Tuesday rebuffed President Barack Obamas appeal for hearings and a vote on his U.S. Supreme Court nominee during a face-to-face meeting that failed to budge them from their vow to block any nominee he offers. Obama, planning to name a replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia in the coming weeks, huddled with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley in the White House Oval Office for less than an hour. Senator Grassley and I made it clear that we dont intend to take up a nominee or to have a hearing, McConnell told reporters after the meeting. The meeting failed to produce any progress on how to proceed with finding a replacement for Scalia, a long-serving conservative justice who died on Feb. 13. McConnell and Grassley are insistent that Obama not pick a nominee and leave the decision to his successor, who takes office next January after the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Obama is insistent that it is the Republican-led Senates constitutional duty to act on his nominee. They made clear in their meeting with the president that theyre not going to change their mind just because the president says so, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said of the Republicans. Earnest said Obama still believes it was worthwhile to consult with the lawmakers before making his nomination. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said Obama stated during the meeting he would be willing to consider candidates for the Supreme Court proposed by the Republicans, but McConnell and Grassley offered no names. We killed a lot of time talking about basketball and other stuff, said Reid, who attended along with the Judiciary Committees top Democrat, Patrick Leahy. Under the Constitution, the president nominates Supreme Court justices and the Senate must confirm them. Without Scalia, the court has four conservative and four liberal justices, meaning any potential Obama nominee could tip the court to the left for the first time in decades. McConnell and Grassley have said allowing the next president to pick the new justice would let voters have a say in the selection when they elect a new president. Whether everybody in the meeting today wanted to admit it, we all know that considering a nomination in the middle of a heated presidential campaign is bad for the nominee, bad for the court, bad for the process and ultimately bad for the nation, Grassley said in a statement.

U.S. governors urge Trump to make insurance payments,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic and Republican U.S. governors on Wednesday urged the Trump administration, as well as Congress, to continue funding payments to health insurance companies that make Obamacare plans affordable, calling it critical to stabilizing the insurance marketplace.   Republican President Donald Trump, frustrated that Obamacare survived attempts to repeal it, has threatened to cut off about $8 billion in subsidies that help control costs for low-income Americans under the Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obamas signature domestic initiative. The Administration has the opportunity to stabilize the health insurance market across our nation and ensure that our residents can continue to access affordable health care coverage, said a statement by the Health and Human Services Committee of the National Governors Association. A first critical step ... is to fully fund CSRs (cost-sharing reduction payments) for the remainder of calendar year 2017 through 2018, the statement said, adding this was needed as Congress and the administration address long-term reform efforts. The committee is led by Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, and Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, a Republican. Earlier this year, the governors sent a letter calling on Congress to fully fund the cost-sharing payments. Some Congressional Republicans have joined Democrats in urging Trump to continue the payments. Republican Senator Lamar Alexander, chairman of the health committee, said Tuesday the president should pay the subsidies through September while lawmakers work on bipartisan legislation to fund the outlays for another year. But the Senates No. 2 Republican John Cornyn hesitated when asked Wednesday if he would support such legislation. Ive said before that Im not in favor of throwing money at insurance companies without reform, so thats going to be the nature of the conversation, Cornyn told reporters outside his office. Asked what reforms hed like to see, Cornyn mentioned the skinny Obamacare repeal bill the Senate voted down last week. Among other things, it would have repealed the requirement that every American have health insurance or pay a penalty. Insurers say that the cost-sharing payments are passed onto customers in the form of lower deductibles and co-pays that make care more affordable for low income Americans. Insurers are finalizing 2018 premium rates for the individual Obamacare market, with many saying their decision hinges on government guarantees for cost-sharing subsidies. Molina Healthcare Inc said on Wednesday it would stop selling Obamacare plans in Utah and Wisconsin, joining a slew of health insurers that have exited Obamacare markets amid uncertainty over the healthcare law. Anthem Inc, one of the largest sellers of these plans in 2017, has pared back offerings or mostly exited five states including California and may exit more.  White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told CNN the administration was still considering whether to end cost-sharing subsidies. ",1.0

 REPORT: Trump Considering Using National Guard To Hunt Down Undocumented Immigrants,"Donald Trump reportedly wants to use the National Guard as his deportation force.According to the Associated Press, a leaked memo written by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly revealed that Trump might call up 100,000 National Guard troops to  round up  undocumented immigrants.BREAKING: Trump administration considers mobilizing as many as 100,000 National Guard troops to round up unauthorized immigrants.  The Associated Press (@AP) February 17, 2017The plan would be an  unprecedented militarization of immigration enforcement as far north as Portland, Oregon, and as far east as New Orleans, Louisiana. The memo states that the National Guard would only be used if a state s governor approves, but seeing as how Trump has the power to call up any National Guard unit he wants, he could easily ignore the wishes of governors.Let s say California Governor Jerry Brown refuses to let Trump use the California National Guard to round up immigrants. Trump could just ignore him and call them up anyway just because Brown is a Democrat and Trump doesn t like to be told no.Meanwhile, Republican governors will probably have no problem unleashing the military against immigrants.White House mouthpiece Sean Spicer denied that such a memo exists.. @seanspicer tells @kwelkernbc immigration plan is  100%  false:  There is no effort to utilize the national guard to round up immigrants  Benjy Sarlin (@BenjySarlin) February 17, 2017And Assistant mouthpiece Michael Short also denied it.Not true. https://t.co/T8rA87kJaU  Michael C.

Ryan Parker (@TheRyanParker) February 17, 2017@BenjySarlin @seanspicer @kwelkernbc Yet AP says it has a memo written by John Kelly. This is when that credibility issue comes into play.  Chanty (@Chantelesque) February 17, 2017Donald Trump s effort to round up immigrants in this country is exactly the same as what Hitler did to the Jews. And you can bet Trump will have to order concentration camps be built because the government will have to house them somewhere while they await deportation.This action is absolutely un-American. It s cruel and a total affront to humanity. Donald Trump is not merely rounding up immigrants who have serious criminal records. He s treating all undocumented immigrants as criminals.It should also be noted that if Trump is allowed to use the National Guard for such an action, he could use the National Guard to do even more sinister things. And it could be American citizens who become the targets.Featured image via Andrew Harrer   Pool/Getty Images",0.0
HANNITY TEARS IT UP IN HIS BEST EVER RANT: Hillary Clinton and Her Husband Sold Out America to the Russians! [Video],"Sean Hannity was on fire with his opening comments on the Clinton-Uranium One deal bombshell last night. He ripped the Clintons and called on Trump s intelligence and law officials to investigate the scandal. It s a classic Hannity rant:  After President Trump won in November, President Obama and his administration   they were telling anyone who would listen,  Russia! Russia! Russia! Russia interfered with our election. Russia was creating a direct threat to American democracy  Hannity mocked.  Well if that s the case, why when they have mountains of evidence that we will reveal tonight of Russian bribery going back to 2009, why then would the Obama administration and Hillary in particular sign off on the sale of 20% of America s uranium to Vladimir Putin and the Russians? Tonight, with this new evidence, what we have discovered is that the evidence against the Clintons is overwhelming, it is incontrovertible,  Hannity continued.  Hillary Clinton and her husband sold out America to the Russians while millions of dollars flowed to their family foundation. And in the process, Clinton created a massive national security risk for every man, woman, and child   giving Vladimir Putin control over American uranium.

Sean told his audience that Circa News Sara Carter and The Hill s John Solomon have HUGE BREAKING NEWS. Hannity told his audience,  Let me put it this way, if I m Hillary or fake news, I won t be sleeping well tonight. Watch:.@seanhannity TICK TOCK Tonight Folks  Get ready @HillaryClinton  pic.twitter.com/PxbRCgyPwm  'GITMO' BAMA   (@President1Trump) October 17, 2017Well, John Solomon and Alison Spann s story did indeed break first thing today in The Hill, and it s a doozy. Will justice finally be delivered to these corrupt, anti-American, self-serving and lying players? Not providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them. The Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.    Former House Intelligence Chair Mike Rogers (R-MI)The Hill   Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account   backed by documents   indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted  with the consent of higher level officials  in Russia who  shared the proceeds  from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefitting Putin s commercial nuclear ambitions.The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America s uranium supply.When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she  never intervened   on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter. In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program. The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,  a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.The Obama administration s decision to approve Rosatom s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.That s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI, in fact, had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee s decision that Vadim Mikerin   the main Russian overseeing Putin s nuclear expansion inside the United States   was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.Then-Attorney General Eric Holder was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn t comment.Mikerin was a director of Rosatom s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin  did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons   to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,  a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show. The investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.On August 6, 2017,  The Washington Times questioned Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein s  fishing expedition  aimed at digging up dirt on President Trump in his investigation in the Trump-Russia investigation. The special counsel is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Justice, and we don t engage in fishing expeditions,  Mr. Rosenstein said on  Fox News Sunday. In his first Sunday show interview, Mr. Rosenstein added that special counsel Robert Mueller  understands and I understand the specific scope of the investigation and so, it s not a fishing expedition. Mr. Rosenstein s comments come amid reports citing unnamed sources that the investigation has expanded into Mr. Trump s finances unrelated to possible Russian interference in last year s election.Mr. Rosenstein played down the reports:  That s not anything that I ve said. That s not anything Director Mueller has said. We don t know who s saying it or how credible those sources are. Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven collusion between Russia and Donald Trump s campaign during the 2016 election.McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI.The connections to the current Russia case are many. The Mikerin probe began in 2009 when Robert Mueller, now the special counsel in charge of the Trump case, was still FBI director. And it ended in late 2015 under the direction of then-FBI Director James Comey, who Trump fired earlier this year.Bringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency s cap.But the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.The only public statement occurred an entire year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015, just days before Labor Day. The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.The lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.On Dec. 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin,  a former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison  and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.Ronald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told The Hill he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged. I had no idea this case was being conducted,  a surprised Hosko said in an interview.Meanwhile, Julian Assange is jumping on the bandwagon, as he teases that he has a major announcement of his own that is coming soon Russian nuclear bribery investigation reveals that Russia routed millions to the Clintons https://t.co/ti7ycn7auf  Julian Assange   (@JulianAssange) October 17, 2017",0.0
"CEOs of Target, ADM offer differing views on U.S. border tax at hearing","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief executive officers of two major American companies - retailer Target Corp and agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland Co - offered opposing views in a hearing before U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday on a proposed border adjustment tax. Target CEO Brian Cornell has been one of the most vocal opponents of the Republican-backed border adjustment tax and testified alongside Juan Luciano, president and CEO of ADM, who spoke in favor of the proposal. The border tax would imposes a tax on imports while providing a credit for exports and has been proposed by House Republicans as part of a larger tax code overhaul. Target is a big importer of goods, while ADM exports. House Speaker Paul Ryan argues the proposed border tax, which is estimated to garner $1 trillion, will not affect prices and will allow rate cuts for businesses while not creating deficits, but retailers warn that it could raise consumer prices as much as 15 percent.  Cornell and Luciano took staunchly different positions on the tax.  Under the new border adjustment tax, American families  your constituents  would pay more so many multinational corporations can pay even less, Cornell told the committee.  Luciano, on the other hand, argued that the tax would make American companies more competitive. A competitive tax code will help us continue providing American-made food and feed to our customers in the United States and abroad in the face of robust and, from a tax perspective, ever strengthening competition from abroad, he said. The outlook for passage of the border tax - which drew staunch opposition from retailers - remains perilous, especially as key Senate Republicans and President Donald Trump have refused to endorse it. Several Republican members of the committee expressed concerns about the tax during the hearing that stretched more than three hours, including Republican Representative Jim Renacci who argued the proposal could hurt small businesses that rely on imports. Dimming the prospects more, lawmakers and lobbyists have begun to speculate that Congress will be unable to rally support for a sweeping tax code overhaul this year, and are beginning to look instead at cutting tax rates without broad reform. The committee heard from two additional supporters of the tax, including William Simon, the former CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc, who despite his past with a large retailer that opposes the tax, endorsed the measure. We will see more good middle class jobs, a robust U.S. economy and an era of growth that will be led by a new industrial revolution, Simon said. Lawrence Lindsey, the former director of the National Economic Council under President George W. Bush, also supported the tax. Economist Kimberly Clausing, of Reed College, criticized the proposal, saying she disagrees with the argument by proponents that currency markets would prevent consumer prices from increasing.  This is an untested tax reform that is not ready for primetime, she said.  ",1.0

New Jersey Governor Christie outlines 2017 'fiscal restraint' budget,"TRENTON, N.J. (Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie proposed a $34.8 billion fiscal 2017 state budget on Tuesday that relies on a modest 3.1 percent revenue growth and no tax hikes. It was Christies first major address to New Jerseyans since he returned home after ending his run for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination last week. He thanked residents for that great privilege. While the result was not what I had hoped for, and maybe some of you too, the experience has made me a better governor, a better American and its made me a better person, he said.   Christie spent more than half of 2015 out of state, much of it campaigning, and in a Rutgers-Eagleton Poll on Tuesday just 29 percent of registered New Jersey voters had a favorable opinion of him, his lowest level yet. Gone from Christies address was the broad national tone that dominated so many of his recent speeches. Instead he spoke, albeit briefly, about the need to fund transportation projects, a key state issue. Christies spending plan, which he said was built on fiscal restraint, included $250 million in savings from yet-to-come cost reductions in health benefits for public employees. The cost cuts could come through required use of generic drugs and increased co-pays, examples from a Treasury briefing for reporters before Christies address to lawmakers in the statehouse. Christies budget could find favor with Wall Street credit rating agencies. Since he took office in January 2010, New Jersey has been hit with nine downgrades in part because of overly optimistic revenue projections and the use of non-recurring revenue sources. The governors latest spending plan addressed both issues, with estimated revenue growth of just 3.1 percent. The proposed plan overall is just 2.2 percent larger than the $34 billion of appropriations for fiscal 2016, which ends on June 30. It also slashes reliance on one-shot revenues, to 0.7 percent of the total budget from 2.9 percent this fiscal year. The states underfunded public pension system is another sore spot for rating agencies. The governor proposed a $1.86 billion contribution in 2017, the biggest amount ever for New Jersey, but still less than half of what the state should be contributing to keep the system healthy, according to actuaries. Democrats, who control the legislature, said Christie skirted real proposals for healthcare savings or transportation funding, which they have said could be paid for with a state gasoline tax hike.

Italy summons U.S. ambassador after reports U.S. spied on Berlusconi,"ROME (Reuters) - Italys foreign ministry summoned the U.S. ambassador on Tuesday after media reports that American intelligence services tapped the telephones of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and his aides in 2011. Newspaper La Repubblica reported the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) spied on the billionaire, four-time prime minister five years ago when his government was under pressure at the height of the euro zone debt crisis. La Repubblica said whistleblowing site WikiLeaks showed the 79-year-old media tycoon and head of Italys main center-right party had been in the NSAs crosshairs between 2008 and 2011. Ambassador John Phillips met the director general of the foreign ministry, Michele Valensise, in the afternoon. Afterwards the ministry issued a statement saying that Italy had called for specific clarifications about what emerged in relation to the events of 2011. Phillips assured us that he will immediately refer the question to his superiors, the ministry said. During the meeting, Phillips also pointed out that President Barack Obama banned eavesdropping on the leaders of close friends and allies of the United States in 2014, the statement said. Obama made that decision in part to smooth over frayed relations between the United States and Germany after reports surfaced in 2013 that the NSA had monitored the cellphone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Though Berlusconis influence has waned since he left government, he is still a prominent figure and leads Forza Italia, the second-largest party on the fragmented right wing of Italian politics.  Jewels in the crown of his business empire include TV company Mediaset and a majority stake in football team AC Milan.  Germanys federal prosecutor opened an investigation into the alleged tapping of Merkels mobile phone by the NSA but closed it after a year in June 2015, saying there was a lack of evidence that would stand up in court. Staunch Berlusconi ally and Forza Italia member Renato Brunetta said there had been a conspiracy to bring down Berlusconi, and warned current Prime Minister Matteo Renzi not to take the allegations too calmly.  Lets not forget how the ratings agencies downgraded Italy for no reason other than to push Berlusconi out, Brunetta said on Twitter. In the past, Berlusconi has repeatedly accused European Union officials of a plot to force him out of government. Berlusconi resigned in November 2011 and was replaced by former European Commissioner Mario Monti. A book by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner released in Italy in 2014 suggested EU officials had approached the United States with a project to force Berlusconi to step down. ",1.0
Half of Republicans would reject election result if Clinton wins: Reuters/Ipsos,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump has repeatedly called this years presidential election rigged and has coyly said I will keep you in suspense on whether he would accept a Hillary Clinton victory, but many Republicans are less circumspect, according to a new poll. Only half of Republicans would accept Clinton, the Democratic nominee, as their president. And if she wins, nearly 70 percent said it would be because of illegal voting or vote rigging, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday. Conversely, seven out of 10 Democrats said they would accept a Trump victory and less than 50 percent would attribute it to illegal voting or vote rigging, the poll showed. The findings come after repeated statements by Trump that the media and the political establishment have rigged the election against him. He also has made a number of statements encouraging his supporters to fan out on Election Day to stop ineligible voters from casting ballots. The U.S. government has accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations and state election systems. Clinton has said she will accept the results of the election no matter the outcome. The poll showed there is broad concern across the political spectrum about voting issues such as ineligible voters casting ballots, voter suppression, and the actual vote count, but Republicans feel that concern more acutely. For example, nearly eight out of 10 Republicans are concerned about the accuracy of the final vote count. And though generally they believe they will be able to cast their ballot, only six out of 10 are confident their vote will be counted accurately. Among Democrats, about six out of 10 are concerned about the vote count. They, too, believe they wi1l be able to cast their ballot, but eight out of 10 are confident their vote will be counted accurately. Republicans are just more worried about everything than Democrats, said Lonna Atkeson, a professor at the University of New Mexico and head of the Center for the Study of Voting, Elections, and Democracy. Additionally, seven out of 10 Republicans are concerned about issues such as vote buying, faulty voting machines, or confusing ballot designs. Six out of 10 Democrats feel the same way. Nearly eight out of 10 Republicans are concerned that ineligible voters, including non-citizens, will illegally cast ballots. Four out of 10 Democrats feel the same way. Six out of 10 respondents, regardless of party, say they are concerned about issues such as voter intimidation and suppression.  Atkeson said the level of concern and mistrust in the system, especially among Republicans, is unprecedented. Ive never seen an election like this. Not in my lifetime. Certainly not in modern history. The difference, she said, is Trump. It has to be the candidate effect.  She worries that the lack of trust is dangerous. It is one thing to not trust government, but quite another to doubt the election process. Then the entire premise of democracy comes into question, she said. About one in five Democrats said they would protest if their candidate loses. Slightly fewer Republicans said they would do the same. Fewer than one in 10 Democrats said they are prepared to take up arms in opposition compared to fewer than one in 20 Republicans. Democrats are also are three times as likely to say they would leave the country. There is one area where there is little disagreement:Most people do not expect the losing candidate to concede the race gracefully.  The poll surveyed 1,192 American adults online from Oct. 17 to 21. The results have a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points. The credibility interval for Democrats is 5.1 percentage points; for Republicans it is 5.5 points.

 Trump Doesnt Want His Supporters To Know His REAL Stance On Gun-Free Zones,"Donald Trump recently went after the gun nut vote in a hard way when he declared during the National Rifle Association s annual meeting on Friday that he, as president, would get rid of  gun-free zones.  Of course, Trump didn t mention during his pandering that many of the properties that he owns could be described as gun-free zones. He also just backtracked on the issue to a large degree, days after the meeting.An official with the Trump Organization told ABC News that there are  no restrictions on licensed individuals carrying in our hotels or golf clubs. That statement turns out to be completely false. Here is a rundown of properties that ABC News discovered that do, in fact, have restrictions on carrying guns. Mar-a-Lago, Trump s posh Florida club, doesn t allow guns, a hotel staff member told ABC News.Trump National Doral, in Miami, Florida, doesn t allow guns either, a security official told ABC News. The resort would  much rather not  have guns on the property, said a security official with the hotel, who noted that guns are  not to be carried on our property. We ve had guests that have brought them before,  he said, but those guns  had to remain in their safe the whole time in the room. A security worker at Trump National in Jupiter, Florida, said  no  when asked if guns were allowed on premises by citizens who are licensed to carry them. Asked about exceptions for people like off-duty cops, the staff member directed ABC News to a supervisor, who said the hotel had no comment at all on guns at the property.Trump International Golf Club in Palm Beach County, Florida, also doesn t allow citizens with concealed carry licenses to bring their guns on the property, a golf-shop worker told ABC News. Now, of course, these policies make sense. Who would want to go to a resort or golf club to relax only to be surrounded by insecure people carrying around firearms? The same could be said for any establishment. Why should the staff or patrons at a restaurant or retail store have to deal with the person who just walked in carrying an assault weapon?So, once again we find a clear disconnect between what Trump says and reality. Maybe Trump just wants to ban all gun free zones except those that are enacted on premises that primarily serve the wealthy? As he has recently stated in another attempt to pander to the  the second amendment is the only amendment that matters  crowd, Trump stated that he thinks that teachers should be able to carry firearms on school premises.Except that, since he Trump, he can t even seem to make up his mind on that matter. On Sunday, Trump was questioned about his stance on letting teachers carry firearms during an interview on Fox & Friends. That s where he stated that: I don t want to have guns in classrooms. Although, in some cases, teachers should have guns in classrooms. That means absolutely nothing and is a far cry from what he was preaching just a few days ago and his pledge he made in January when he said: I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools   you have to   and on military bases. My first day, it gets signed, OK? My first day. There s no more gun-free zones. Trump appears to be willing to spout any NRA talking point in an attempt to pander to anyone willing to be pandered to.  In some cases  does not in any way mean a blanket throwaway policy like he has been describing for most of his campaign. Instead, he now offers this ambivalent stance on a topic that impacts millions of lives.Featured image from (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)",0.0
Trump's defense chief on intelligence uproar: 'I'm not worried',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said he had no concerns about the Trump administrations handling of classified information and added the issue had not come up in his talks on Tuesday with several U.S. allies, saying: No, Im not worried. But at the same time, Mattis deferred to the White House and acknowledged he knew little more about the uproar than what he had read in the newspaper. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have previously said Trump discussed intelligence about Islamic State with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak at last Wednesdays talks in the Oval Office.

House Republicans pursue short-term government funding bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have decided to pursue a short-term measure to keep the government funded at current levels until March in order to give incoming President-elect Donald Trump more of a say on budget and appropriations issues, lawmakers said on Thursday. The decision, which surfaced as House Republicans prepared to meet Vice President-elect Mike Pence, calls for replacing a funding measure that expires on Dec. 9 with a similar resolution that would run through March 31. Lawmakers said the short-term measure would allow Trump to have greater input on setting funding priorities for the remainder of fiscal year 2017, which ends on Sept 30. I think the new, incoming government would like to have a say-so on how spending is allocated, House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters. And so we are working with ... the new Trump administration on the timing of that on the continuing resolution. Democrats and some Republicans described the decision as a mistake that could lead to a more difficult appropriations task next year. Representative Hal Rogers, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, expressed disappointment at the decision, which suspends months of work by lawmakers and their staffs on full-scale appropriations bills Congress had intended to enact before year end. I am extremely hopeful that the new Congress and the new administration will finish these bills, Rogers said in a statement, adding that his panel would immediately begin working on the new measure, known as a continuing resolution. Representative Charlie Dent, a Republican member of Rogers committee, called the decision a mistake following an election in which Democrats were able to increase their Senate minority.  It will be harder to pass an omnibus in March, Dent said. And well have a smaller margin in the senate to help us. Id rather clear the decks for a new administration. But apparently the new administration would like to be able to put their imprint on this. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said the continuing resolution would only perpetuate uncertainty about government funding.  Theyre making a big mistake for themselves. Theyre going to have a kettle of fish in March that they cant even imagine, she said. Some conservative House Republicans have sought a continuing resolution that would expire at the same time as the legislative limit on the government debt. ",1.0

 Patton Oswalt To Bernie Fans: Youre A F*cking Child If You Skip Voting Out Of Hatred For Hillary (TWEET),"Comedian Patton Oswalt has a knack for calling conservatives out on their bullsh*t and coming up with the most perfect responses to their nonsense.In the past, Oswalt has made it perfectly clear that he really, REALLY hates Donald Trump when he dedicated this hilarious poem to the Republican frontrunner on  National Poetry Day.   He s also been one of the more outspoken celebrities when it comes to opposing the GOP s hateful rhetoric (just look what he did when the GOP attacked Planned Parenthood). Now, the comedian is sending a special message to voters, urging them to act in the best interest of America by making sure that none of the Republican party s clowns are able to get into the White House.In an interview with the Huffington Post, Oswalt touched on the 2016 election while promoting his stand-up special Talking for Clapping,which premieres on Netflix on Friday. Although Oswalt has been a supporter of Bernie Sanders, he took the opportunity to clarify that he s not  Bernie or bust.  In fact, he wanted to encourage all of his fellow Bernie supporters to adopt the same attitude, for a very special reason. He said: I will vote for whoever the Democrats nominate against either of those two psychopaths. I think they re both equally dangerous and backward-facing for this country. When he was asked what he d say to a Bernie fan who would rather stay home and not participate in the election than give Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton their vote in the November general election, Oswalt had some harsh words: Well, then you re a fucking child. Well said. This is the same exact attitude Oswalt has taken to his over 2.6 million Twitter followers, urging them to unite for the Democratic party instead of divide.TwitterThe truth of the matter is that America cannot afford to have either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz as our next commander-in-chief, and the stakes are too high for us to lose millions of votes because people are upset their favorite Democrat didn t become the nominee. Every vote for the Democrats   regardless of the candidate   will help keep America safe from the disastrous GOP. Featured image via Andreas Rentz / Getty Images",0.0
Ex-CIA head says Trump remarks on Russia interference 'disgraceful',"ASPEN, Colo. (Reuters) - Former CIA director John Brennan on Friday criticized as disgraceful President Donald Trumps efforts to play down U.S. intelligence agencies assessment that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election. Trumps administration has been dogged by investigations into allegations of Russian interference in last years U.S. presidential election and possible ties with his campaign team. Speaking one day before his first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hamburg earlier this month, Trump said he suspected Russian interference in the election but that no one knows for sure. These types of comments are just disgraceful ... and the person who said them should be ashamed of himself, said Brennan, CIA chief under former President Barack Obama, at the Aspen Security Forum. Special Counsel Robert Mueller and several U.S. congressional committees are investigating whether Russia interfered in the election and colluded with Trumps campaign to try to swing the race in his favor over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.  Those probes are focused almost exclusively on Moscows actions, lawmakers and intelligence officials have said, and no evidence has surfaced publicly implicating other countries. Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump has said that  his campaign did not collude with Russia. Brennan said he was disappointed by the presidents handling of security issues in his first six months in office. I must say there are disappointments that I see in terms of what Mr. Trump is doing on the international stage that I think pose serious questions about how he is keeping safe our national security, Brennan said. Speaking at the same event in Aspen, James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence under Obama, was also critical of Trumps administration. Asked if Jared Kushner, Trumps son-in-law and top adviser, should have his security clearance canceled for initially failing to list on a disclosure form contacts he had with Russians, Clapper said it should be suspended pending a review. I do think the appropriate thing here is take a pause and at least suspend a clearance until youve had the opportunity to investigate and then decide whether the clearance should be restored or not, Clapper told the same panel. Brennan and Clapper also criticized Trumps remarks in a tweet earlier this year about U.S. spy agencies in which he accused them of practices reminiscent of Nazi Germany.  That (tweet) was a terrible insulting affront not to me or John. We get paid the big bucks to take that. But Im talking about the rank and file, the people in the trenches, men and women, the patriots in the intelligence community and that was completely inappropriate, said Clapper. ",1.0
 Frances President Confirms He Intentionally Humiliated Trump With That Handshake (VIDEO),"It was the cringe-inducing handshake seen   and mocked   around the world. Trump sat down with the new president of France, reached out his hand, and this was the result.What made the situation that much more awkward for Trump is that he has a well-known, albeit bizarre, habit of trying to humiliate others with his handshakes. Repeatedly, he has gone into a handshake with a foreign leader only to yank their arms and pull them in. He s a 70-year-old who cannot do a simple handshake without making everyone uncomfortable.Macron was reportedly warned ahead of time that Trump s handshakes were designed to be as awkward as possible. A Washington Post writer described the moment Macron s adviser was tipped off that an embarrassing incident was coming: Did you warn him about Trump s handshakes?  my philanthropist friend asked. A look of surprise popped on Araud s face as he inquired what exactly did that mean. Both of us told him about Trump s affinity for the alpha male, grab-and-pull power pump that always seemed to reduce the other person to a rag doll. Forewarned, Araud said he would alert Macron.So Macron came prepared. And the result was that the tables were completely turned on Trump.That was, according to Macron s own admission, by design. In a follow-up interview, Macron said he grasped onto Trump s hand with an iron grip with the intention of showing Trump he wasn t about to be made a fool of. My handshake with him, it wasn t innocent. He added:  One must show that you won t make small concessions, even symbolic ones, but also not over-publicise things, either. Macron s office confirmed the veracity of the president s comments in Le Journal du Dimanche.He described the handshake seen  round the world as a  moment of truth  for Trump. The Republican president had come to bully his European allies   instead they, to a person, stood up to him. The handshake was a symbol of that defiance.Macron might turn into the go-to guy for how to subvert Trump s outsized ego. In a later moment of pure trolling, he subtly put Trump in his place with this brutal greeting.

Tanzania charges officials with economic sabotage over seized diamonds,"DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzanian prosecutors charged two government officials on Friday with economic sabotage after they were accused of undervaluing an export-bound consignment of diamonds seized from a mine majority owned by London-listed Petra Diamonds. Archard Kalugendo, director of the state-run diamond and gemstone valuation unit, and government gemstone valuer Edward Rweyemamu were jointly charged with being responsible for $1.1 million of lost tax revenue. The court case is the latest twist in a government crackdown on the minerals industry this year, with President John Magufuli accusing the sector of not giving the government a fair share of Tanzania s mineral wealth.  Kalugendo, 49, and Rweyemamu, 50, are both employees of the Ministry of Energy and Minerals. They were not allowed to enter pleas at the Kisutu Resident Magistrate s court in Tanzania s commercial capital, Dar es Salaam. Lawyers said the two officials will enter their pleas when the case is transferred to the high court, which has jurisdiction to hear economic sabotage trials. The accused were denied bail and will be held on remand until the next hearing on Sept. 29. The pair face maximum jail terms of 20 years if found guilty. The diamonds were seized as they were being exported to Antwerp, Belgium, from Tanzania s main airport in Dar es Salaam on Aug. 31. Petra Diamonds said on Monday that it had halted operations at its Williamson mine after the government seized the diamonds and questioned some of its employees. Petra owns 75 percent of the mine, with the Tanzanian government holding the remaining shares. Petra has denied that it under-declares its diamond exports, saying that it follows all government laws and procedures in its business. The government said it will nationalize the diamonds, the value of which it puts at $29.5 million, twice the provisional value approved by the two government officials charged in court. The government has not disclosed how it came to its $29.5 million valuation.  Magufuli had ordered the examination of exports by individual companies after a parliamentary investigation found that the country s diamonds and other precious gemstone exports were under-declared. Mining accounts for about 4 percent of Tanzania s GDP. ",1.0
DENZEL WASHINGTON Tells Black Americans To Stop blaming the prison systemIt starts at home. It starts with how you raise your children,"This isn t going to go over well with Obama s Black Lives Matter folks Veteran actor Denzel Washington says his latest role as a dogged defense attorney in Roman J. Israel, Esq. reinforced his belief that black men  can t blame the system  because we make it  easy work  when it comes to filling America s prisons. It starts at the home. It starts at home. It starts with how you raise your children. If a young man doesn t have a father figure, he ll go find a father figure,  the Academy Award-winner told reporters at the Dan Gilroy-directed film s New York premiere, the New York Daily News reports. So you know I can t blame the system. It s unfortunate that we make such easy work for them,  Washington said.The 62-year-old Hollywood heavyweight told reporters that the subject of how fatherless young men fall into a life of crime and incarceration is a personal one. I grew up with guys who did decades (in prison), and it had as much to do with their fathers not being in their lives as it did to do with any system,  said Washington, whose character finds himself working in the overburdened Los Angeles criminal court system.  Now I was doing just as much as they were, but they went further. I just didn t get caught, but they kept going down that road and then they were in the hands of the system,  the actor added.  But it s about the formative years. You re not born a criminal.   Breitbart News This isn t the first time Washington pushed back on the  victim  narrative for black Americans. The self-proclaimed radical feminist Jenn M. Jackson wrote a hit piece on Denzel Washington in December 2016. In her article, Jackson expresses concern that Denzel  is a little less woke than all of us had hoped.  She even suggests that instead of being honest about his thoughts on racism, Washington would have been better off keeping his mouth shut. LOL! From Jackson s hit piece on Washington: In a recent interview with BET, Washington was asked if he thought colorism (the discrimination against people with darker skin tones) was holding back darker-skinned Black actresses in Hollywood. As BGLH reports, Washington was initially confused about what colorism was, asking the interviewer, Smriti Mundhra,  what does that mean? Moments later he said, One of the best roles for a woman of any color in the last, in a good good while or at least any movie that I ve been in, a dark-skinned woman has in this film. So as long as you re being lead by outside forces or just being reactionary then you won t move forward. You have to continue to get better. However, he goes on to add,  You can say,  Oh I didn t get the part because they gave it to the light-skinned girl, or you can work, and one day, it might take twenty years, and you can be Viola. He continues, The easiest thing to do is to blame someone else, the system. Yeah, well, there s a possibility, maybe, that you re not good enough, but it s easy to say it s someone else s fault. But there s a possibility that you re not ready and you can still blame it on someone else instead of getting ready. ",0.0
Former homeland secretary says FBI delayed notification of cyber hack,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told a congressional panel on Wednesday that there was a delay between the time the FBI first made contact with the Democratic National Committee about Russia hacking its servers and the time he was notified at the Department of Homeland Security.  Johnson, who served under President Barack Obama, was testifying about alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  The Department of Homeland Security issued warnings about hacking into voter registration databases, but Johnson said the notices did not get the attention he would have liked.  Johnson blamed the emergence of a 2005 tape, in which Donald Trump brags about sexually assaulting women, for distracting the American public at the time of the warnings.  Asked why the Obama administration did not do more to warn the public about the hacking, Johnson said, We were very concerned that we would not be perceived as taking sides in the election, injecting ourselves into a very heated campaign.

 Senator Asks DOJ To Step In After White Supremacists Vow To Engage In Poll Watching,"A senator from Pennsylvania is asking the Department of Justice to step in following widespread media reports of white supremacists who have vowed to engage in poll watching on election day to guard against voter fraud.Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) wrote a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, pleading for the DOJ to intervene. These plans to monitor the polls are little more than thinly veiled attempts to suppress and delegitimize the votes of predominantly minority citizens, inflected with innuendo that recalls dark times in our country s civil rights struggle,  Casey wrote.  These calls are more than wrong and irresponsible; if executed, they could be illegal. It has been reported that the National Socialist Movement elements of the Ku Klux Klan and the American Freedom Party are planning to send members to polls in Philadelphia, and elsewhere across the country. Their goal is to ensure that Donald Trump isn t cheated out of the presidency due to voter fraud and a  rigged  election.One alt-right website is even claiming that white supremacists will be handing out liquor and marijuana in the  ghetto  of Philadelphia to help make sure minorities don t make it to the polls to cast their ballots. It has also been reported that hidden cameras will be installed throughout the city to help monitor activities.Casey told the DOJ that appalling tactics such as these must not be permitted under any circumstances. We have come too far to allow a group of white nationalists to intimidate minority voters in Philadelphia or anywhere throughout the nation,  he wrote.Trump has worked his bigoted base into a frenzy over claims that the election is  rigged.  (It s not.) He has convinced his supporters that  voter fraud  is a viable threat, when in fact, it is virtually nonexistent. These poll watching activities aren t even remotely intended to protect our system of fair elections. The only purpose for white supremacists to come out in droves to guard the polls with guns is to intimidate minorities and prevent them from voting.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images",0.0
 Fact Checkers Clear Hillary Of Big Oil Bribes,"Among the slew of baseless attacks launched against Hillary Clinton this election cycle has been the accusation that she s in the pocket of Big Oil because she s taken gobs of money from them. It feeds nicely into the  Hillary is a corporate shill and totally evil  narrative and is now currently gospel among anti-Hillary voters.Too bad it s not true.After Clinton was confronted by a Greenpeace activist demanding she answer for her  ties  to the fossil fuel industry, Clinton uncharacteristically blew a gasket: I have money from people who work for fossil-fuel companies. I am so sick   I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me. This caught my attention because Clinton doesn t normally get that hostile. As a seasoned politician, she s not prone to outbursts. But, as it turns out, she had good reason to be frustrated:According to the Center for Responsive Politics, as of March 21, the Clinton campaign has received nearly $308,000 for individuals in the oil and gas industry. The Sanders campaign has received nearly $54,000.In [sic] you include contributions from outside groups supporting a candidate, Clinton s total increases slightly to $333,000, compared to Sanders  $54,000.A $279,000 difference may sound like a lot to you and me buuuuuuuut .As our colleague Philip Bump noted, about 0.15 percent of Clinton s campaign and outside PAC money is from the  oil and gas industry,  compared to 0.04 percent of Sanders s contributions.Yes, you read that correctly: .15 percent. As in,  less than percent.  As in,  a little more than one tenth of one percent.  Now, you COULD still insist that $308,000 is a huge amount but you d still have to deal with that pesky fact that that money is from individuals that work in the industry, not the industry itself which, according to the Washington Post, has only given 2.3% of all the money it s donated this cycle to Democrats. Not just Clinton but ALL Democrats combined are part of that 2.3%.You know how some people say both parties are the same and in the pocket of Big Oil? Those people are idiots that should try living in the real world for a while.It s also been suggested by Greenpeace that any and all money donated to Clinton Super PACs is all from the fossil fuel industry if the lobbyist has a fossil fuel company as a client:Greenpeace counts all of the money raised or contributed by lobbyists as  oil/gas industry  funds, but these lobbyists have many other clients besides the oil industry. Ben Klein, one of the lobbyists highlighted in the Greenpeace report, also lobbies for American Airlines, Cigna, and Hearst, according to the lobbying disclosure database, so in theory his contributions to the Clinton campaign could also be labeled as funds for airline, insurance or media industry.It s a convenient fiction that, again, plays into the  Hillary is evil  narrative. And, again, this is now gospel to those who hate Clinton. But the fact checkers at the Washington Post say otherwise:The Sanders campaign is exaggerating the contributions that Clinton has received from the oil and gas industry. In the context of her overall campaign, the contributions are hardly significant. It s especially misleading to count all of the funds raised by lobbyists with multiple clients as money  given  by the fossil-fuel industry.This lands the  Hillary is in bed with Big Oil  story a whopping Three Pinocchios.In my opinion, the recent exaggerations and flat-out lies about Hillary Clinton stem from the fact that Republicans have spent 25 years and millions of dollar inventing scandal after scandal with nothing to show for it. None of the old stories have worked and despite Clinton supposedly being guilty of all kinds of crimes and corruption, no one can ever seem to prove anything. At all. This means that she is either the smartest criminal in the history of the world or that she s not the epitome of evil.We should probably leave lies and innuendo to Republicans. We re supposed to be better than this.Featured image via Washington Post",0.0
"I'm no populist, says new leader of Italy's 5-Star","RIMINI, Italy (Reuters) - The new leader of Italy s anti-establishment 5-Star movement says it is not a populist party and will make cutting waste and reducing debt its priority. 5-Star, which leads most opinion polls ahead of national elections due early next year, has been trying to shed its maverick, populist image and reassure foreign capitals that it can be trusted with power. Luigi Di Maio, the 31-year-old lawmaker picked on Saturday to lead the movement, told Reuters on Sunday that 5-Star stood for  post ideological  common sense, and was opposed to right-wing and left-wing extremism.  I reject populism as a label for 5-Star,  he said in an interview on the sidelines of the party s annual gathering in Rimini, on the Adriatic coast. 5-Star, founded by comedian Beppe Grillo nine years ago as a protest movement, bases its appeal mainly on opposition to corruption and vested interests. Boyish-looking and usually immaculately turned out in suit and tie, Di Maio presents a more moderate image than Grillo, who is famous for raucous tirades against the ruling elite. He had been groomed for the leadership by Grillo, who is 69 and now plans to withdraw gradually from his figurehead role. Di Maio said many of the party s proposals, such as a public bank to fund investments, had been adopted with success by mainstream parties in Northern Europe which he wanted to emulate. He said that, if 5-Star won next year s election, due by May, he would try to negotiate changes to European Union fiscal rules to allow Italy to invest more to boost its stagnant economy. However, he said he would also cut waste, arguing that this was the best way to bring down Italy s huge public debt, forecast to be just under 132 percent of GDP this year, the highest in the euro zone after Greece s.  We have brought down debt in every town and city where 5-Star governs. We will do that at the national level too,  he said. 5-Star has rowed back from a pledge to hold a referendum on Italy s membership of the euro and now says this would only be a last resort if the EU rejects any reforms to current budget rules. Di Maio, who comes from Italy s poor south and entered parliament at 26 five years ago, after mostly doing odd jobs and internet marketing, dismissed the suggestion that he was too inexperienced to be prime minister.  I came from a part of Italy with 60 percent youth unemployment, and people who sneer at my background are sneering at thousands of young Italians who are trying to create a future for themselves,  he said. The ability to build a competent team was the most important quality for a prime minister, Di Maio said, vowing to present a full cabinet line-up before the election. Asked to name three priorities that would mark his leadership of the party, Di Maio listed universal income support for the poor, cutting wasteful public spending and increasing forms of direct democracy.

 President Obama Hilariously Skewers Trumps Hateful Rhetoric In Thunderous Speech (VIDEO),"President Obama took aim at Donald Trump and his violent racist rhetoric on Saturday, and it makes us wish he could run for a third term. America is pretty darn great right now,  Obama thundered in Dallas in a direct rebuke of Trump s campaign claim that American has somehow gotten worse over the last eight years. America is making strides right now! America is better off than it was right now! The American people should be proud of what we have achieved together in the last eight years since the recession hit. We are great right now. Obama then went after Trump and the other GOP candidates for turning the election into a childish circus where lies reign over facts and violence against other Americans is encouraged, something that has led to multiple clashes between Trump supporters and protesters. What the folks who are running for office should be focused on is how we can make it even better   not insults and schoolyard taunts and manufacturing facts, not divisiveness along the lines of race and faith. Certainly not violence against other Americans or excluding them. We re a better country than that. Here s the video via YouTube.But President Obama was not done yet. As the crowd laughed, Obama turned Trump and his multiple business scams into a punchline. Imagine what Trump would say if he actually had a record like this instead of selling steaks,  Obama quipped. Has anybody bought that wine?  Obama asked the audience.  I want to know what that wine tastes like. I mean, come on, you know that s like some $5 wine. They slap a label on it, they charge you $50, saying this is the greatest wine ever. Come on! And then President Obama lambasted Republicans for saying how shocked they are over Trump s racist rhetoric, reminding them that their front-runner is the same guy who would not drop his obsession with Obama s birth certificate. Republicans didn t say anything then, Obama pointed out, because Trump s rhetoric was not aimed at the GOP like it is now.Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, the Republican Party and Fox News built the monster that is now taking over the party and invited white supremacists to take a prominent seat next to him.Trump s status as front-runner should be the end of the Republican Party as a legitimate political organization, but it appears Trump is merely replacing it with a fascist organization that will be even worse. In their desperation to oppose President Obama at every turn using hate and fear to gin up opposition and extremism, Republicans created the atmosphere for someone like Trump to rise and thrive and now they are paying the price for it. And so is America. One wonders how long it will be before even Republicans wish that President Obama could stay in office for another four years.Featured image via video screen capture",0.0
Republicans' Congress lull could impede a Clinton presidency,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in Congress are planning a light legislative agenda as they return from their long summer break on Tuesday, a strategy some say is designed in part to bog down Hillary Clinton if she becomes president.  It is not uncommon for the Congress to take it slow in an election year and legislative delays could work in Republicans favor if their nominee Donald Trump takes the White House in November. But the strategy will also pay dividends if it is Clinton who takes office on Jan. 20. She will be forced to deal with old baggage rather than focus on her agenda of infrastructure investments and immigration and Wall Street reforms. If Hillary wins, we force her to waste time, resources, momentum, early good will and political capital - all on cleanup duty, said a senior aide to one Republican senator. If all goes as expected this autumn, a U.S. Supreme Court seat, vacant since Feb. 13, will remain unfilled until sometime next year. A sweeping Pacific free-trade deal negotiated by President Barack Obama will be on hold, if not doomed. And if many conservative Republicans get their way, government agencies will run on stop-gap funding from Oct. 1 until sometime in February or March. That means that the next president would have to negotiate a longer-term deal or face the prospect of government shutdowns in the early days of a new administration. Senior congressional aides have told Reuters their agenda for the coming months include bills to keep the government funded, combat the spreading Zika virus and renewing laws guarding the nations water resources. Other items would help the majority Republicans score political points with key constituencies before the November elections, even though they have no chance of becoming law. These include scolding the Obama administration for a $400 million payment to Iran in January after Tehran released American prisoners, anti-abortion measures and, once again, proposals to repeal Obamas landmark healthcare law. Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist and former aide to Republican leaders in Congress, acknowledged that public opinion polling is trending in Clintons direction. If Clinton wins, Bonjean added, The whole mindset (among Republican leaders in Congress) would shift to taking care of the most important business to help Republicans and unloading the more difficult, tense issues for a Clinton administration to deal with. Clinton has maintained a lead in most polls since Republican and Democratic conventions, but some surveys showed that lead narrowing. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sept. 2 showed Trump effectively pulling even with the Democratic nominee. Yet one veteran Republican congressional aide said more and more Republicans in Congress brace for the White House to stay in Democratic hands for the next four years, even if their party manages to maintain control of Congress. Trumps trouble in appealing to important groups of voters, such as Hispanics, African-Americans and Asians, and self-inflicted wounds have made it pretty clear hes highly unlikely to get there, he said. Leaving the Supreme Court nomination and other high-profile disagreements for 2017 does bog down a new administration, no question about it, the aide said. Some election years mean a slow autumn in Congress, but this is not always the case. In 2012 for example, lawmakers dramatically labored all the way through New Years Eve addressing a fiscal cliff of expiring tax and spending laws.  Not all of the delays in passing legislation are purely on Republican shoulders though. While Trump has blasted free-trade deals, leading Democrats, including Clinton, also have criticized Obamas Trans-Pacific Partnership pact that would create a free-trade zone ranging from Japan to Chile. Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, downplayed the challenges Clinton might face early on. She knows how to deal with Congress. Shes been there, he said referring to Clintons years as a senator representing New York. Besides, he added, if Trump loses, Republicans will be busy dealing with their own problems.  Theyll have to think seriously about how they got themselves in the trouble that theyre in. ",1.0
Health Secretary Price's use of private jets under review,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Health Secretary Tom Prices use of private jets for government travel was under investigation on Friday after an internal watchdog agreed to review the issue following calls by Democrats for a probe. Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General Daniel Levinsons office said it would request Prices travel records and seek to review their justification. Price has taken at least two dozen such charter flights since May at a cost to U.S. taxpayers of about $300,000, according to Politico, which first reported the travel. HHSs Office of the Inspector General is conducting a review of Secretary Prices federal travel using chartered aircraft. The review focuses on whether the travel complied with Federal Travel Regulations, but may encompass other issues related to the travel, said Levinsons spokeswoman, Tesia Williams, adding that it would be finished as soon as possible. The move comes after House Democratic lawmakers called for the internal review earlier this week. [nL2N1M203S] Separately, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reforms top Democrat, U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings, also asked Price for details on the flights and called on panel chairman Trey Gowdy to hold an immediate hearing on the issue. Representatives for Price did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the investigation, earlier reported by the Washington Post and NBC News.  HHS spokeswoman Charmaine Yoest defended Prices travels, telling the Post: This is Secretary Price, getting outside of D.C., making sure he is connected with the real American people and adding that commercial flights could have lengthy delays or force him to miss public events.  In a letter to Price, Cummings asked the secretary for details on the number of flights, the full costs and any documentation about their purpose by Oct. 10. If these reports are accurate, this would be a stunning and hypocritical breach of trust given that the Trump Administration ... is trying to take away health care from millions of Americans and is proposing to slash funding at HHS, he wrote.   As a U.S. lawmaker in 2009, Price chastised the fiscal irresponsibility of government private plane use in an appearance on CNBC that he also posted on Twitter at the time. Questions over Prices charter flights come as another top U.S. official, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, is facing scrutiny over his use of a government plane to fly to Kentucky for a visit to Louisville and Fort Knox. Mnuchin and his wife viewed the solar eclipse during the trip, which was to an area of the country that experienced the full eclipse. [nL2N1LI0YD] ",1.0
New White House chief of staff assures attorney general his job is safe,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New White House Chief of Staff John Kelly told Attorney General Jeff Sessions last weekend that his job was safe after Sessions endured several weeks of sharp public criticism from President Donald Trump, a senior U.S. official said on Wednesday. Kelly, who was named chief of staff by Trump on Friday, phoned Sessions on Saturday to reassure him the White House wanted him to remain as head of the Justice Department, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The conversation was first reported by the Associated Press. Kelly said Trump was still annoyed with Sessions decision in March to recuse himself from the investigation of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign, but there had been kind of a thaw in Trumps attitude toward him, according to the official. The White House did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment. The Kremlin says it did not interfere in the election, and Trump has denied any collusion. Last week, Trump assailed Sessions in a tweet as very weak and said he was very disappointed with his attorney general in a Wall Street Journal interview. When asked at a news conference last week about Sessions future, Trump replied: Time will tell. Time will tell. Republican lawmakers rallied to the defense of Sessions, a former U.S. senator from Alabama, and Trump has not mentioned him in tweets in recent days.  ",1.0
"Portugal approves 2018 budget, seeks to trim deficit further","LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal s parliament on Monday approved in the final reading the minority Socialist government s 2018 budget bill that aims to trim the deficit to a new low in the country s democratic history thanks to continuing, if slower, economic growth. The budget was approved by the Socialists and their far-left allies in parliament - the Communists and Left Bloc - who together hold 122 seats in the 230-seat house. The remaining lawmakers voted against the document that set the deficit at 1.1 percent of gross domestic product. The allies have already reversed many of the austerity policies of the previous center-right administration introduced under an international bailout program in 2011-14, and next year s plan carries more measures like tax cuts for low to medium incomes and higher pensions.   The Socialist administration has debunked the myth that to have balanced accounts it is necessary to sacrifice the economy, jobs and well-being of Portuguese,  Pedro Nuno Santos, secretary of state for parliament affairs, told lawmakers. The budget envisages that Portugal s strongest economic performance in at least a decade will extend into next year, with investment, tourism and exports remaining robust. But growth will slow to 2.2 percent from 2017 s 2.6 percent.  Despite the approval, some analysts say that during the budget discussions pressure has been building on Prime Minister Antonio Costa, who came to power exactly two years ago, from the left and the unions for more state spending. That could make it more difficult to maintain the budget cuts down the road.  As the 2019 electoral period approaches, there will be more serious pressure on the government, and the trend is no longer that of accelerating growth,  said political scientist Antonio Costa Pinto of the University of Lisbon.   They ve had good growth and deficit numbers in the first two years but those will be difficult to replicate,  he said, adding though that potential tensions between the government and its allies were unlikely to result in any political crisis.  The projected deficit is higher than the initial 1 percent plan due to hundreds of millions of euros added to expenditure on aid and reconstruction after devastating fires in June and October this year, which killed over 100 people and were an embarrassment to the government. Still, the gap is poised to narrow from this year s projected 1.4 percent - the lowest since Portugal returned to democracy in 1974 - as the economy is expected to grow for the fifth consecutive year. Nevertheless, Brussels has warned Portugal, along with several other countries, that their budgeted structural deficit cuts in 2018 fell short of EU requirements while some government spending also caused concerns.  The European Commission has also put Portugal s overall 2018 budget gap at 1.4 percent, the same as this year.  Costa argues that his government will allay Brussels  concerns  with each month that passes , citing his record of beating deficit-busting targets in 2016 and 2017. ",1.0
"Uzbekistan pulls students, teachers, nurses from cotton fields: sources","TASHKENT (Reuters) - Uzbekistan has abruptly recalled thousands of school teachers, college students and healthcare workers from cotton fields, halting a practice condemned abroad as forced labor, government officials and other sources told Reuters on Friday. The Central Asian nation is one of the world s leading cotton exporters and for years it has mobilized the students as well as staff at schools and clinics to pick the autumn harvest. It phased out using minors in 2015 under international pressure that included boycott campaigns. Officially, the work is voluntary and paid at about $0.005 per kilogram. In reality those who refuse risk expulsion or the sack unless they bribe an official or hire someone to work in their place, sources said. The harvest started this month but late on Thursday the Tashkent government ordered the cotton pickers home, said a district official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment. The government declined to comment. A central government official who also asked not to be named said an order barring the use of such workers had in fact been issued in August. On Thursday Tashkent warned regional governors they would be sacked if they fail to comply with it. The district official said regional governments have been ordered to hire unemployed locals for cotton picking instead. Several students and a school director, who all requested anonymity, said they had been ordered to return to class or had their trips to the field canceled at the last moment. Despite ending the use of child labor, Uzbekistan ranked among the top five worst offenders in the Global Slavery Index compiled last year by activist group Walk Free Foundation. The group estimated that almost 4 percent of Uzbekistan s population - then 31 million - lived in  modern slavery,  putting it second only to North Korea by that metric. The move to end the practice follows reforms by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev who took over the former Soviet republic after the death of strongman leader Islam Karimov last September. Mirziyoyev has moved to liberalize foreign exchange and travel regulations and had about 16,000 people struck off a blacklist of potential extremists, reforms that may help him rebuild ties with the West and attract foreign investment.

MISSISSIPPI Gov Signs Confederate Heritage Month BillWill Obama Send Black Lives Matter Terrorists Down To Correct Their Mistake?,"How long will it take for Obama s Army to descend on Mississippi? Black Lives Matter is far from a spontaneous movement. Obama and his race hustler friends have been working towards this goal for decades. It s really quite sad to see the racial divide in America today. College kids are being indoctrinated into thinking White=bad and Black=victim. How can this possibly be a good thing for our nation? Obama has made no secret about wanting to take America down a few notches, it doesn t take a brain surgeon to see that by dividing our nation by race, ethnicity, gender and income, we will never be able to come together when faced with a crisis. Make no mistake about it, with all of the un-vetted  refugees'  we re bringing to America, all of the illegals we re allowing to flood across our borders, and all of the dangerous prisoners (including Gitmo) Obama is releasing from our prisons, we WILL be faced with a crisis before Obama leaves office. January 2017 can t come fast enough   A house divided against itself cannot stand  -Abraham LincolnUPDATE Friday: Bryant spokesman Clay Chandler tweeted an updated Proclamations page, which now includes Confederate Heritage Day, as well as Vernon Dahmer Day, Irish Heritage Month and Ronald Reagan Day but no Black History Month.Two weeks before the Mississippi Legislature allowed 19 state flag bills to die in committee, Gov. Phil Bryant took out a pen and signed an official governor s proclamation, declaring the month of April  Confederate Heritage Month,  a routine occurrence in Mississippi and several other southern states.The proclamation, which does not appear on the State of Mississippi s website with other proclamations, such as about emergency inclement weather, is posted on the website of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, which is ferociously against changing the Mississippi flag to remove the Confederate battle flag which supporters like to call the  Beauregard flag from its canton.On Bryant s gubernatorial letterhead, the proclamation starts out by explaining that April is the appropriate month to honor Confederate heritage because it  is the month in which the Confederate States began and ended a four-year struggle.

Tree trimming firm pays biggest fine in U.S. immigration case,"(Reuters) - A tree trimming company has been handed the largest penalty imposed in a United States immigration case, totaling $95 million, after pleading guilty to employing illegal immigrants, the U.S. Attorneys Office said. Immigration reform is a major political issue in the U.S., with  President Donald Trump saying he will crack down on illegal immigrants and build a wall between the United States and Mexico in order to reduce illegal border crossings.  Asplundh Tree Experts, Co., which trims trees and clears brush for power and gas lines across the country, hired employees who provided fake identification documents from 2010 to 2014, the U.S. Attorneys Office in Philadelphia said.  The prosecutor said on Thursday that Asplundhs management were willfully blind, while supervisors and general foremen hired illegal immigrants through word of mouth referrals.  This decentralized model tacitly perpetuated fraudulent hiring practices that, in turn, maximized productivity and profit, it said.  The companys chairman and CEO Scott Asplundh said in a statement that it has taken steps to improve its hiring practices, including reviewing the identification of all employees.  We accept responsibility for the charges as outlined, and we apologize to our customers, associates and all other stakeholders for what has occurred, he said.   ",1.0
SECRET DUMPS OF TOXIC WASTE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY BY EPA: Will The Government Bullies At The EPA Finally Be Exposed?,"This story gets more and more unbelievable every day The EPA has a record of releasing toxic runoff from mines in two tiny Colorado towns that dates to 2005, a local mine owner claims.The 3-million-gallon heavy-metal spill two weeks ago in Silverton polluted three states and touched off national outrage. But the EPA escaped public wrath in 2005 when it secretly dumped up to 15,000 tons of poisonous waste into another mine 124 miles away. That dump   containing arsenic, lead and other materials   materialized in runoff in the town of Leadville, said Todd Hennis, who owns both mines along with numerous others. If a private company had done this, they would ve been fined out of existence,  Hennis said.  I have been battling the EPA for 10 years and they have done nothing but create pollution. About 20 percent (of Silverton residents) think it s on purpose so they can declare the whole area a Superfund site. Like Silverton to the south, Leadville was founded in the late 1800s as a mining town and is the only municipality in its county. Today, tourism is its livelihood.It s against this backdrop that the Environmental Protection Agency began lobbying to declare part of Leadville a Superfund site in order to develop a recreational area called the Mineral Belt Trail. The project was officially completed in 2000, but apparently the agency stayed on and continued to work in town.In late 2005, the EPA collected tons of sludge from two Leadville mines and secretly dumped it down the shaft of the New Mikado mine without notifying Hennis, its owner, according to documents reviewed by Watchdog.A drainage tunnel had been installed at the bottom of the mine shaft by the U.S. government in 1942, meaning that any snow or rain would leach toxins into the surrounding land.Hennis said the EPA claims it has installed a treatment pond near the tunnel to clean runoff. The EPA rebuffed his demands to clean up the mess it created in his mine, he said. In frustration, Hennis sent the county sheriff a certified notice that any EPA officials found near his property were trespassing and should be arrested.Despite that history of bitterness, in 2010, the EPA asked Hennis to grant its agents access to Gold King Mine in Silverton because the agency was investigating hazardous runoff from other mines in the region. I said,  No, I don t want you on my land out of fear that you will create additional pollution like you did in Leadville,  Hennis said. The official request turned into a threat, Hennis said:  They said,  If you don t give us access within four days, we will fine you $35,000 a day. An EPA administrative order dated May 12, 2011 said its inspectors wanted to conduct  drilling of holes and installing monitoring wells, sampling and monitoring water, soil, and mine waste material from mine water rock dumps as necessary to evaluate releases of hazardous substances When the EPA hit Hennis with $300,000 in fines, he said, he  waved the white flag  and allowed the agency on his property.So for the past four years, the EPA has been working at the mine and two others nearby   all which border a creek that funnels into the Animas River. One mine to the north had been walled off with cement by its owner but it continued to leak water into Gold King. The EPA installed a drainage ditch on the Gold King side of the mine to alleviate the problem, but then accidentally filled the ditch with dirt and rocks last summer while building a water-retention wall.That was the wall that burst when a contractor punched a hole in the top on Aug. 5, sending a bright orange stream cascading down. The EPA looked like the Keystone Kops as anger intensified in the media and general public: 24 hours passed with no notification to the lower states or Navajo Nation; the White House ignored mentioning the incident; and it took a week for the EPA administrator to tour Durango downstream, while refusing to visit Silverton itself.The EPA says cleaning ponds have been installed to leach toxins from the water, and claims that anything released now is actually cleaner than before the spill occurred. The fallout from this disaster in the lower states is still unknown.Also unknown is the fate of Silverton itself. For months, the EPA has been pushing town leaders into allowing designation as a Superfund site out of belief that the whole town is contaminated. This is something the town has resisted, as its reputation is at stake and no current tests have shown any evidence of toxic soil levels. Whenever we hear the word  EPA,  we think of Superfund,  said Silverton Town Board Trustee David Zanoni.  They say,  We want to work together.  That s B.S. They want to come in and take over. The water up here is naturally filled with minerals. They don t need to be here cleaning up. If the EPA s litany of mistakes at Gold King mine is a barometer, Zanoni said, handing over the reins of Silverton would be a disaster. They had no contingency plan in case all of this went to hell,  he said.The EPA could not be reached for comment.Via: Watchdog.org",0.0
 Trump Congratulates Himself For His Own Press Conference And Twitter SHATTERS His Fragile Ego,"Donald Trump blew his own horn after his first press conference in six months on Wednesday, and Americans swiftly told him to shut the hell up.During the conference, Trump attacked the media over a leaked dossier of unverified information that included a claim that he was videotaped at the Ritz Carlton hotel in Moscow paying prostitutes to pee on the bed in the presidential suite that President Obama once stayed in. The scandal has gone viral and is being dubbed  Golden Showers. The dossier also alleges that Trump colluded with the Russians to attack Hillary Clinton among many other claims.Trump lost his shit during the conference when CNN reporter Jim Acosta asked him some questions, and at one point, threatened Buzzfeed with  consequences  for publishing the unflattering material.Soon after the press conference, Trump praised himself on Twitter and referred to CNN and Buzzfeed as  fake news  while declaring that people believe him instead of the press.We had a great News Conference at Trump Tower today.

"Typhoon leaves flooding, four dead in Japan before moving out to sea","TOKYO (Reuters) - A rapidly weakening typhoon Lan made landfall in Japan on Monday, setting off landslides and flooding that prompted evacuation orders for tens of thousands of people, but then headed out to sea after largely sparing the capital, Tokyo. Four people were reported killed, hundreds of plane flights  canceled, and train services disrupted in the wake of Lan, which had maintained intense strength until virtually the time it made landfall west of Tokyo in the early hours of Monday.  At least four people were killed, including a man who was hit by falling scaffolding, a fisherman tending to his boat, and  a young woman whose car had been washed away by floodwaters. Another casualty was left comatose by injuries and a man was missing, NHK public television said. Around 130 others suffered minor injuries. Rivers burst their banks in several parts of Japan and fishing boats were tossed up on land. A container ship was stranded after being swept onto a harbor wall but all 19 crew members escaped injury. Some 80,000 people in Koriyama, a city 200 km (124 miles) north of Tokyo, were ordered to evacuate as a river neared the top of its banks, NHK said, but by afternoon water levels were starting to fall. Several hundred houses in western Japan were flooded.  My grandchild lives over there. The house is fine, but the area is flooded, and they can t get out,  one man told NHK. Lan had weakened to a category 2 storm when it made landfall early on Monday, sideswiping Tokyo, after powering north for days as an intense category 4 storm, according to the Tropical Storm Risk monitoring site. Lan is the Marshall islands word for  storm . By Monday afternoon the storm had been downgraded to a tropical depression and it was in the Pacific, east of the northernmost main island of Hokkaido, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.  Around 350 flights were canceled and train services disrupted over a wide area of Japan, although most commuter trains were running smoothly in Tokyo.  Toyota Motor Corp canceled the first shift at all of its assembly plants but said it would operate the second shift as normal. ",1.0
MATTEL Features Boy In Girly Barbie CommercialDoing Their Part To Help Letists Blur The Gender Lines [VIDEO],"Newsflash for Mattel, and any other company who is pandering to the Left this Christmas season: God did not create Gender-Neutral beings God made man and woman to be different for a reason Don t mess with God A boy is featured in the latest Barbie commercial for the first time ever. The commercial is receiving widespread praise for upending gender barriers. The ad displays Mattel s new line of Barbie dolls created as part of a partnership with the Italian fashion house Moschino. The dolls sport outfits of black mesh and leather, with edgy golden accessories to match.However, it is not the dolls  racy clothing that steals the show, but rather, the mohawked boy playing with the dolls.  Moschino Barbie is so fierce,  he exclaims to the camera with an exaggerated head roll. This single line is garnering the Barbie boy a huge fan base worldwide.The public now accepts homosexuality and same-sex  marriage.  But the fight is not over. The offensive to reshape society in even more radical ways pushes forward.An effort is gaining ground to create a world where not just  sexual orientation,  but sex itself, is a choice. Where boys can be girls and girls can be boys, or something in between. Where people are expected to ignore the biological reality of sex so that all people coexist androgynously, or according to whatever gender suits them at the moment. Where everyone pretends that gender confusion is normal, if not desirable, and anyone who doesn t play along can be punished and silenced.This demonstrates unprecedented contempt for reality and common sense, let alone morality.Think of the implications with respect to public bathrooms, sex-segregated activities, locker rooms, college student housing and countless other areas of human interaction.Does the idea of a boy who thinks he s a girl showering next to your daughter in P.E. class make you uncomfortable? Then you d better brace yourself. This cause is winning critical legal battles and it is starting with our youth.Earlier this month, the California Senate passed a bill saying that throughout K-12 education, a student is  permitted to participate in sex-segregated school programs and activities, including athletic teams and competitions, and use facilities [e.g. bathrooms, locker rooms] consistent with his or her gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed on the pupil s records.   Gender identity  is the terminology these ultrasensitive, morally sophisticated lawmakers use to refer to the sex a person happens to identify with.Last month, a governing body in Colorado ruled that a 6-year-old boy who thinks he s a girl has the right to use the girl s bathroom at his elementary school. The Colorado Division of Civil Rights said that denying him that right  creates an environment rife with harassment  and is akin to racial segregation.See where this is going? The public majority already agrees that denying same-sex couples the right to  marry  is exactly like prohibiting interracial marriage. Now, denying someone access to a public bathroom on the basis of biology is just like excluding blacks from white-only facilities.These lawmakers and officials are determined to ensure that these children grow up in a world where sex confusion is welcomed, even encouraged.What about the girl who feels awkward about having a boy walk in while she s using the bathroom? Sorry. She is the one who needs to adjust her thinking not the boy.But there is something far more sinister going on here. Mattel is not just using the ad to connect with little boys who play with Barbie dolls; it is using the ad to smash gender roles.It s no secret that society is moving away from gender-based toys for children. Target is in the process of removing gender-based signs from their toy section, and Hasbro switched to a gender-neutral Easy-Bake Oven a few years ago.The Moschino Barbie commercial is just another step in society s pursuit to radically change social expectations. But is including a boy in a Barbie ad really  progress  and  common sense,  as one news source put it? Via: The Trumpet",0.0
"Blast hits Afghan capital near Shi'ite mosque, killing at least one","KABUL (Reuters) - Islamic State claimed responsibility for a suicide attack near a large Shi ite mosque in the Afghan capital on Friday that killed at least one person and wounded five others. The blast hit the Qala-e Fatehullah area of the city, near the Hussainya mosque, and came as security forces were on alert for possible attacks during Ashura, the holiest celebration in the Shi ite religious calendar. President Ashraf Ghani issued a statement saying that the attackers would not be able to shake the unity of the Afghan people with their  inhumane and irreligious  attacks. A statement from Islamic State, which has claimed a string of attacks on Shi ite targets over the past two years, said its fighters had carried out the attack. Afghanistan, a mainly Sunni Islamic country, has mostly avoided the sectarian violence that has devastated countries such as Iraq, but there have been increasing numbers of attacks on Shi ite targets in recent years. Security officials said at least two attackers had been killed as they carried out the operation, apparently intended to hit the mosque, just a month after 20 people were killed during prayers at another Shi ite mosque in Kabul. A hospital run by the Italian aid group Emergency said five wounded had been brought in following the blast but a witness at the scene said eight or nine people had been wounded or killed. The local affiliate of Islamic State has claimed several attacks on Shi ite targets in Kabul in recent years and the government has allowed the Shi ite community to place armed guards near mosques ahead of Ashura. No reliable census information exists on the size of the Shi ite community in Afghanistan, but estimates range around 10-20 percent, with most coming from the Persian-speaking Hazara and Tajik ethnic groups.

 Inmate Dead From Alleged Mistreatment In Jail Run By Infamous Pro-Trump Sheriff,"Milwaukee Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. has been a fixture on Fox News in recent months, appearing on multiple programs on that network to attack the Black Lives Matter movement, which he has compared several times to international terrorists.Clarke has also been an outspoken supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, and is often one of the first names Trump backers bring up when attempting to highlight support for the candidate among black voters. Clarke spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this past summer.But while he was busy on the cable network attacking the black community, a man died in the jail under his command. He reportedly died of thirst, of all things.Terrill Thomas, 38, was found dead in a Milwaukee County Jail cell on April 24, nine days after being arrested in connection with a shooting. Other inmates heard Thomas beg for water in the days before he died, the Journal Sentinel reported in July.[ ]Last week the Milwaukee County medical examiner announced that Thomas  death was due to profound dehydration, according to the Journal Sentinel. By labeling the death a homicide, the medical examiner indicated that it was caused by the actions of another person, although that judgment does not necessarily mean that anyone will be criminally prosecuted in the case.Inmates at the jail say the water in Thomas  jail cell had been cut off for 6 days, and that one inmate warned jailers about the danger to the man s life. Attorney Erik J. Heipt told the site that he has received calls from other inmates to tell him that the water had been cut off to their cells, and another inmate died in 2011 when his water was cut off as well.Clarke is reportedly part of a pro-Trump bus tour arranged by a super PAC that is supporting the candidate.The Huffington Post also reports that Clarke took in over $150,000 in 2015 from  speaking fees, travel reimbursements and gifts.

BREAKING: NORTHWESTERN FOOTBALL PLAYERS SHOT DOWN IN BID TO TOTALLY RUIN COLLEGE FOOTBALL,"And the AFL-CIO is crying in their money pit wouldn t it be a great get to have college football players unionized? The players are students and not employees unless you want to bust this whole thing wide open and tell the truth about how players might be compensated. It s really pretty shocking that the NLRB decided to shoot this down since they re 3-2 Dem. The National Labor Relations Board rejected a bid by football players at Northwestern University to form a union. In an unanimous decision released Monday, the board said it lacked jurisdiction in the matter. By statute the board does not have jurisdiction over state-run colleges and universities,  it said. The board is the main federal labor law enforcement agency. Its members are nominated by the president and it currently has a 3-2 Democratic majority.The announcement reverses a March 2014 decision by a board regional director, who ruled that the players were employees of the university, not students. Therefore, they had the right to form a union.While that ruling applied only to Northwestern athletes, it had major implications for college athletics generally, being the first time a student-athlete group has been granted collective bargaining rights. Other groups could have cited it as a precedent if they tried to unionize.Via: Washington Examiner",0.0
 Florida GOPer Wants LGBT Flag Removed Because She Spoke With One Christian Who Found It Offensive,"A rainbow flag raised to honor the LGBT victims in the worst mass shooting in American history is in danger of being removed from the Hillsborough County center in Tampa Bay, Florida, because a Republican official said she talked to a Christian (singular) who said the flag was  unbearable.  Priorities!The pride flag was raised just hours after Hillsborough s commissioners voted 5-1 to hang the flag for the remainder of the month both in acknowledgement of it being Pride Month and in honor of the victims of Orlando, many of whom were LGBT and whose killer was reportedly vehemently anti-gay.Rather than see this as a symbol of unity during the wake of a national tragedy, one Republican commissioner, Stacy White, decided to make this all about fake Christian oppression. Apparently, just seeing the rainbow colors has caused one of her constituents to feel like she can t even drive to work. In an email sent to her fellow commissioners, White complains about how the rainbow flag might be harming those with  strong Christian values. Warning: Her letter is bonkers.My office recently received an anonymous phone call from a county employee stating that, because of her strong Christian beliefs, it will be nearly unbearable for her pass the  pride  flag each morning as she enters the workplace. She clearly indicated that the display of that flag, for her, has created a hostile work environment.My question is, given the nature of this employee complaint, has the board s action taken this past Wednesday created any issues for the county from a Human Resources perspective? If the display of this flag exposes the county any liability whatsoever, I request that it be taken down on the basis that the board s action has violated the workplace rights of some of our employees.White closed her letter out by referring to the Pride Flag as a  divisive, politically-charged symbol  inappropriate for  our workplace. In a country that still routinely displays a flag used in the Civil War to rally around slavery on state property, you may need a microscope and a very steady hand to create a violin small enough to play for White s pity party here. It s also particularly astounding that Republicans can somehow take a hate crime perpetuated on (mostly) LGBT Latinos and somehow make it all about them.Ironically, in the days after the shooting, Republicans shamelessly attempted to leverage the raw emotions of the LGBT community to make the, frankly insulting, pitch that the gay community should vote for Republicans because they could keep them safe from Muslims. The LGBT community, having had decades of experience in picking up on when they are being pandered to, gave the GOP a resounding middle finger and instead demanded America solve a much more dangerous problem: Guns.Apparently, having realized gay people weren t taking the bait, Republicans have reverted back to bashing them instead. Now, just a week after the shooting, Commissioner Stacy White is unflinchingly accusing a symbol of their pride of being  unbearable  to Christians. In several other Republican-dominated counties across America, officials have also refused to honor President Obama s request to lower their flags to half-mast based on technicalities. An obnoxious form of grandstanding meant to signal to their most bigoted voters that they don t really like gay people, so please don t vote them out.Thankfully in Hillsborough at least the other commissioners seem to have an ounce of common decency. Faced with White s pitiable letter, they kindly told her to shove it.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",0.0

Cuba issues bristling editorial ahead of Obama visit,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba said it would welcome President Barack Obama to Havana later this month, but the Communist government had no intention of changing its policies in exchange for normal relations with the United States. In a long editorial on Wednesday in Communist Party newspaper Granma and other official media, Cuba demanded Washington cease meddling in its internal affairs and said Obama could do more to change U.S. policy. The White House brushed off the piece and defended the presidents trip next month as an opportunity to engage both with Cubas government and its citizens.    Obama will visit on March 20-22, 15 months after he and Cuban President Raul Castro agreed to end more than five decades of Cold War-era animosity.  They have restored diplomatic ties, and Obama has relaxed a trade sanctions and travel restrictions, leading Republican opponents and some of the presidents fellow Democrats to question whether Washington was offering too much without reciprocation from Havana. But the editorial made it clear that Cuba still has a long list of grievances with the United States, starting with the comprehensive trade embargo. Obama wants to rescind the embargo but Republican leadership in Congress has blocked the move. Cuba also objected to U.S. support for its political dissidents, whom some Americans consider champions of human rights but whom the Cuban government views as an unrepresentative minority funded by U.S. interests. (The United States) should abandon the pretense of fabricating an internal political opposition, paid for with money from U.S. taxpayers, the nearly 3,000-word editorial said.  White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters that Obamas long agenda includes visiting with political opposition of the Cuban government and standing up for, in a very tangible way, the universal human rights of the Cuban people. Obama visit will be only the second by a U.S. president and the first since the 1959 revolution led by Fidel Castro that overthrew a pro-American government. The editorial said Cuba no one should assume Cuba had to renounce any of its principles or cede the slightest bit in its defense to do so. The two countries have also negotiated greater cooperation on law enforcement and environmental issues and agreed to resume scheduled commercial flights and postal services. Obama has removed Cuba from a list of state sponsors of terrorism. The editorial acknowledged Obama had taken positive steps but criticized their limited nature and the existence of other regulations and intimidation caused by the overall blockade that has been in force for more than 50 years.

Trump calls Ford building plant in Mexico 'an absolute disgrace',"DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump said the move by Ford Motor Co (F.N) to build a manufacturing plant in Mexico is an absolute disgrace and shows the need to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Earlier on Tuesday, Ford confirmed plans to build a plant in San Luis Potosi and an investment of $1.6 billion. This transaction is an absolute disgrace, said Trumps statement, sent to Reuters by email. Our dishonest politicians and the special interests that control them are laughing in the face of all American citizens. Trump said deals like the one Michigan-based Ford made to build a plant in Mexico will continue until we can renegotiate NAFTA to create a fair deal for American workers. Ford did not have an immediate comment on Trumps statement, but two weeks ago its chief executive, Mark Fields, said Ford would not back away from foreign investments if they made sense. We are a global, multinational company and we will invest to keep us competitive and we will do what makes sense for the business, Fields said. Ford currently has more workers and makes more vehicles at its U.S. plants than do Detroit rivals General Motors Co (GM.N) or Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU.N) (FCHA.MI), and has fewer workers and makes fewer vehicles in Mexico than the other automakers. GM has about 12,000 hourly paid workers in Mexico, while FCA has 9,547 and Ford has 6,191, the companies said on Tuesday. In the United States, Ford has 55,300 hourly paid plant workers, GM has 54,000 and FCA has 36,600, the companies said. In 2015, 80 percent of Fords North American production came from its U.S. plants while 63 percent of GMs North American production came from its U.S. plants and for FCA 64 percent of its North American production came from its U.S. plants.

 Former Secretary Of Defense Has Some SCATHING Words For Unqualified And Unfit Trump (TWEET),"Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates has judged both Republican and Democratic residential candidates for their ideas on foreign policy, but it s clear that he only believes that there s one nominee that is  beyond repair    Donald Trump.Gates, who has served under George W. Bush as well as Barack Obama, recently published a brutal op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that examines both Trump and Hillary Clinton for their plans on handling America s challenging relations with nations like Russia, China and the Middle East.Although Clinton was nowhere near exempt from criticism, Gates saved his harshest words for her GOP rival. Gates noted that the former Secretary of State has much-discussed credibility issues apart from national security, but these also influence foreign perceptions of reliability and trust.  However, Trump is  in a league of his own  when it comes to credibility.Gates reminded Americans that Trump openly supports and shines praise on leaders like Vladimir Putin and Saddam Hussein, and is all for unethical torture practices and the killing of terrorist s families. Gates also mentioned the fact that Trump likes the idea of Japan and South Korea developing nuclear weapons. Gates said: At least on national security, I believe Mr. Trump is beyond repair. He is stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government, and temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform. He is unqualified and unfit to be commander-in-chief. As soon as Gates  op-ed was discovered by Trump, the business mogul predictably went on Twitter to throw one of his infamous man-baby temper tantrums:TwitterTo challenge Trump s tweet, NPR Morning Edition reporter Steve Inskeep invited Trump to an interview about foreign policy on his show, which the Trump campaign had said they d do about 250 days ago.TwitterAs expected, the Trump campaign has now fallen silent on the subject.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla and Spencer Platt / Getty Images",0.0
Brazil prosecutor charges members of Temer's party with criminal organization,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil s top prosecutor on Friday charged six lawmakers from President Michel Temer s Brazilian Democracy Movement Party (PMDB) with forming a criminal organization, the latest in a barrage of charges in the country s sprawling corruption scandal. Those accused by prosecutor Rodrigo Janot in a filing with the Supreme Court include former senator and president Jose Sarney, the government s leader in the Senate Romero Juca and four other current senators. A corruption scandal involving cartels of companies bribing officials for public contracts has enveloped most of Brazil s political elite with Janot expected to issue another charge against Temer in coming weeks.  Temer defeated a first corruption charge from Janot, when the lower house of Congress voted not to allow it to proceed to trial. Separately on Friday, the Supreme Court said it would consider next week requests from Temer that would block Janot from issuing further charges. In the charges against the senators, Janot alleges the group  unduly received 864 million reais ($279.84 million) and generated related losses of 5.5 billion reais for state-controlled oil firm Petrobras and 113 million reais for its subsidiary Transpetro. Transpetro s former president, Sergio Machado, was also charged. The PMDB said in a statement that the prosecutor lacked evidence and that it trusted the Supreme Court would set the charges aside. Juca said in a statement he believes the Supreme Court will seriously analyze the charges and he hopes for a speedy investigation. A representative for Machado said he continues to collaborate with authorities, providing evidence of crimes involving politicians and Transpetro suppliers that resulted in several cases being filed. Janot s latest charges echo those against former presidents Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Dilma Rousseff and six other members of the Workers Party for criminal organization earlier this week. Lula and Rousseff deny the charges. ($1 = 3.0875 reais) ",1.0
 President Obamas Approval Rating Has Climbed To A Five Year High,"A new poll released from ABC/Washington Post shows some very good news for Democrats: not only is Hillary Clinton crushing Donald Trump, but President Obama s approval rating has hit a five year high   topping off at 56 percent of people who approve of him   a five point gain from the last poll conducted. Only 41 percent disapprove.The last time President Obama s approval rating was that high was when Osama bin Laden was killed in May 2011. It s also worth noting that the President s approval rating was taken in the immediate aftermath of the Orlando shooting, the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil since 9/11.But wait, there s more good news: not only does 56 percent of the American electorate approve of President Obama s presidency overall, 55 percent approve (42 disapprove) of his handling of the economy. Considering Trump likes to paint himself as the  best  man to handle the economy, the news should offer him and his campaign a much needed wake up call.As the Post noted:Obama is more popular now than Republicans George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush in the waning months of their presidencies. Although Obama s approval rating has not reached the level of former Democratic president Bill Clinton s in 2000, his standing suggests that he could be a relatively effective surrogate for Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail.Just think about it   Clinton already has a huge lead over Trump, and that s before the very popular President Obama has hit the campaign trail. Once Americans see what will be leaving and what might be succeeding them, one could expect to see not only Clinton s poll numbers to rise, but Obama s as well.So what say you, Republicans? A healthy majority of Americans support the president and loathe your candidate. I don t think Republicans get to talk about the  will  of the American people anymore. They have no ground to stand on, no leverage, and no one seems to be taking them seriously anymore.President Reagan s final year approval high was 65 percent, just nine points higher than President Obama s. The President still has six more months, and considering how unpopular Donald Trump is becoming, America should expect to see it climb higher.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",0.0
IS TIM ALLENS Last Man Standing About To Be Revived After Passionate Conservatives Express Outrage Over ABCs Decision To Cancel Show?,"Tim Allen took to Twitter to express his disappointment after discovering that the second highest rated comedy TV series on ABC,  Last Man Standing  was going to be cancelled:Stunned and blindsided by the network I called home for the last six years. #lastmanstanding  Tim Allen (@ofctimallen) May 16, 2017Many of his fans commented in support of his courage to stand up for his conservative views:Thanks for standing up and speaking out against the PC police for as long as you could, Tim.  Mark Dice (@MarkDice) May 16, 2017Conservative comedian Mark Dice also reminded him that his comments on a recent Jimmy Kimmel show about how it was tough to be a conservative in Hollywood, was likely the final straw that caused ABC to cancel his show: You calling out the Liberals for their insanity on Jimmy Kimmel was the last straw for the Network, but someone had to do it. Thanks, Tim!  Mark Dice (@MarkDice) May 16, 2017A petition was started last week by  Last Man Standing  fans and now has over 371K signatures. The petition asks ABC to reconsider their decision to cancel the  Last Man Standing  and to renew the show. Here is the LINK to that petition:The petition to ABC reads:Despite consistently high rankings, especially considering the time slot in which it is aired, Tim Allen s show  Last Man Standing  has been cancelled by the network on which it is aired, ABC. Last Man Standing stands out in the sea of network television sitcoms.  It is a show that appeals to a broad swath of Americans who find very few shows that extol the virtues with which they can identify; namely conservative values. Last Man Standing was not just selling conservative ideals though, as some of the characters in the show are clearly of the liberal persuasion, yet the characters on the show all manage to get along and take care of one another, despite their politically opposed views.  The show is about more than politics though, it is about family.  In fact, politics is only a secondary part of the show, but one in which many Americans can readily identify. Last Man Standing is one of the only shows on broadcast television, and the only sitcom, that is not constantly shoving liberal ideals down the throats of the viewers.  And sadly, that is likely the real reason the show has been cancelled.The intent of this petition/boycott is to attempt to get ABC to renew the show.  With that in mind, I will no longer be watching any ABC shows.  I have cancelled the DVR settings for the other ABC shows that I regularly watch.  If you want to help try to save Last Man Standing, I encourage you to do the same.  Even if you are not willing to boycott the network, but still want to save the show, please sign this petition and share it.  If you do plan to boycott ABC, please say so when you sign.  Let them hear our voices.Now, Studio 20th Century Fox Television is looking for a new home for canceled Tim Allen comedy  Last Man Standing. Speaking to Variety Thursday, studio presidents Jonnie Davis and Howard Kurtzman said that they were surprised by ABC s decision to pull the plug on the show. That s the one that s really an open sore right now,  Davis said. Kurtzman added,  We really were expecting a pickup. The fact that we didn t get a pickup was a surprise and a disappointment. I think no one was more disappointed than Tim Allen, such a huge star with such a huge following. But the series, which was ABC s second most-watched comedy last season behind  Modern Family,  may not be dead. Asked whether  Last Man Standing  would be shopped to other networks, Kurtzman said,  We re starting to explore that. If it s not going to go forward at ABC, of course Jonnie and I are hopeful that we can find another home for it. Political and social conservatives have been vocal in their disappointment over the show s end. Allen, its star and executive producer, is conservative and a supporter of President Trump.Speaking to reporters Tuesday, ABC entertainment president Channing Dungey denied that  Last Man Standing  was canceled because of Allen s right-leaning politics, and said that it was, instead, a scheduling decision.  Once we made the decision not to continue with comedy on Friday, it was just kind of that s where we landed,  she said.  VarietyTime will tell if ABC s fan base is more important to them than their liberal views ",0.0
Obama's defense chief doesn't see big changes in Iraq campaign,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ash Carter, who until January was U.S. defense secretary, said on Tuesday he did not see major changes in the campaign against Islamic State since President Donald Trump took office, amid accusations the U.S. military may be relaxing rules protecting civilians. I dont see overall major changes and I certainly hope they stay on the path that we set because I think thats the right path, Carter said at a forum at Harvard University, in his first public address since leaving the post. Carter declined to speculate about the investigation into an explosion in Mosul believed to have killed scores of civilians, even as he stressed the importance of probes of such incidents. The U.S. military has acknowledged a possible role in the incident but also says Islamic State could be to blame. ",1.0
"Cyclone batters southwestern India coast killing 14, many missing","MUMBAI (Reuters) - Cyclone Ockhi barrelled into the Lakshwadeep islands in southwestern India on Saturday after drenching the neighboring states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, claiming so far around 14 lives with many fishermen still feared trapped at sea.  Authorities including the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), India s Coast Guard and Navy have rescued about 223 fishermen and evacuated thousands of people from cyclone hit areas, officials said, as they continued their operations on Saturday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken to the chief minister of Tamil Nadu, assuring him of support operations including necessary funds, according to local media. Ockhi is expected to travel north towards Mumbai and Gujarat in the next 48 hours, according to Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) Director S. Sudevan in Trivandrum, though it is likely to lose intensity.  The intensity of the wind may come down and the cyclone could change into depression,  Sudevan said adding fishermen have been warned not go to the sea for the next few days as waves are likely to be 3-5 meters (12-15 feet) high.

Venezuela arrests ex-oil bosses for graft in widening purge,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan authorities on Thursday arrested two once-powerful officials who had run the oil ministry and state energy company PDVSA as part of a deepening industry purge also seen as a power play by leftist President Nicolas Maduro. In the highest-profile arrests to date, engineer Eulogio Del Pino and chemist Nelson Martinez were detained early on Thursday on accusations of graft and seeking to sabotage the nation s ailing energy industry, prosecutor Tarek Saab said in a televised speech.  He accused Del Pino of participating in a $500 million corruption and sabotage scheme at the Petrozamora joint venture with Russia s Gazprombank (GZPRI.MM) and said Martinez had allowed a poor refinancing deal for Venezuela s Citgo Petroleum Corp, a U.S.-based refiner that he used to lead, to go ahead without government approval.  We re talking about the dismantling of a cartel of organized crime that had taken over PDVSA,  Saab said as state television flashed a video of armed military intelligence agents knocking on doors and images of the two men being handcuffed and arrested.   Maduro has promised a vast anti-corruption purge to cleanse the oil industry of  mafias.  Some 65 executives have been detained so far, panicking PDVSA workers, depriving Venezuela s oil industry of much of its top brass, and stalling decision-making in the company overseeing the world s biggest crude reserves, insiders say.  The opposition dismisses the probe as a power struggle within Maduro s inner circle, noting that the industry has been under tight control of the ruling Socialist Party since early in the late President Hugo Chavez s 14-year rule. They say authorities ridiculed and dismissed a report last year by the opposition-run Congress, which concluded that some $11 billion went missing at PDVSA over a decade when Del Pino and Martinez were both influential officials. Insiders instead say the probe is politically motivated, likening it to a recent crackdown on graft in Saudi Arabia that has strengthened the power of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. PDVSA and Venezuela s Information and Oil ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reuters was unable to contact Del Pino or Martinez. In a video recorded before his arrest that he published on his Twitter account on Thursday afternoon, Del Pino defended himself and said he was the  victim  of an  unjustified attack,  but did not elaborate on who was to blame for his arrest.   We know there are irregularities, and I am the first who, through internal control mechanisms ... (made us) denounce and push ahead with investigations,  said a tired-looking Del Pino, speaking under a large tree. The arrests of Del Pino and Martinez have brought more attention to Rafael Ramirez, who was Venezuela s all-powerful oil czar for a decade and under whom both men ascended.  Maduro fired Ramirez, who was thought to have presidential ambitions, from his job as representative to the United Nations on Tuesday and summoned him back to Caracas from New York, according to people with knowledge of the situation. Those people say a protracted rivalry between the two men has deepened in recent weeks, especially after Ramirez wrote online opinion articles criticizing PDVSA s production slump and Maduro s handling of the economy.  Saab did not mention Ramirez by name, although both Maduro and top officials have recently repeatedly referred to his governance as oil boss as a time when  mafias  were formed and executives came to think of themselves as the owners of Venezuela s reserves.  Ramirez s next moves were not immediately clear. He did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Authorities appear to be seeking information on Ramirez from Del Pino and Martinez as splits widen in the Socialist Party, which is no longer controlled by the charismatic Chavez, according to one source with knowledge of the detentions.  Del Pino, wearing a Venezuelan national soccer team shirt, was picked up at his Caracas home, according to the source and a photo flashed on state television.  Oil industry sources say Maduro is using the graft probe to sideline political rivals and consolidate his grip on a sector that, despite falling investment and output, brings in more than 90 percent of the cash-strapped country s export income. The unpopular leftist appears to be seeking to shore up his position ahead of a presidential vote in 2018, when he is poised to seek re-election despite an economic crisis that has sparked food shortages and the world s highest inflation.  After surviving major political protests and pushing through a controversial pro-government legislative superbody, Maduro is feeling empowered, according to government insiders and opposition politicians.  To ensure he maintains support, military and political sources say that Maduro, who unlike Chavez does not hail from the army, has handed it more power.       Del Pino and Martinez had been removed from their posts on Sunday and replaced by a major general, giving the already powerful military further clout. The demotion followed the arrest in Caracas last week of six Citgo executives, five of whom are also U.S. citizens, as part of the graft probe, leaving the refiner deprived of much of its top brass.    The men s sidelining also deprives the Venezuelan oil sector of two of its most experienced executives, who were also adamant that the country must keep paying its onerous debt and avoid a debilitating default at all costs. Del Pino did not respond to a Whatsapp message, although his profile picture had changed to one of his children from a photo of him at a PDVSA event with red-shirted workers. ",1.0

 John McCains Opponent Sees Donations Pour In After McCain Blamed Obama For Orlando,"This is why John McCain really regretted blaming President Obama for the Orlando mass shooting.On Thursday, McCain told reporters in a Senate hallway that President Obama is  directly responsible  for the mass shooting in Orlando that resulted in 50 people being killed and 53 people being wounded. Barack Obama is directly responsible for it, because when he pulled everybody out of Iraq, al-Qaeda went to Syria, became ISIS, and ISIS is what it is today thanks to Barack Obama s failures,  McCain said.Reporters gave McCain a fair chance to walk his comments back but he only repeated his claim. He pulled everybody out of Iraq, and I predicted at the time that ISIS would go unchecked, and there would be attacks on the United States of America. It s a matter of record, so he is directly responsible. You can listen to McCain s remarks below:Not long after, McCain issued a statement claiming he  misspoke  even though he made his remarks twice. I misspoke,  McCain said. I did not mean to imply that the President was personally responsible. I was referring to President Obama s national security decisions, not the President himself. As I have said, President Obama s decision to completely withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011 led to the rise of ISIL. I and others have long warned that the failure of the President s policy to deny ISIL safe haven would allow the terrorist organization to inspire, plan, direct or conduct attacks on the United States and Europe as they have done in Paris, Brussels, San Bernardino and now Orlando. Of course, McCain is wrong about President Obama pulling the troops out of Iraq. That was a decision made by President Bush in 2008. President Obama merely honored the agreement signed by the former president.But McCain could be the former Senator from Arizona because of his inflammatory accusation against President Obama.As it turns out, donations have been pouring in for his opponent Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick to the tune of at least $100,000 alone since McCain made the remarks. McCain angered many people with his disrespectful comments about President Obama and so they are responding by supporters his challenger.In addition, a poll touted by Kirkpatrick s campaign in the wake of McCain s remarks shows him losing to her by two points.Kirkpatrick spokesman D.B. Mitchell slammed McCain for his remarks and urged people to help oust him from Congress. John McCain s reckless and appalling comments about the Orlando mass shooting disappointed thousands of Arizonans and people from across the nation,  said Kirkpatrick spokesman D.B. Mitchell.  But his actions are just further proof that after 33 years in Washington McCain has changed, and now Americans are witnessing that he s no longer a  maverick.  Arizonans know it s time for new principled leadership, and that s why Ann Kirkpatrick saw the largest one-day fundraising number of the campaign. We need a senator who will put our national security before partisan politics. We must do everything we can to elect Ann to the Senate and we are asking you to make a donation today. John McCain is currently facing one of the toughest re-election efforts for a Republican this year. Losing his race could very well tip the balance in the Senate and give the majority back to the Democratic Party.You can donate to Kirkpatrick s campaign here.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",0.0

"As of last week, Clinton's White House chances 95 percent: Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation"," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Even before Sunday night'sviciouspresidential debate, Republican Donald Trump was losing ground in many of the states he needs to win to capture the presidency, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation Project analysisreleased on Monday.  The project estimates that if the election had been held at the end of last week, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton had at least a 95 percent chance of winning enough states to reach the minimum 270 Electoral College votes needed to become the next president,based on polling between Sept. 30 and Oct. 7.  _________________________ STATES OF THE NATION What would it take for Donald Trump to turn the map red? _________________________ Those odds had steadily grown from about 60 percent on Sept. 15 to almost 90 percent on Sept 30. In the last four weeks, her estimated margin of victory has grown from about 14 votes to 118, according to the project.  The polling did not capture reaction to Trumps performance in Sundays debate or the release on Friday of his 11-year-old sexually aggressive comments about women.  The results, however, mirrored other estimates of her chances of winning the campaign.  Statistical analysis outfit FiveThirtyEight, for example, put Clintons chance of victory in the election at about 55 percent three weeks ago. Currently, they estimate the odds of a Clinton win at 82 percent. In the same period, the New York Times estimates of the odds of a Clinton victory have also increased, from about 70 percent to 84 percent.  Pennsylvania, Ohio, Nevada and Florida are now leaning toward the Democratic candidate, according to the Reuters/Ipsos project, an online survey of about 15,000 people every week. Arizona and Iowa are in the too-close-to-call category after being considered likely Trump states.  More broadly, the state-by-state results show how Trumps support is sliding. In the last week, he has lost ground in at least 21 states, including in seven of the 18 states where he is leading, while improving his position in 19 states.  Meanwhile, Clinton lost ground in 12 states, including in three of the 23 states where she is leading, and improved her standing in 30 sates.  Based on these results, Trumps best hope for a victory would require a precipitous drop in the number of Democratic voters going to the polls on Nov. 8 from expected levels, combined with a similarly large increase in Republican turnout.  LOCKER-ROOM TALK  Trumpscrude comments about groping women and aggressively pursuing a married woman, captured on an open microphone, have sent his campaign into turmoil.The recording, first reported by The Washington Post, was made in 2005, in advance of a cameo appearance on a soap opera.  Over the weekend, numerous Republican elected officials and candidates responded by calling for Trump to step aside.  Trump responded to his waning support among some Republicans by calling them hypocrites. During Sundays debate he apologized but said the comments were just locker-room talk.  He also attacked Bill Clintons treatment of women and said Hillary Clinton should be in jail for her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Trump said that, if elected, he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate her.  A nearly yearlong FBI investigation into the emails concluded earlier this year that no charges should be filed, although FBI Director James Comey said Clinton had been careless in her handling of sensitive material.  The sexually explicit comments controversy followed published reports suggesting the Republican Party leadership was having an internal debate about shifting resources away from the presidential race and into U.S. House and Senate races.  The Republicans currently control both branches of Congress. Many experts think control of the Senate could shift to the Democrats, although few are predicting the Republicans will lose control of the U.S. House of Representatives.  Even before the weekend, the Trump campaign had struggled through two weeks of negative news coverage that began with the campaigns first presidential debate on Sept. 26, which Reuters/Ipsos polling suggested Clinton had won.  Shortly after the first debate, the New York businessman also attacked  in tweets that began in the early hours of the morning  a former Miss Universe whom Clinton had referred to during the debate as an example of Trump degrading women.  Also during that period, a New York Times report detailed how Trump lost nearly $1 billion in 1995, a loss that could be used to avoid paying federal taxes for up to 18 years, depending on his annual income.  Clinton has had her share of woes as well, including the release of hacked emails last week of comments she appeared to have madeto banks and big business.In the 2014 comments, shepushes for open trade and open borders, and takes a conciliatory approach to Wall Street, both positions she later backed away from.",1.0
" Texas Moving To Ban Jews, Muslims, and Gays from Adopting","Texas parents looking to adopt may soon be banned by private and state-funded agencies that object to people who are Muslim, Jewish, single, gay, or interfaith couples, under a proposal from the Republican-controlled legislature, according to a report by the Associated Press.Similar laws have been passed in five states allowing adoption organizations the ability to refuse gay parents or members of certain religions the right to adopt. The difference is the Texas rule extends the allowable discrimination to state-funded agencies.Republicans say the bill is designed to support foster care provider and adoption agency religious freedom, many which receive funding from the state.Opponents of the proposal are vocal about it robbing children of stable families and using taxpayer dollars to discriminate against hopeful parents. This would allow adopting agencies to turn away qualified, loving parents who are perhaps perfect in every way because the agency has a difference in religious belief. It goes against the best interest of the child.  said the Human Rights Campaign senior legislative counsel, Catherine Oakley. The bill also blatantly violates the Constitution. As a governmental entity, Texas is bound to treat people equally under the law,  states Oakley.  This is a violation of equal protection under the law. An Austin-based attorney Suzanne Bryant who works with LGBTQ clients explains that in addition to using religious freedom to turn away parents looking to adopt, it could also force foster children to comply with these discriminatory requirements.Unfortunately, this could mean welfare organizations have the ability to send LGBTQ children to conversion therapy, which the American Health Organization considers a  serious threat to the health and well-being of affected people.  They could also prevent access to contraception and abortions for young people in the system.This is sad news for hopeful adoptive parents and children in Texas, and a blatant violation of the constitution.Featured image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images",0.0

 Democrats Go On The Attack Against Voter ID Laws,"Virginia s Voter ID law is being challenged in court and with the loss of a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, this might just be the first domino to fall, signaling the end of wide-spread voter suppression by Republicans:(Reuters)   A Virginia law requiring voters to show photo identification goes on trial in federal court on Monday, with Democratic officials claiming it is discriminatory and aimed at keeping party voters from casting ballots.Defenders of the 2013 Virginia law say that it is aimed at preventing voter fraud. The trial, in U.S. district court in Richmond, Virginia, is one of several voting rights legal battles in process as Democrats and Republicans square off ahead of November s presidential election.The Democratic Party of Virginia and two party activists are suing the Virginia State Board of Elections and want Judge Henry Hudson to strike down the law.The problem for the right is that the premise behind these laws has always been a lie. Republicans only became  concerned  with  voter fraud  when it became clear that their white hegemony was in immediate danger. Adding to this problem was the over-the-top way Republicans attacked people s ability to vote. If Voter ID had been a stand alone law, then Republicans MIGHT have been able to maintain the fiction that it was just about voter fraud. However, they also cut voting hours, the number of polling places (but only in Democratic-leaning areas), made the IDs difficult to get and, of course, kept bragging about how it would hurt the Democrats.And just to be absolutely clear that Voter ID laws are bullshit, here s my favorite quote from the New York Times (4/12/2007):Five years after the Bush administration began a crackdown on voter fraud, the Justice Department has turned up virtually no evidence of any organized effort to skew federal elections, according to court records and interviews.Although Republican activists have repeatedly said fraud is so widespread that it has corrupted the political process and, possibly, cost the party election victories, about 120 people have been charged and 86 convicted as of last year.Widespread voter fraud does not exist.The only way for a court to uphold Voter ID is to willfully turn a blind eye to the glaring pattern of voter suppression Republicans have openly laid out. If you re wondering why they were so brazen, it s because they were quite confidant that the Supreme Court would back their partisan attack on democracy. After all, they gutted the Voting Rights Act by claiming, in all seriousness, that racism in America was over and keeping (mostly southern) states from blocking minorities from voting wasn t necessary. Southern states immediately responded by passing laws blocking minorities from voting.Now that Republicans no longer have a friendly SCOTUS to allow their shenanigans, the number of lawsuits against Voter ID and the laundry list of voter suppression tactics is going to grow. According to Yahoo, Kansas and North Carolina s ID laws are also under fire. Not a great time to be a Republican Featured image via onewisconsinnow.org",0.0
New Jersey's 'Bridgegate' defendants executed 'vicious' scheme: prosecutor,"NEWARK, N.J. (Reuters) - Two former allies of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie deliberately closed access lanes to the George Washington Bridge in a vicious and unlawful political revenge scheme, a federal prosecutor said on Friday at the close of their criminal trial. Bridget Kelly, the governors former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, abused their power to create a massive traffic jam in order to punish a local mayor for failing to back Christies re-election campaign, Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee Cortes told jurors in Newark, New Jersey. As cruel and callous as that scheme was, what makes it unlawful was that they misused government resources to carry it out, Cortes said in closing arguments at federal court in Newark, New Jersey. Baronis lawyer is expected to deliver his closing argument later on Friday. The Port Authority operates the George Washington Bridge, said by the agency to be the worlds busiest. Kelly and Baroni are charged with fraud, conspiracy and depriving residents of Fort Lee, New Jersey, of their civil rights. Former Port Authority executive David Wildstein has pleaded guilty and appeared as the governments star witness. Christie has not been charged and has steadfastly denied any advance knowledge of the plan. But Wildstein, Baroni and Kelly all testified that they told the governor some details about the lane closures either beforehand or while they were occurring.  The so-called Bridgegate scandal tarnished Christies national reputation, damaging his unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination. The trial has cast an unflattering light on Christie as a temperamental bully whose administration used the Port Authority to hand out favors, and penalties, to local officials. Kelly and Baroni, both of whom testified in their own defense, said they were duped by Wildstein and his claim that the lane closures were part of a legitimate traffic study. But Cortes warned jurors not to be fooled by that preposterous assertion, pointing to Kellys now-infamous email to Wildstein in which she wrote, Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee, as evidence of her guilt. During his closing argument, Cortes showed jurors numerous messages sent among Kelly, Wildstein and Baroni suggesting they deliberately ignored Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolichs desperate pleas for help as the gridlock became untenable, delaying first responders and stranding school buses for hours. At one point, Wildstein told Baroni that his response to Sokolich should be radio silence. ",1.0

Mexican cement maker ready to help Trump build border wall,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A Mexican cement maker is ready to lend its services to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to build the wall he wants to erect on the southern border of the United States to curb immigration. We cant be choosy, Enrique Escalante, Chief Executive Officer of Grupo Cementos de Chihuahua (GCC) said in an interview. Were an important producer in that area and we have to respect our clients on both sides of the border. Republican Trump campaigned vowing to build a big, beautiful, powerful wall across the 2,000 mile (3,200 km) frontier in order to stop illegal immigrants from Mexico, which he accused of sending rapists and drug traffickers north. The campaign of the New York businessman who has never previously held public office was widely reviled in Mexico. Parts of the border are already divided by high fences, and a huge part of the boundary runs along the Rio Grande river. Based in Chihuahua, a large northern state bordering Texas and New Mexico, GCC is one of the biggest construction materials companies in Mexico. It generates around 70 percent of its sales in the United States, where it also has three plants. Escalante said Trumps plans to invest in energy and infrastructure in the United States augured well for the firm.     For the business were in, Trump is a candidate that does favor the industry quite a bit, Escalante said. GCC, whose shares are trading at their highest levels since 2008, is 23 percent owned by Mexican multinational cement company Cemex, which at the end of September announced plans to sell its stake.

"OBAMA LIES ABOUT Number Of Troops On Ground In IraqFLASHBACK, OBAMA 2009: [Video] After nearly nine years, Americas war in Iraq will be over.","It was more important for Obama to keep a pledge to his leftist donors, than to secure the nation of Iraq before pulling out our troops. And then there s that one little detail rarely discussed in liberal circles, Obama wanted to leave troops behind but the Iraqi government threatened Our Pansy In Chief that they would not give our US troops immunity in their courts. Thus, the master negotiator put his tail between their legs and scooted out of Iraq, bringing our brave men and women in uniform with him Oct. 2011- The U.S. is leaving behind a  sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq, with a representative government. -Barack Huessein ObamaObama claimed it was a  moment of success. The U.S. military has around 5,000 service members in Iraq, officials said on Monday, far more than previously reported, as the Obama administration quietly expands ground operations against the Islamic State.The number of American forces in Iraq has come under increased scrutiny following the death over the weekend of a Marine staff sergeant, the second combat casualty in renewed U.S. operations in Iraq. He was killed when militants launched rockets at a small U.S. base around the city of Makhmour. The existence of the Marine detachment had not been known prior to Staff Sgt. Louis F. Cardin s death.Officials at the Pentagon have declined to specify how Marines are serving at the outpost in northern Iraq, which they described as a satellite base positioned to protect American trainers at a nearby, larger base. Their presence in Iraq highlights the use of forces from Navy ships already in the Middle East. Via: Washington PostObama, Oct. 21, 2011:In a brief appearance at the White House, Mr Obama said:  Today I can report that, as promised, the rest of our troops in Iraq will come home by the end of the year. After nearly nine years, America s war in Iraq will be over. The remaining 40,000 US troops in Iraq, would, he said,  definitely be home for the holidays .He conspicuously declined to repeat the mistake of his predecessor George W Bush, who started the war in March 2003 and displayed a  Mission Accomplished  banner six weeks later, only for Iraq to descend into years of insurgency and sectarian violence that has claimed at least 100,000 civilian lives.Mr Obama however asserted that the  United States is moving forward from a position of strength . The last American soldier will cross the border out of Iraq with their head held high, proud of their service,  he said.The president stressed that he was meeting a withdrawal deadline reached earlier with the Iraqis, as well as keeping a pledge made as a candidate in 2008 to wind down the controversial war as fast as possible.But his statement masked the fact that his administration had wanted to keep a residual force of 4-5,000 beyond the end of the year in a training capacity that would also have acted as a prohibitive presence to neighboring Iran.Despite months of discussions however, it failed to win a continued guarantee of immunity for US troops from prosecution from the Iraqi government.

" Racist, Fascist, White Supremacist: Former NFL Star Chris Kluwe Scorches Trump Over His Attacks On Atheletes","Donald Trump is facing seriously fierce blowback for his attacks on black athletes who choose to protest racism and police brutality by taking a knee during the national anthem before games. Everyone from owners to players to players to former players are giving Trump a big middle finger during Suturday s games on Sunday, and former NFL star Chris Kluwe didn t stay out of the fray. During an interview with CNN host Fredricka Whitfield, Kluwe, who believes he was blacklisted in the league for speaking out for LGBTQ rights, did not hold back. First, Whitfield asked: This display of kneeling at the national anthem on a football field started a year ago with 49er s Kaepernick and now has evolved into something else or perhaps has blossomed into the same thing but in a bigger way. Chris, what statement do you see NFL teams, owners, coaches making when they kneel, touch, lock arms on display like this? Kluwe responded: Well, I think that the players and the teams are saying that they are not going to be dictated to by a racist, fascist white supremacist who currently occupies the highest place in our government. When you look at what Donald Trump has said about speaking out against Nazis, I think it s fantastic that players and owners are now taking a stand in using the platform to speak out against this because this is not what America is. America is not a fascist military state where its devotion to the flag above all. Right now our nation is not holding up its end of the social contract, especially with communities of color. It should be a baseline right now that you can walk down the street and not get shot by a police officer for carrying a toy gun or for selling cigarettes out of the back of a car. It should not be out of the ordinary to expect that. So I m glad to see these players and owners taking a stand. Communities of color within our nation are not receiving the same level of justice that white communities are,  he added.  Black members of our society are far more likely to be put in prison for what white members are able to skate by on. But it s also morphed into a discussion that we have a person in charge of our society that does not understand what it means to wield the American empire, and has shown no willingness to work with minorities, with immigrants, with anyone who is not white, and that is, again, against the heart of what America stands for. Kluwe is spot on. These players do not suspend their First Amendment right when they take to the field. Further, Donald Trump should not be using the bully pulpit of the White House to try and get people fired for demonstrating for justice. These players are using their platforms to bring awareness to a very serious, and literally life or death, issue in America s communities of color. There s nothing more patriotic that they could do.Trump, on the other hand, is no patriot. Kluwe is correct   Trump IS a racist, a fascist, and a white supremacist. Kudos to these sports teams for standing up to this bullying.Watch the video below:Featured image via video screen capture",0.0
BREAKING BOMBSHELL: UNDERCOVER VIDEO Shows NY Dem Elections Official Explain STUNNING Voter Fraud Scams In Minority AreasNo IDsAbsentee Votes,"This video will leave you breathless, as you watch a NY Democrat out the Democrat party and the unbelievable voter fraud the commit. Mayor DeBlasio and Hillary should be sharing a cell together! The Manhattan Democratic representative on the city s Board of Elections was caught on a secret video slamming Mayor Bill de Blasio s municipal ID program as contributing to  all kinds of fraud    including at the polls. He gave out ID cards, de Blasio. That s in lieu of a driver s license, but you can use it for anything,  Commissioner Alan Schulkin said in the undercover video recorded by a muckraker for conservative nonprofit Project Veritas. But they didn t vet people to see who they really are. Anybody can go in there and say,  I am Joe Smith, I want an ID card,  he said in the bombshell tape. It s absurd. There is a lot of fraud. Not just voter fraud, all kinds of fraud . . . This is why I get more conservative as I get older. Schulkin didn t hold back to the undercover journalist, who identified herself as a political consultant at a United Federation of Teachers holiday party on Dec. 16.Not realizing he was being recorded, he broke with his own party s position that voter ID requirements hurt the poor and minorities.Schulkin said he backed the IDs to prevent rampant fraud. The law says you can t ask for anything. Which they really should be able to do,  Schulkin said, according to a copy of the video and transcript provided to The Post. I believe they should be able to do it,  he added.The videographer asked point-blank,  You think they should have voter ID in New York? Schulkin responded,  Voters? Yeah, they should ask for your ID. I think there is a lot of voter fraud. Conservatives claim ID checks help curb voter fraud.Liberal and civil rights groups argue such rules discourage voting and discriminate against minorities and the poor. You know, I don t think it s too much to ask somebody to show some kind of an ID . . . You go into a building, you have to show them your ID,  Schulkin said.While discussing the potential for fraud, Schulkin volunteered that in some parts of the city,  they bus people around to vote . . . They put them in a bus and go poll site to poll site. Asked which neighborhoods, Schulkin said,  I don t want to say. When the undercover mentions black and Hispanic neighborhoods, Schulkin responded,  Yeah . . . and Chinese, too. At another point in the conversation, he discussed potential absentee ballot fraud. Oh, there s thousands of absentee ballots . . . I don t know where they came from,  he said.The undercover offered that  people can cover their faces  to shield their identity when voting, which triggered a conversation about burqas. The Muslims can do that, too. You don t know who they are,  Schulman said. Via: NYP",0.0
Grace Mugabe: the office worker who wanted to rule Zimbabwe,"HARARE (Reuters) - The spectacular rise and fall of Zimbabwe s uncompromising First Lady, Grace Mugabe, had an unusual beginning: an office affair. It was the early 1990s when President Robert Mugabe s eye fell upon one of his shy young typists. She would become his wife, a ferociously ambitious politician and, more than two decades later, a contributor to the downfall of her 93-year-old husband. President Mugabe is trying to cling to power after the military took over this week in response to his purge of vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa, 75, a liberation war fighter and Grace s sworn enemy. Mnangagwa s aides even accused her of trying to poison him with ice cream from her dairy farm this year. She denies this. Grace, now 52 and under house arrest in Harare, had been calling for Mnangagwa s removal for weeks as the two fought an increasingly bitter winner-takes-all contest to succeed the man who has led Zimbabwe since independence from Britain in 1980. It wasn t the first time Grace had wielded influence over her husband. When it appeared former vice president Joice Majuru was in line to succeed Mugabe in 2014, he fired her following public rallies at which Grace derided Majuru. This time she appears to have gone too far. The purge of Mnangagwa and many of his comrades irked the military, who had no intention of allowing Grace and her youthful Generation 40 (G40) faction of the ruling ZANU-PF to take over the political reins. Deeply unpopular among much of the Zimbabwean public due to her alleged corruption and volatile temper, Grace does not have the liberation credentials the military believe are required to be a Zimbabwean ruler. The lavish lifestyle that earned her the nickname  Gucci Grace  and the political ambition that almost propelled her to the presidency were not evident when she met her future husband.  He just started talking to me, asking me about my life,  she told a South African journalist in 2013.  I didn t know it was leading somewhere. I was quite a shy person, very shy.  At the time, they were both married. President Mugabe s wife, Sally, was desperately ill and died in 1992. Grace and Robert were married in 1996 and have three children.  DIS-GRACE  At first Grace stayed out of politics and was better known for her spending habits, including buying mansions in South Africa, rare diamond jewelry, and Rolls-Royce limousines for her playboy sons. Then there are the repeated allegations of violence. In Singapore in 2009, photographer Richard Jones says Grace flew into a rage when he tried to take her picture. She ordered her bodyguards to hold his arms back while she punched him repeatedly in the face. Grace denies the assault. In August this year, Grace was accused of beating a young South African model who was partying with her sons. According to Gabriella Engels, Grace burst into a hotel room where she was talking with friends and whipped her with an electric cable as bodyguards looked on. Grace says she acted in self-defense after Engels tried to stab her with a knife. The reports of lavish spending and explosive temper earned her the title  Dis-Grace  back home in Zimbabwe, where an economic crisis had left most of the 16 million population mired in poverty and unemployment. Zimbabweans also question Grace s credentials. Eyebrows were raised in 2014 when she gained a PhD in three months. Her thesis, on the changing role of the family, has never been published. This hasn t stopped her trying to reach the political summit. When Majuru was removed, Grace became head of the ZANU-PF Women s League, giving her a seat at the party s top table. She used her political platform to take on Mnangagwa and his allies and made a push to succeed her frail husband.  They say I want to be president. Why not? Am I not a Zimbabwean?  Grace said at a recent rally. ",1.0
Philippines' Duterte says no peace talks without communists' ceasefire,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday ruled out a resumption of stalled peace talks with communist rebels if they do not stop guerrilla attacks, two days after lawmakers ousted the last leftist from his cabinet. An angry Duterte in May ordered the scrapping of formal peace talks with the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) after the military said fighters from the CPP s military wing, the New People s Army, stepped up offensives in the countryside.  There will be no talks until you declare a ceasefire, period,  he said in a speech in his home city of Davao.  And if you say you want another war, be my guest.  Duterte gave two cabinet positions to left-wing activists recommended by the CPP when he assumed power last year to show his commitment to ending nearly five decades of conflict, in which more than 40,000 people have been killed. The legislature s Commission on Appointments on Wednesday rejected the appointment of leftist Rafael Mariano as agrarian reform minister.  Mariano s exit came less than a month after the same panel ousted Judy Taguiwalo, another leftist, as social welfare minister, in what some commentators say is a move by Duterte s allies to punish the CPP.  But Duterte s office in both cases expressed disappointment the ministers had not been approved. In the Philippines, all ministers must be approved by the house panel, but the process can take more than a year. The president is furious about repeated attacks by the communist rebels who, he said, have killed many soldiers and police. He is also angered by what he sees as duplicity by the CPP s exiled political leaders, to whom he says he has made many concessions and has shown good faith by making the peace process a top priority for his administration. The rebels  chief negotiator, Luis Jalandoni, has said the government s demand to stop guerrilla attacks is  ridiculous  because soldiers are attacking villages where rebels are based. ",1.0
"Italy lower house passes new electoral law, moves on to Senate","ROME (Reuters) - The Italian Chamber of Deputies on Thursday gave its final approval to a contested electoral law that is likely to penalize the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement in next year s election. The bill, which is supported by the ruling Democratic Party (PD) and mainstream center-right opposition parties, was approved in a secret ballot by 375 votes to 215, and will now move to the upper house Senate for further debate. An election is due by May 2018. Analysts say the new system looks highly unlikely to throw up a clear parliamentary majority, with opinion polls showing the center-left, center-right and 5-Star splitting the vote three ways. The so-called  Rosatellum  law favors parties which group together ahead of the election. The 5-Star refuses to join any alliance and says the reform could cost it at least 50 seats in the next parliament, hobbling its chances of taking power. The party, which tops many opinion polls, has held two days of street protests against what it sees as an attempt by its mainstream rivals to scupper its chances at the election.  You are manipulating the foundations of our democratic system and rigging the rules before the game starts,  5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio told parliament before the vote.   Every single day of the election campaign we will remind people of what you are doing today.  Small left-wing and right-wing parties are also against the bill, which is supported by the center-right Forza Italia (Go Italy!) and the right-wing Northern League. Ettore Rosato, the parliamentary party leader of the PD who has put his name to the reform, said it was the best compromise possible among political adversaries and blamed 5-Star and leftist parties for refusing to join negotiations.  You always said no to everything that we proposed,  he told the Chamber. President Sergio Mattarella has called for new voting rules because he says the current system is too different for the upper and lower houses, meaning it could conceivably throw up conflicting majorities. All previous attempts to harmonize the rules have failed, most recently in June when dissident deputies used a secret vote to up-end part of the proposed legislation. The 5-Star and other opponents of the new rules had hoped that the same would happen in Thursday s final vote in the Chamber, which had already approved the bill in three votes of confidence held with open voting. The package still needs the approval of the upper house Senate, where Gentiloni s government does not have a stable majority. The upper house is expected to begin discussing and voting on the bill next week. ",1.0
"South Korea approves $8 million aid to North Korea, timing to be decided later","SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea approved a plan on Thursday to send $8 million worth of humanitarian aid to North Korea, the South s Unification Ministry said, as part of an aid policy that the government says remains unaffected by geopolitical tensions with the North. The aid decision was made after a meeting of government officials chaired by Unification Minister Cho Myong-gyon. It comes after the United Nations approved new sanctions against North Korea for its sixth nuclear test earlier this month. The South said it aims to send $4.5 million worth of nutritional products for children and pregnant women through the World Food Programme and $3.5 million worth of vaccines and medicinal treatments through UNICEF. The exact timing of when the aid will be sent, as well as its size, will be confirmed later, the ministry said in a statement. The WFP and UNICEF had approached the South Korean government in May and July this year to contribute in aiding North Korea, the statement added.   We have consistently said we would pursue humanitarian aid for North Korea in consideration of the poor conditions children and pregnant women are in there, apart from political issues,  said Cho in opening remarks at the meeting. Ahead of the meeting, UNICEF s regional director for East Asia and the Pacific Karin Hulshof said in a statement the problems North Korean children face  are all too real .  Today, we estimate that around 200,000 children are affected by acute malnutrition, heightening their risk of death and increasing rates of stunting,  Hulshof said.  Food and essential medicines and equipment to treat young children are in short supply.  Cho s ministry had said earlier this month they were looking into giving North Korea aid, which launched a backlash of disapproval from both the public and opposition parties. It has dragged down South Korean President Moon Jae-in s  approval rating. Realmeter, a South Korean polling organization, said on Thursday Moon s approval rating stood at 65.7 percent, weakening for a fourth straight month.  Although the approval rate is still high, those surveyed said Moon had fallen out of favor due to North Korea s continued provocations and the government s decision to consider sending aid to North Korea, Realmeter said. South Korea s decision to mull over fresh aid to the North has also caused a rift of concern in neighboring Japan and the United States, according to government officials there, leading Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to bring up the issue during a phone call with Moon last week.  Moon had said aid was something to be considered separately from political issues, quoted by his office. South Korean humanitarian aid efforts to North Korea had been halted since North Korea s fourth nuclear test in January last year. The last time the South had sent aid to the North was in December 2015 through the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) under ex-president Park Geun-hye. North Korea has conducted two more nuclear tests since then, with its most recent and largest taking place early this month. Pyongyang has launched numerous missiles as well, including two intercontinental ballistic missiles and two other rockets that have flown over Japan. Such provocations have sparked strong disapproval from the international community, especially from the United States and Japan. ",1.0
Court says Republican gerrymandering in Wisconsin was unconstitutional,"MILWAUKEE (Reuters) - Republicans in Wisconsin tilted district maps in their favor in order to hamper Democrats and ultimately win state elections in 2012 and 2014, a federal court said on Monday in a case that could influence future rulings on gerrymandering. The United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin decided 2-1 that Act 43, a redrawing of districts approved by the states Republican-led legislature in 2012, violated the U.S. Constitution, court documents showed.  We find that the discriminatory effect is not explained by the political geography of Wisconsin nor is it justified by a legitimate state interest, the court wrote in its ruling. The case has no bearing on Donald Trumps victory in Wisconsin in the presidential election on Nov. 8, in which he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel said in a statement that he planned to appeal, which would send the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. A ruling there on gerrymandering - the practice of manipulating electoral boundaries for political advantage - could have wide implications across the country as similar cases in Maryland and North Carolina work their way through lower courts.     This is a big victory for those who want to see courts rein in partisan gerrymandering. But it is anybodys guess what happens to this when it gets to the Supreme Court, wrote Richard Hasen, an elections law expert at the University of California, Irvine, on his blog. Since 2010, Republicans have more than doubled their control of state legislatures. They now control both legislative chambers in a record 32 states, the New York Times reported. Republicans win elections because we have better candidates and a better message that continues to resonate with the voters, said Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos in a statement. Twelve Wisconsin voters argued in their lawsuit that Republicans redrew maps in 2011 to divide Democratic voters so they fall short of a majority in districts and to concentrate Democratic voters into districts so they win by overwhelming margins and dilute votes of Democrats statewide, according to the ruling.   Despite receiving 51 percent of the votes statewide in 2012, Democrats won only 39 of 99 Assembly seats. In 2014, Republicans won roughly the same percentage of votes statewide, but won 63 seats, a 24-seat disparity, judges wrote.  The Wisconsin case hinged on a new way to measure the discriminatory effect of gerrymandering. The efficiency gap measure found the redistricting in Wisconsin caused Democrats to waste more votes than Republicans.     The measure gives judges a clear threshold for deciding what is acceptable, Barry Burden, the director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told the New York Times.

Trump to meet with business leaders on infrastructure,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump plans to meet with a group of infrastructure business leaders at the White House on Wednesday, a person briefed on the meeting said. During his presidential campaign, Trump said he would push for a $1 trillion infrastructure program to rebuild roads, bridges, airports and other public works projects. The lunch meeting is set to include real estate, management consulting, private equity and other business leaders, along with at least one environmental group, a person briefed on the matter said. Last month, Trump touted the plan in an address to Congress. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding, Trump said.  To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States - financed through both public and private capital - creating millions of new jobs. The American Society of Civil Engineers has graded U.S. infrastructure at D+ and estimated the country needs to invest $3.6 trillion by 2020. U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao told Fox News last month that the needs for infrastructure are so great the federal government cannot shoulder all the costs. Public private partnerships are a very important part of a new way of financing our roads and bridges that are in disrepair and our very dangerous, Chao said.     In January, Trump signed an executive order aimed at expediting environmental reviews and approvals for all infrastructure projects, especially high priority projects such as improving the U.S. electric grid and telecommunications systems and repairing and upgrading critical port facilities, airports, pipelines, bridges, and highways.

"Sanders meets with Obama, says president will remain neutral in primary race","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders had a rare Oval Office meeting on Wednesday with President Barack Obama, days after Obama praised Hillary Clinton, Sanders rival and front-runner in the race to be the Democratic presidential candidate in the Nov. 8 election. Emerging from the White House after an hour, Sanders said the meeting was constructive and that Obama was trying to be as even-handed as possible in the race, dismissing commentary that Obama was favoring Clinton, his former secretary of state. I know there was some discussion the other day about a Politico interview, where he was tipping the scale toward Secretary Clinton - I dont believe that at all, the Vermont lawmaker told reporters on the White House driveway. While Obama has not explicitly endorsed a candidate, he showered praise on Clintons experience in the interview with Politico while noting that Sanders had the luxury of being a complete long shot. Obama suggested Sanders had not faced intense scrutiny and would need to broaden his populist message to go further in the race for the nomination. The Sanders-Obama meeting came just before the first contests to pick the Democratic and Republican nominees: Iowa, on Monday, and New Hampshire, on Feb. 9. While Sanders has surged in recent opinion polls, Clinton still has the edge nationally. Sanders said he received an overview of foreign policy issues from Obama and that the two talked a little politics. Asked whether Obama, who beat Clinton for the Democratic nomination in 2008, had given him advice on how to defeat her, Sanders laughed and said: No, no. Obama said he had a good meeting with Sanders and noted that he had previously met with Clinton during the campaign. The goal is to make sure that all the Democrats, or folks running in the Democratic primary, are focused on continuing the progress that we have made, Obama said in an interview with an NBC affiliate in Richmond, Virginia. Obama and his aides have regular contact with Clinton and her staff, which includes former Obama White House staffers. Clinton dropped by the White House for an informal lunch on Dec. 7 and had an hourlong chat in March. The White House visitor logs show Sanders making only one previous solo visit with Obama in the Oval Office, on Dec. 15, 2014. The White House said the meeting with Sanders had been in the works since Sanders asked Obama for some face time when he saw him a month ago at a holiday party for lawmakers.

"Top U.S. general, without citing Trump, warns on troops' morale","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. military officer told the Senate on Thursday that it would harm the morale of U.S. forces to order them to carry out activities such as waterboarding or targeting civilians, options previously cited by leading Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, did not comment on U.S. politics, and Trumps name did not come up in a question put to him by Senator Lindsey Graham or in Dunfords response. However, when asked by Graham, a former 2016 White House contender and frequent Trump critic, what the impact such tactics would have on the morale of the force, Dunford said: Those kinds of activities that you described are inconsistent with the values of our nation. And quite frankly I think it would have an adverse effect, citing fallout on the morale of the force. And frankly what you are suggesting are things that actually arent legal for them to do anyway, Dunford added.  During the campaign, Trump indicated that, if elected president, he might order the U.S. military to break the law on interrogation tactics, including waterboarding. Trump also suggested his willingness to target the families of terrorist suspects. Trump, the Republican front-runner, softened his stance on torture earlier in March, saying he would not order the U.S. military to break international laws on how to treat terrorism suspects. Waterboarding is the practice of pouring water over someones face to mimic drowning as an interrogation tactic. Critics say it is torture. Democratic President Barack Obama banned use of the method days after taking office in 2009. ",1.0
 Sanders Fans Break Fundraising Site After NH Primary Win (VIDEO/TWEETS),"After Bernie Sanders  win in New Hampshire on Tuesday night, so many people contributed to his campaign that ActBlue, the fundraising service used by Democratic candidates, is having trouble processing the donations. That s because during his victory speech, Sanders said: I m not going to New York City to host a fundraiser on Wall Street. Instead, I m going to hold a fundraiser right here, right now, across America. My request is please go to BernieSanders.com and contribute. So there it is, that s our fundraiser. Pretty quick,  Sanders concluded. That  fundraiser  brought in more than $5.1 million dollars in one night for Sanders.  It was a Yuuuge night for the Democratic candidate.Here is the victory speech that broke the internet:Sanders supporters took to Twitter to complain that their contributions were not going through. Act Blue is doing the best they can to deal with the new flood of donations being sent to Sanders.Huge night! Contributions are processing, receipts are a little delayed. Keep the donations coming!!  ActBlue (@actblue) February 10, 2016Our customer service team is always available for support. Just email [email protected] and someone will get back to you.  ActBlue (@actblue) February 10, 2016 ActBlue laid out what happened to cause the issues, in a blog post: Last night s spontaneous fundraiser (the one that raised $5.2 million in less than a day) broke our external processor s response systems. That s some amazing grassroots power. Like we said, we over-prepare, so we were ready for that. But the vendor started giving us a previously undocumented error message, which temporarily caused some donors to not move from the  please wait  page to the confirmation page even though their contributions were already fully processed As a certain hilarious SNL skit pointed out, we all know that Bernie Sanders  average campaign donation is $27 dollars. The people-powered campaign has already smashed President Obama s previous record for the highest number of contributions. The fact that people are making smaller donations to Sanders  campaign gives the candidate a huge advantage in terms of grassroots fundraising. Since very few people have donated the maximum amount they can, supporters can continue to donate to Sanders  campaign throughout the primary season.That might have something to do with why Sanders  raised more money than Hillary Clinton s campaign in January. In January, Sanders received $20 million dollars in donations, while Clinton raised $15 million dollars.Rest assured, anxious Berners.  The campaign s site is up and running and this shouldn t be a problem anymore. Be happy, this is  probably the best problem any candidate could ever have during an election.Featured image from video screenshot via YouTube",0.0
UK PM May says Donald Trump was wrong to retweet far-right videos,"AMMAN (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump was wrong to retweet a video from a far-right British group which she said was hateful and spreads division. Trump sparked outrage in Britain with a sharp rebuke of May on Twitter after she criticized him for retweeting anti-Islam videos from the deputy leader of Britain First. The fact that we work together does not mean that were afraid to say when we think the United States has got it wrong, and be very clear with them, May told reporters in Amman. And Im very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do, May said. ",1.0
Trump nominates businessman with Asia background as Navy secretary,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday nominated Philip Bilden, a former military intelligence officer and private equity executive with broad experience of Asia, particularly China, as the civilian head of the U.S. Navy. Trump has vowed to build up the U.S. Navy to 350 ships from the current 290, a move aides say is aimed at countering Chinas rapid rise as a military power in the Asia-Pacific. The Trump administration on Monday raised the prospect of worsening tensions with China when it vowed to prevent Beijing from taking over territory in international waters in the South China Sea, something Chinese state media has warned would require Washington to wage war. Bilden emerged recently as a favorite for the position of Navy secretary over the early front-runner, former U.S. Representative Randy Forbes, a leading critic of China who chaired the House Armed Services Seapower Subcommittee. Bildens nomination, which must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, follows that of another businessman, Vincent Viola, an Army veteran and founder of a high-speed trading firm, to be secretary of the Army. Neither Bilden or Viola has experience in government. A White House statement described Bilden as a highly successful business leader, former Military Intelligence officer, and Naval War College cybersecurity leader. It said he would bring strategic leadership, investment discipline, and Asia-Pacific regional and cyber expertise to the Department of the Navy. Maintaining the strength, readiness, and capabilities of our maritime force is critical to our national security, Bilden said in the White House statement.  If confirmed, I will ensure that our Sailors and Marines have the resources they need to defend our interests around the globe and support our allies with commitment and capability. Retired Admiral James Stavridis, a former NATO supreme commander, said Bilden was an excellent choice. (He) is deeply knowledgeable about China, but I would not say he is close to China. Many times he has spoken to me about the need to take a firm line in the South China Sea, he told Reuters. James Carafano, at the Heritage Foundation think tank said Bilden had a deep knowledge of cyber threats, and understands the threat posed by rising naval powers such as China. The administration statement said Bilden served in the U.S. Army Reserve as an intelligence officer from 1986 to 1996. He recently retired as a co-founding member of HarbourVest, a global private-equity firm having established its Asian presence in Hong Kong. He is a director of the U.S. Naval Academy Foundation and a trustee of the Naval War College Foundation, where he chairs the Center for Cyber Conflict Studies. ",1.0
IS IVANKA TRYING TO CONVINCE Her Father To Break One Of His Key Campaign Promises?,"Watch this video compilation where Trump makes his stance on man-made global climate change very clear: As President Donald Trump contemplates whether to make good on his campaign promise to yank the United States out of the Paris climate accord, an unlikely lobbying force is hoping to talk him out of it: oil and coal producers.A pro-Paris bloc within the administration has recruited energy companies to lend their support to the global pact to cut greenhouse gas emissions, according to two people familiar with the effort who asked not to be identified.Cheniere Energy Inc., which exports liquefied natural gas, became the latest company to weigh in for the pact to cut greenhouse gas emissions in a letter Monday to White House energy adviser G. David Banks. Domestic energy companies are better positioned to compete globally if the United States remains a party to the Paris agreement,  Cheniere wrote. The accord  is a useful instrument for fostering demand for America s energy resources and supporting the continued growth of American industry. Exxon Mobil Corp., previously led by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc also have endorsed the pact.The industry campaign to stick with the Paris accord comes amid deep divisions in the Trump administration over the carbon-cutting agreement. Both the president s daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, a White House special adviser, have urged the president to stay in the deal, along with Tillerson.Climate scientists who are against the climate treaty have written an open letter to President Trump:Breitbart News reports that in an open letter to Donald Trump, climate expert Dr. Duane Thresher has urged the President not to give in to his daughter Ivanka s misguided views on global warming and her insistence that the U.S. remain in the Paris climate agreement ratified by Barack Obama last August. Climate treaties like the Paris Agreement have little to do with climate,  Thresher notes in his letter, which he made available to Breitbart News.  They are about economic competition. As the greatest economy in the history of the world, other countries will do anything to cripple the United States. Countries like China will agree to anything in these treaties and simply ignore their obligations while demanding the United States fulfill theirs,  Thresher said, calling belief in global warming a  popular delusion. In his letter, Dr. Thresher also reminded President Trump of his campaign promises that led many Americans to vote for him. We who voted for you consider stopping this climate change madness one of your key promises,  Thresher said.  If you renege on it you will lose me and many others as supporters. After Trump s election, in fact, a number of climate change skeptics were emboldened to take more public stands against the politically imposed  scientific consensus  of global warming, welcoming a new era of free debate about a hotly contested issue.Scientists unconvinced by the party line on climate change applauded Trump s appointment of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to head up the Environmental Protection Agency as an important step away from climate alarmism.Even if Trump caves and stays in the Paris climate agreement, Thresher says, it won t win him any friends.  Your opponents are not going to support you; they ll just taunt you as being a flip-flopper,  he said.",0.0

 Londons New Muslim Mayor Has Some VERY Choice Words For Donald Trump (VIDEO),"While the United States has as one of its presumptive party nominees a raging bigot who clearly hates Muslim individuals, even going so far as to say that if he were to become president he would ban Muslims from entering the nation, London has just elected a Muslim mayor.Now that Sadiq Khan has been elected mayor of London, he has some very choice words for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.Khan, being the son of Pakistani immigrants himself, is none to pleased with Trump s divisive rhetoric surrounding the Islamic faith. And it s true that if the United States is to embody freedom, especially religious freedom, Trump needs to be educated on what that actually is, and Khan seems more than willing to provide that education.Half joking, Khan said: I ll need to rush to come to America before November, because if Trump wins, I ll be banned from coming. But in an interview with Time magazine, he was much more serious with his remarks. If Donald Trump becomes the president, I ll be stopped from going there by virtue of my faith, which means I can t engage with American mayors and swap ideas. Conservative tacticians thought those sorts of tactics would win London and they were wrong. I m confident that Donald Trump s approach to politics won t win in America. In yet another interview, after hearing Trump congratulated him on his victory, Khan said: My point to Donald Trump is, don t make an exception for me. Reconsider your views on Islam. Driving the point home, also hoping to  educate  Trump, Khan told BBC: This isn t just about me. It s about my friends, my family and everyone who comes from a background similar to mine, anywhere in the world. Imagine if the world were to judge all Americans by the words and actions of Donald Trump. That s exactly what Trump does when he judges an entire religion by an extremist few who claim they are of the Islamic faith, but yet clearly are just sociopaths.Trump s rhetoric is not only bad for the United States, it s bad for the entire world. How is a man, who wants to be leader of the free world, supposed to do so by condemning all people of the world s second largest religion?Watch some of Khan s comments here:Featured image via video screen capture  Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",0.0

Trump weighs recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital: officials,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is considering recognition of Jerusalem as Israels capital, a move that could upend decades of American policy and ratchet up Middle East tensions, but is expected to again delay his campaign promise to move the U.S. embassy there, U.S. officials said on Thursday. After months of intense White House deliberations, Trump is likely to make an announcement next week that seeks to strike a balance between domestic political demands and geopolitical pressures over an issue at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  the status of Jerusalem, home to sites holy to the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions. Trump is weighing a plan under which he would declare Jerusalem the capital of Israel, the officials said, deviating from White House predecessors who have insisted that it is a matter that must be decided in peace negotiations. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, and the international community does not recognize Israels claim on the entire city. Such a move by Trump, which could be carried out through a presidential statement or speech, would anger the Palestinians as well as the broader Arab World and likely undermine the Trump administrations fledgling effort to restart long-stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. It could, however, help satisfy the pro-Israel, right-wing base that helped him win the presidency and also please the Israeli government, a close U.S. ally. Trump is likely to continue his predecessors policy of signing a six-month waiver overriding a 1995 law requiring that the U.S. Embassy be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the officials said. But among the options under consideration is for Trump to order his aides to develop a longer-term plan for the embassys relocation to make clear his intent to do so eventually, according to one of the officials. However, the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, cautioned that the plan has yet to be finalized and Trump could still alter parts of it. No decision has been made on that matter yet, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Thursday. Trump pledged on the presidential campaign trail last year that he would move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. But Trump in June waived the requirement, saying he wanted to maximize the chances for a peace push led by his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.  Those efforts have made little if any progress. The status of Jerusalem is one of the major stumbling blocks in achieving peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem during the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it, a move not recognized internationally.  Palestinian leaders, Arab governments and Western allies have long urged Trump not to proceed with the embassy relocation, which would go against decades of U.S. policy by granting de facto U.S. recognition of Israels claim to all of Jerusalem as its capital. However, if Trump decides to declare Jerusalem as Israels capital, even without ordering an embassy move, it would be certain to spark an international uproar.  A key question would be whether such a declaration would be enshrined as a formal presidential action or simply be a symbolic statement by Trump. Some of Trumps top aides have privately pushed for him to keep his campaign promise to satisfy a range of supporters, including evangelical Christians, while others have warned of the potential damage to U.S. relations with Muslim countries.

Rohingya Muslims trapped after Myanmar violence told to stay put,"SITTWE, Myanmar (Reuters) - Thousands of Rohingya Muslims trapped by hostile Buddhists in northwestern Myanmar have enough food and will not be granted the safe passage they requested from two remote villages, a senior government official said on Tuesday. The Rohingya villagers said they wanted to leave but needed government protection from ethnic Rakhine Buddhists who had threatened to kill them. They also said they were running short of food since Aug. 25, when Rohingya militants launched deadly attacks in Rakhine state, provoking a fierce crackdown by the Myanmar military. At least 420,000 Rohingya have since fled into neighboring Bangladesh to escape what a senior United Nations official has called a  textbook example of ethnic cleansing . Tin Maung Swe, secretary of the Rakhine state government, said requests from the two villages for safe passage had been denied, since they had enough rice and were protected by a nearby police outpost.  Their reasons were not acceptable,  he said.  They must stay in their original place.  Residents of Ah Nauk Pyin, one of the two Rohingya villages, said they hoped to move to the relative safety of a camp outside Sittwe, the nearby state capital. About 90,000 Rohingya displaced by a previous bout of violence in 2012 are confined to camps in Rakhine in squalid conditions. But such a move was  impossible,  said state secretary Tin Maung Swe, since it might anger Rakhine Buddhists and further inflame communal tensions. In a nationally televised speech on Tuesday, Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi vowed to punish the perpetrators of human rights violations in Rakhine, but did not address U.N. accusations of ethnic cleansing by the military. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate said that many Muslims had not fled and urged foreign diplomats to study why certain areas of Rakhine state had  managed to keep the peace .  We can arrange for you to visit these areas and to ask them for yourself why they have not fled ... even at a time when everything around them seems to be in a state or turmoil,  she said. The Rohingya residents of Ah Nauk Pyin say they have no other choice but to stay, and their fraught relations with equally edgy Rakhine neighbors could snap at any moment. About 2,700 people live in Ah Nauk Pyin, which sits half-hidden among fruit trees and coconut palms on a rain-swept peninsula.  Its residents said that Rakhine men have made threatening phone calls and recently congregated outside the village to shout,  Leave, or we will kill you all . On Tuesday morning, Rakhine villagers chased away two Rohingya men trying to tend to their fields, said Maung Maung, the leader of Ah Nauk Pyin. The Rakhine deny harassing their Muslim neighbors, but want them to leave, fearing they might collaborate with militants from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), which carried out the Aug. 25 attacks. Khin Tun Aye, chief of Shwe Laung Tin, one of the nearby Rakhine villages, said they had chased away the two Rohingya men in case they were  planning to attack or blow up our village .  They shouldn t come close during this time of conflict situation. People are living in constant fear,  he said. The Office of the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Myanmar told Reuters it was  aware and concerned  about the situation and was discussing it with the Myanmar government. State secretary Tin Maung Swe said Reuters could not visit the area for security reasons, but said the authorities were assessing needs of those living there.  If they need food, we are ready to send it,  he said.  Don t worry about it.  ",1.0
MICHELLE OBAMA Wanted Biden To Run So He Could Beat Hillary [Video],"Has their ever been a more vengeful and hateful First Lady?They are the elite group of women who occupy the East Wing of the White House as their husbands serve as presidents of the United States.Viewed as  the true modern power brokers of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , the first ladies have had different takes on their public positions and either love the proximity to the country s top policy advisers or view it as serving a prison term of teas, luncheons, dinners and photo ops.There are friendships among this sorority of first ladies and turbulent rivalries as well as  relationships fraught with hurt feelings and resentment, like that between Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama , Kate Andersen Brower writes in her new book, First Women, the Grace and Power of America s Modern First Ladies, published by Harper. The 2008 presidential campaign left deep and lasting scars on both the Clinton and the Obama camps, and they are still shockingly fresh. Michelle, now 52, never forgot how Hillary mocked her husband s message of  hope and change  at a campaign rally in Ohio during that campaign. The sky will open, the light will come down, celestial choirs will be singing, and everyone will know that we should do the right thing, and the world would be perfect,  Clinton said.Watch Hillary starting at the 45 second mark:Hillary was right; that certainly didn t happen and she has remained bitter for years that Senator Ted Kennedy, who had been her mentor in the Senate, did not support her presidential candidacy in 2008.A source in Hillary s inner circle told the author that Hillary, now 68, is running again for president out of vengeance for that loss. She needs to win.Obama is viewed by Hillary s circle of people as not having the same work ethic as Hillary who they see as having a long record of dedicated public service.Those Clinton acolytes also suggest that  Michelle has not done enough as first lady  and has failed to prioritize funding for some programs that subsequently lost their federal support.One such program was Save America s Treasures, a program that Hillary started to help preserve and protect historic sites, arts and published works and was lovingly carried on by Laura Bush, the next first lady.Michelle felt no such obligation to those treasures and let the program dissolve.Michelle s feelings towards Hillary were blatantly obvious when no couple dinners were scheduled at the Obama White House while Hillary was secretary of state and frequently meeting with the President.Michelle is very close to Jill Biden and Vice President Joe Biden. She was hoping that Biden would run against Hillary for the Democratic nomination and his win would take away the sweet taste of victory once again for Hillary. Via: Daily Mail ",0.0

 Twitter Goes Nuts After President Obama Accomplishes Yet Another First,"Long before becoming President of the United States, Barack Obama was a constitutional law professor, and even before that, he was the editor of the Harvard Law Review. In other words, he knows his way around academic writing, and on Monday, he became the first sitting president to ever publish in an academic journal.Obama s article, called United States Health Care Reform, has a modest byline of  Barack Obama, JD,  for Juris Doctorate. In other words, for all the Republicans accusing the President of arrogance, the President didn t even tout the fact that he s the leader of the free world. It was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, and it stresses the importance of the Affordable Care Act, along with the need to improve on his signature legislation.Twitter loved it. There are few busier people in the world than Barack Obama, yet he finds time to do something no other sitting president has done. That s pretty impressive, as is the impassioned case for improving Obamacare. He even wants to include a public option:Policy makers should build on progress made by the Affordable Care Act by continuing to implement the Health Insurance Marketplaces and delivery system reform, increasing federal financial assistance for Marketplace enrollees, introducing a public plan option in areas lacking individual market competition, and taking actions to reduce prescription drug costs. Although partisanship and special interest opposition remain, experience with the Affordable Care Act demonstrates that positive change is achievable on some of the nation s most complex challenges.Here are just a few of the tweets under the hashtag #ObamaJAMA:President publishes scholarly article.

OBAMAS WAR ON COPS Takes Toll On Black Communities: Young Girl Cries Over #BlackLivesMatter Violence In Her Milwaukee Neighborhood [VIDEO],"Communities like Ferguson, Baltimore and now Milwaukee, didn t ask for this war on cops, it was thrust upon them. It was organized, paid for and well-orchestrated by Obama and other Democrats players from a variety of backgrounds. Former Attorney General Eric Holder was caught paying protesters with taxpayer money to come to Sanford, FL to march against George Zimmerman in the Trayvon Martin case that got Obama s Race War/War on Cops started back in March, 2012. With so many stories about the violence and crime coming out of Milwaukee, a bright ray of hope comes from a prayer rally created by a community torn apart by Obama s war on cops.A young girl bravely speaks out against the violence in her neighborhood. The sadness and despair in her shaking voice is truly heartbreaking. These people are trapped in a neighborhood overrun with crime, violence and despair. They re trapped in a neighborhood run by greedy Democrat politicians who have substituted government control for self-respect and dignity. They have taken away these citizens desire to do better, they have stripped them of the belief that they truly can escape their situation. They ve set up Planned Parenthood abortion mills on every corner to keep their population down and have given them just enough to sustain themselves, but not too much to escape government control.Rotten school officials and union leaders tasked with improving their education are only out for themselves, always looking for the next pay raise or special perk that comes with the job. What these self-serving politicians and school administrators are giving to these communities of mostly fatherless kids are a poor education, low self-esteem and no hope for a better life.These young adults are choosing a life of crime over a job. They re choosing to drop out of school instead of getting a job at a local fast-food restaurant while attending a local community college or technical training center. These young adults don t know, or understand the value of sacrificing today for a future tomorrow, because the Democratic Party has convinced them they don t need to worry about the future. They ve convinced them they don t need to be self-sufficient. The only thing they need is the government and that s enough. That s also the reason this frightened little girl seen in the video below, is trapped in this tragic neighborhood filled with violence and crime and may never get out as long as Democrats continue to fool the voters in these crime-ridden cities they are on their side.Thank goodness these citizens, (who are truly a ray of hope in these uncertain times) are able to turn to God for guidance and to ask for protection for their community, and for law enforcement officers who keep their neighborhoods safe.

Colombia urgently crafting law to allow crime gangs to surrender,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia s government is urgently working with Congress on a law that would lay out terms of surrender for crime gangs such as the Gulf Clan, President Juan Manuel Santos said on Thursday, after the gang declared a unilateral ceasefire. The Gulf Clan, also known as the Usuga Clan and the  Autodefensas Gaitanistas, has been accused of operating drug trafficking routes in partnership with Mexican cartels and taking part in illegal gold mining. It announced a ceasefire on Wednesday and has said its members were willing to turn themselves in. Santos, speaking at a event about the eradication of coca crops in Antioquia province, hailed the ceasefire and said a surrender of the group would be welcome, but added that security forces will not halt actions against the group.   If this organization wants to surrender to justice it s very welcome and we re working with the justice minister to put together some decrees and there s a law in Congress to facilitate the collective surrender of the Gulf Clan that we are classing as urgent,  Santos said. The president has said the government will not negotiate with the group because members are criminals and not politically motivated rebels like the now-demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) or National Liberation Army (ELN). Defense Minister Luis Carlos Villegas, speaking at the same event, said operations against the Clan will continue.  The fact that they won t shoot is good news but if they continue to commit crimes they will be targeted,  he said.  We are not going to suspend operations or lower our guard.  ",1.0
 Conservatives Are Going BONKERS Over the Indictment Of The Fake Baby Parts Video People (SCREENSHOTS),"In case you haven t heard, after Texas Governor Greg Abbott ordered an investigation into Planned Parenthood after disingenuous, heavily-edited videos were produced by the deceptively-named Center For Medical Progress. The videos, which claimed the women s health organization sold  baby parts  to the highest bidder, launched a wave of investigations nationwide   all of which turned up absolutely no wrongdoing on the part of Planned Parenthood.One such investigation in Texas involved Planned Parenthood of the Gulf Coast. Though a grand jury cleared the much-maligned institution of any and all wrongdoing, two indictments were handed down   against the producers of the anti-Planned Parenthood fabrications.David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt were both indicted for Tampering with a Governmental Record. In addition, Daleiden received an indictment for Prohibition of the Purchase and Sale of Human Organs   an incredibly serious charge. We were called upon to investigate allegations of criminal conduct by Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast,  said Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson.  As I stated at the outset of this investigation, we must go where the evidence leads us. All the evidence uncovered in the course of this investigation was presented to the grand jury. I respect their decision on this difficult case. The people behind this fraud lied and broke the law in order to spread malicious lies about Planned Parenthood to advance their extreme anti-abortion political agenda,  Planned Parenthood said in a statement.  As the dust settles and the truth comes out, it s become totally clear that the only people who engaged in wrongdoing are the criminals behind this fraud, and we re glad they are being held accountable. Nothing about today s announcement in Harris County impacts the state s ongoing investigation,  said Governor Abbott, who promised to continue to waste state money in fruitless attempts to smear the women s health group.  The State of Texas will continue to protect life, and I will continue to support legislation prohibiting the sale or transfer of fetal tissue. The horrific nature of these videos demand scrutiny and investigation. The Senate Committee on Health and Human Services will continue to examine the practices of abortion providers and whether state law adequately protects the sanctity of life,  Lt. gov. Dan Patrick added. I will never be deterred from standing up to fight to protect the unborn. Daleiden s supporters similarly don t care about the facts, with many demanding an investigation into the grand jury because they can t possibly think that laws were broken when the Center for Medical Progress illegally recorded privileged information and slopping edited clips together to give the impression of wrongdoing   no matter what the evidence says. On Fox News  Facebook page, they let their  thoughts  (we use that word loosely) be known:               It s important to remember that these people will be voting in November.Featured image via screengrab",0.0

Stock futures dip after North Korea nuclear test,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. equity index futures dipped at the open on Sunday, as stock traders showed caution following news that North Korea had escalated diplomatic tensions by conducting what it said was a test of a hydrogen bomb. S&P 500 e-mini futures were down 0.36 percent, after electronic trading resumed on Sunday evening. The dip showed that traders were cautious but not overly spooked by news out of North Korea. Volumes were higher than normal, with 30,200 contracts changing hands.  Traders have been burned by overreacting to the news out of North Korea multiple times over the last month   most recently after missiles were shot over Japanese territory,  said Nicholas Young, a partner at Conventus Capital LLC in New York on Sunday.  Unless we get a real response from the U.S., the market seems desensitized to these items.   The 10-year Treasury futures were up 0.16 percent on Sunday. North Korea on Sunday conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test, which it said was of an advanced hydrogen bomb for a long-range missile, in a dramatic escalation of Pyongyang s stand-off with the United States and its allies.

Czechs pin hopes on billionaire Babis to fix their country,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - The traffic jams and roadworks that snarl the 200 km main highway from the capital Prague to the southeast are a symbol of how many Czechs feel their government is broken - and how they are looking for a new champion to fix it. A ring road around Prague is nowhere near completion after decades of zoning setbacks, a rail link to Prague s airport has been debated for 20 years without a shovel going in the ground.  The World Bank ranks the country 130th in the world when it comes to efficiency in issuing building permits, the worst in the European Union. In the Oct 20-21 election, voters look set to hand power to a man who says he can sort it all out: billionaire businessman Andrej Babis, whose anti-establishment rhetoric is reminiscent of U.S. President Donald Trump.   I see results, the others are only talkers,  said Erwin Heinl after meeting Babis at a pensioners club in Varnsdorf, 125 km (75 miles) north of Prague.  It is the only possible choice.  The central European country joined the EU in 2004 and has made great strides in economic development. But people feel wages and public services have been slow to catch up with the richer West while business sharks made billions in often murky privatizations and public contracts.  Babis, whose ANO party is far ahead of rivals in the polls, has been able to sell himself as a man fighting obstacles from coalition partners, while taking credit for popular decisions such as pension hikes during his time as finance minister. The bet on Babis is not straightforward. As the second richest Czech, he grew his chemicals, food and media empire in the same environment he and voters criticize. He is also not a new face, having governed as junior partner to the center-left Social Democrats since 2014.   Social Democrats still stand for the old rule and ANO is a symbol of the new rule, hence its credit for the economic success, government stability and so on,  said Daniel Prokop from the Median polling agency.  Many people respect Babis for his business approach to management which he says politicians lack.  He is skillful as a businessman, he could show that also running the state,  Karina Brtinska, 63, said after meeting Babis at a campaign stop at the main square in Varnsdorf. His successes include a budget surplus last year. Babis, as finance minister until May this year before he was removed by the prime minister, raised revenue by introducing value-added tax cross-checks and real-time reporting of shop sales.  But the budget was chiefly helped by economic growth, low interest rates, and a drop in public investments resulting from issues such as slow preparation of road building that meant less spending.  His ANO has held the Transport Ministry for the past four years. Czechs built close to 160 km of highways in the past 10 years, compared with 2,300 km in Poland 250 km in Slovakia.  The Czechs also pledged to raise defense spending, but under ANO running the Defence Ministry it dropped below 1 percent of GDP before a small pick up this year, still far away from the NATO goal of 2 percent.  Babis has also shaken off the impact of investigation for alleged fraud in tapping a 2 million euro subsidy - a charge that could carry a jail sentence. He denies any wrongdoing and portrays it as an attempt by adversaries to block him from sweeping out graft.  He is not afraid of anyone. He is honest,  said Anna Havelkova, an ANO supporter in Varnsdorf. Babis put his Agrofert group of more than 250 companies into a trust fund this year but remains the fund s beneficiary. Agrofert has been receiving farming and investment subsidies and also has numerous deals with the public sector, raising criticism from rivals and media of conflicts of interests.  Babis had acknowledged having conflicts of interest prior to moving Agrofert to the trust funds but said he never abused it.  Forbes puts Babis s net worth at 88 billion crowns ($4.01 bln), up from 40 billion in 2013 just before he joined the government. ANO voters are also unfazed by Babis  membership of the Communist party before a democratic revolution in 1989, or his contacts with secret police at the time.  Success is always accompanied by envy. Everyone has a past, but I am interested in the present. He has a vision and I believe he can fulfill it,  said businessman Slavomir Svitana attending Babis  rally in downtown Prague.    ",1.0
 WATCH: Joy Reid OWNS Trump In Less Than 30 Seconds For Claiming To Be More Popular Than Obama,"Joy Reid rained on Donald Trump s parade on Sunday morning, and it was glorious.Earlier in the morning, Trump declared on Twitter that his poll numbers are better than President Obama s and posted about how Rasmussen, a conservative leaning polling firm, has his approval rating at 50 percent.The new Rasmussen Poll, one of the most accurate in the 2016 Election, just out with a Trump 50% Approval Rating.That s higher than O s # s!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2017Well, AM Joy host Joy Reid quickly destroyed Trump with a smile and some snark. Trump also tweeted about his poll numbers this morning, citing a new poll that puts his approval rating at 50 percent and saying that s higher than O s numbers,  Reid said before pointing out that Trump is obsessed with Obama.  Obsessed with President Obama much?  she continued.Reid then noted that other polls have Trump s approval rating much lower than Rasmussen. In fact, his rating is the lowest in history. The only poll showing Trump at 50 percent was Rasmussen, which Reid trashed. See if you can spot the outlier,  she asked the audience.Here s the video via VidMe.Donald had better see someone quickly about that burn.But it s even worse for him because his claim is not even close to being accurate. As it turns out, President Obama s approval rating on June 18, 2009 was 55 percent. And the polling firm that reported that finding happens to be Rasmussen, the same polling firm Trump is bragging about now. And last time I checked, 55 is still bigger than 50. That means Trump s claim that he has a higher number than Obama is totally false.Reid is right about Trump being obsessed with President Obama. Trump has tried to destroy Obama s legacy at every turn and he is constantly claiming to be a better president even though he has been a complete disaster for this country. Trump legislative record is laughable since the only bills he signs are minor ones that designate buildings and other little things that don t really matter. He has not signed a single piece of major legislation yet, and he is been in office over 100 days already.Mostly, he has been signing executive orders, which Trump and conservatives repeated whined about Obama doing. Trump is on pace to sign more executive orders than Obama ever did. Furthermore, Trump is also on pace to take more vacation days and play more rounds of golf in a single year than Obama ever did.Trump is an embarrassment to this nation and his poll numbers are only going to get worse once his supporters begin to truly realize that they have been duped.Featured Image: Screenshot",0.0

 Melania Just Liked A Tweet That Shows Just How Much She Hates Her Husband (DETAILS),"There has long been speculation that Melania Trump cannot stand her husband. After all, Donald Trump is a bloviating, compulsive bully. If he bullies the rest of the world, chances are he does the same to his wife. What s to stop him? He likely controls her money and her access to her son. If she tried to speak out against him or leave him, she d lose both. Hell, he might even be able to get her deported.There s plenty of evidence out there that Melania is terrified of The Donald, but it seems she may be getting bolder. There is, thus far, absolutely no sign that she and her son, Barron, are planning to move to the White House. The only time we see them is at a few photo-ops, and when the family travels to Mar-a-Lago. She never says a word to the press, and has not executed any of the usual duties of a First Lady. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that Melania s official Twitter account liked a tweet that mocks Trump s border wall plan, saying that the only wall he s been able to build is between himself and his wife. Here is a screenshot of that particular like, in case someone pulls it down:Now, this is a pretty bold move for Melania, and kudos to her or whoever had the guts to do it. As much as Trump is on Twitter, it s likely he d see it, especially as it gets spread around the interwebs. Hopefully, he s too busy attacking political opponents, the free press, and anyone else who dares to criticize him to attack his own wife. Then again, knowing Trump, he won t be able to restrain himself.Melania, I hope you ve got good security after this one. But thanks for confirming what we already knew: You hate that man as much as we do.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",0.0
DEAL WITH IT: YOULL LOVE WHAT TRUMP CHOSE TO SYMBOLIZE His Love For America In TIME Magazine Interview [VIDEO],"Trump s not backing down from his  in your face  style anytime soon. That s the problem with our country, we don t have fighters in our country. And his critics are just gonna have to  deal with it. Donald Trump is on the cover of Time magazine, and the headline reads:  Deal with it. The meme-worthy photo shoot features the Republican presidential hopeful posing with a 27-year-old American bald eagle   the emblem of the United States. Every frame was the same,  Schoeller told TIME.  Mr. Trump knows exactly how he looks, and he strikes one pose and doesn t move. The same could not be said for 27-year-old Uncle Sam, who was hit by a car in the 1990s and has since segued into a life on the educational and entertainment circuits. He s very difficult to photograph,  said Schoeller.  If you ask him to look up a little bit, he says no or he just doesn t do it. He literally has one angle. If I ask him to smile, he puts on a big grin and then he goes back to his Zoolander  blue steel  look. The  blue steel  look appears, sans eagle, on the cover of this week s TIME.It s a look America has grown very accustomed to since Trump became a household name in the 1980s and one they ve been showing their love for more than ever in recent months.The Republican front-runner said it all on Wednesday that when it comes to the polls in the crowded 2016 presidential race,  the only thing constant is Trump. Asked at a news conference ahead of a town-hall forum in New Hampshire who he saw as his strongest rival in the crowded Republican field, Trump said:  You know it changes. The only thing constant is Trump.  Via: UK Daily Mail They re going up and down like yo-yos,  he said of his Republican rivals.  But I ve been up there for a long time and I hope I m going to be up there for a long time. Saying he had seen newspaper reports that he would grow tired of the presidential race, Trump said:  I m not going anywhere folks. I m not doing this for my health. I m doing this to make America great again. Here is a great interview by Entertainment Tonight:Trump told TIME magazine,  I don t have a racist bone in my body. The fact that I want a strong border and the fact that I don t want illegal immigrants pouring into this country, that doesn t make me a racist, it means I love this country and I want to save this country.

" An 11-Year Old Girl Interviewed Hillary, And Her Answers Are Beautiful","Eleven-year-old Marley Dias always wanted to be our first woman president so she could work to fix problems in the world. Then she realized that she doesn t have to be president to start working on the world s problems, and she founded a book drive known as #1000BlackGirlBooks. She s been looking for stories about young, black girls for nearly the last year.Marley s now looking at possibly having our first female president before she s even old enough to vote, and she has a few questions for Hillary Clinton.Elle printed the interview in full, and Hillary replied to Marley the exact same way she would reply to anyone else interviewing her. However, she also seemed to try and relate her experiences in a way that will help Marley as she grows up.For instance, Marley asked her about her favorite books, including her favorite black girl book. On that subject, Hillary told her: One of my favorite authors is Maya Angelou, and I love her book I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. It tells the story of how Maya became such a strong, confident, determined person.Some parts are painful and hard to read, but of course that s the case in a lot of great books. And because Maya became a friend of mine in real life, it meant a lot to be able to read her story and understand her journey better. Hillary then quoted part of Angelou s  On The Pulse Of The Morning,  and finished with: Maya led a really difficult life, but she never forgot that each new day presented new opportunities. I m sure she felt afraid sometimes, just like we all do, but she didn t let her fears hold her back. That s a lesson I try to remember each and every day. As a black girl, who appears to already be growing into a strong black woman herself, knowing that Hillary has taken the experiences of someone like Maya Angelou and used them as inspiration to keep pushing forward, day after day, must be huge.We re not post-gender, and we re not post-racial either. Marley is growing up in a society that still currently sees her as very much less-than. Hillary is saying,  I was scared. You ll be scared. Things will get tough. But you can survive it and come out the other side stronger than you ever thought you could be. Here s how I know. Along those same lines, Marley also asked Hillary what advice she d give to her 11-year old self. Hillary said: I would say that when you have a big dream or you re trying to solve a big problem, there will always be people who tell you that you can t. Here s my advice: don t listen. Keep striving for your goals, and remember that it s good to be ambitious. There s nothing wrong with knowing what you want and going after it.And Marley, what you ve accomplished already is proof of that. Marley started #1000BlackGirlBooks because she was getting fed up with the books that her schools were having her read   they re classics, sure, but they almost always feature white boys as the main character. Black people particularly black girls are never a main character in these books. Yet, the books do exist and she was determined to bring them out into the light.Her book drive has already collected well over 4,000 titles a very impressive feat according to Hillary.Featured image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",0.0
Republican establishment warms to Trump after big New York win,"HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. Republican officials began meeting on Wednesday, a day after Donald Trumps crushing victory in a New York presidential nominating contest, and said he has been winning growing acceptance within their ranks - but they want to see the billionaire do more to mend fences with the party establishment. Trump, the front-runner to become the Republican presidential candidate in Novembers election, was the focus for the partys spring meeting of 168 Republican National Committee (RNC) members in Hollywood, Florida. The three-day conclave at an oceanside resort will take stock of the race for the White House and prepare for a possible contested convention in July in Cleveland. The New York real estate moguls win Tuesday in his home state over rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich was an important milestone for RNC members, who said it could put him on a pathway to acquire the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination outright without a contested convention.  There are a fair number of RNC members who were discounting his chances of success when we met in January and now see that hes building a substantial lead and may in fact get to 1,237 before we get to the convention, said Steve Duprey, an RNC member from New Hampshire. The New York results were such an overwhelming win, Duprey said. Its impressive. Thats what Ive heard people talking about. RNC members said Trump could help improve the climate by taking steps to end the bad blood that has developed between him and the committees leadership, including RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. Trump has said that Cruzs harvest of delegates in Colorado, where rank-and-file Republicans did not vote or caucus, showed that the partys nominating process is rigged. He has wondered whether Priebus, who is popular with the RNC ranks, should continue in his job if Trump is the nominee. I think its time for that rhetoric to end, said Jeff Essmann, chairman of the Montana Republican Party. Bob Kapel, the RNC member representing Washington, D.C., noted that Trump had toned down his rhetoric in his New York victory speech on Tuesday night, and said he would like to see that continue. Kapel is a delegate for former candidate Marco Rubio and now backs Ohio Governor John Kasich. Nevertheless, Kapel said of Trump and the Republicans: Were about winning the White House. Obviously, I have issues with him, but our nominee will be our nominee. South Carolina Republican Party Chairman Matt Moore said Trumps recent hiring of Rick Wiley, a Republican veteran who was former presidential candidate Scott Walkers campaign manager, was a good sign. Its a positive signal despite a lack of general outreach over the past year, and I think the Trump campaign, for all the bluster, recognizes that the RNC will be an integral partner if he is the nominee and itll be almost impossible to win the presidency without the RNC as a partner, Moore said. In a good sign for Trump, there appeared to be no significant move by the Republican leadership, at least at this meeting, to change the rules governing the convention. There has been talk of rewriting the rules in a way that could benefit an establishment-backed candidate like Kasich. Trump, Cruz and Kasich all sent envoys to the meeting to explain their pathways to the nomination. A source familiar with the situation said Wiley and other Trump representatives were meeting with Republican officials from the five Northeastern states that will hold primary elections next Tuesday: Pennsylvania, Delaware, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Maryland. Cruzs campaign manager, Jeff Roe, held a closed-door briefing with RNC members to explain how Cruz would be a better Republican nominee than Trump, saying the U.S. senator from Texas would energize the partys grassroots supporters. Roe dismissed talk that Cruz might now be in trouble. Cruzs pathway to the nomination is now almost entirely dependent on forcing a contested convention and winning the nomination on the second or third ballot. Theres going to be ebbs and flows to this campaign, Roe told reporters. This campaign is going through (the last primary elections on June 7 and likely to the convention. ",1.0
 Trump Gets ROASTED By The White House For Embarrassing Teleprompter Moment (VIDEO),"Up until recently, we ve all been witnessing Donald Trump speak freely with nothing really prepared except for the usual crumpled sheet of paper he d pull out of his coat pocket to read the latest poll numbers to tell us how wonderful he is. However, with clinching the Republican nomination getting closer and closer, he s trying (and failing) to be more refined. Which includes using a teleprompter to read speeches that are prepared for him.During his foreign policy speech on Wednesday, it was painfully awkward to watch. You could hear him reading the speech, which did not come across naturally whatsoever. Watching his head swiftly move from side to side to give the illusion that he was speaking freely was more clumsy than a first date in the dark.Then came the moment when he was trying to be serious and speak about some foreign policy blunders, and he spoke about when some of our embassies overseas were compromised. However, his reading off the teleprompter proved this is probably the first time he has ever heard of the places of which he was speaking.For example, he read: Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. But SAID: Our embassies in Kenya and Tan-ZANE-ia. Small blunder? Sure, but one that was surely noticed by all and just another example of Trump s clear ineptitude.Donald Trump has a pretty interesting way of pronouncing Tanzania. #tanzaynia https://t.co/2ygcnhCVKF  DOPEITSTOM (@DOPEITSTOM) April 27, 2016Taking notice of this blunder was none other than, well, pretty much everyone- but also White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. When questioned about the moment, Earnest quipped: Apparently phonetics are not included on the teleprompter. Watch here:""Apparently, the phonetics are not included on the teleprompter."" @PressSec on Donald Trump foreign policy address.https://t.co/ORuNELmrne  CSPAN (@cspan) April 27, 2016All in all, it shows how ill-prepared Trump is at not only addressing the nation, but also reading.

Kremlin 'has nothing to do' with Russian lawyer who contacted Trump's team,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin has never been in touch with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya who met a group of U.S. President Donald Trumps associates last year, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday. We have already said we are absolutely unaware of this story, we have never been in contact with this lawyer ... She has nothing to do whatsoever with us, Peskov told a conference call with reporters.  Trumps eldest son eagerly agreed last year to meet a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic White House rival Hillary Clinton as part of Moscows official support for his father, according to emails released on Tuesday.

U.S. justices weigh federal fraud claim over woman's death,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday struggled with the question of when federal contractors can be sued for defrauding the government in a case involving a 19-year-old Massachusetts woman who suffered a fatal 2009 seizure at a mental health facility. The parents of Yarushka Rivera claimed that UniversalHealthServicesInc, which owned the facility, provided gravely inadequate treatment and used unsupervised and unqualified personnel. Their lawsuit said King of Prussia, Pennsylvania-based Universal Health Services, one of the nations largest hospital operators, defrauded the government because it was receiving federal Medicaid funding to provide treatment to low-income people and failed to comply with all necessary requirements. Rivera died in October 2009 of a seizure after being treated at the mental health center in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Julio Escobar and his wife, Carmen Correa, filed suit against UniversalHealthServices in U.S. District Court in Boston in 2011. They said they had received information that more than 20 treatment providers at the Lawrence facility, including a nurse who prescribed medication to Rivera, were not properly licensed or supervised as required by state law and federal regulations.  The parents sued under the False Claims Act, which allows individuals to make claims that the federal government has been defrauded.  During the one-hour oral argument, liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan signaled support for the parents fraud claims. Sotomayor said billing for services that were not carried out in full was like a government contractor providing the military guns that dont shoot. Kagan similarly questioned whether the claim against Universal Health Services was any different than a failure by a federal contractor to provide the military boots that can be worn and food that can be eaten. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts appeared more hostile to the fraud claim, saying companies should not necessarily be liable for fraud just because they do not follow every procedure. That causes concern, of course, because there are thousands of pages of regulations under Medicaid or Medicare programs,  Roberts said. Medicare provides healthcare assistance to the elderly. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in 2014. The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated it in March 2015. Universal Health Services then appealed, asking the Supreme Court to resolve what kind of lawsuits can be brought under the False Claims Act. Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, filed briefs backing the company, saying fraud claims should be allowed only when they involve specific violations of the terms of a contract with the government and not violations of other regulations.

 ROFL: An Adult Film Company Just Offered To Make Ted Cruzs Bizarre Dreams Come True (Letter),"A video that recently surfaced of a young Ted Cruz has raised some eyebrows. The creepy little Cruz, aside from declaring his aspirations to be rich, powerful and to take over the world, also expressed an interest in making a  teen tit film,  because he s the perfect Christian. Yes, your sarcasm alarm went off for a reason.Well now Ted Cruz has been given the opportunity to make his dream come true, thanks to adult film giant, Vivid Entertainment. Big shot at Vivid, Steve Hirsch, has extended an offer for Cruz to star in his very own XXX movie that would most certainly be quite a tad more risqu than an 80 s  tit film.  Hirsh offered to send $1 million to the super PAC of Cruz s choice in exchange for his services.This letter to Senator Cruz, obtained by TMZ, lays out the offer, along with a suggested headline for the film, which is nothing short of brilliant and hilarious:Courtesy of TMZThe crack about his home country was a great touch. This is what is called trolling the turd. Mockery at its finest. Ted Cruz, fast becoming the most hated man in Washington, deserves every bit of ridicule he gets.

Netanyahu's no to Obama no big deal but poorly signaled: White House,"WASHINGTON/TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel would have shown good manners had it informed the United States directly rather than through the news media that it was turning down a proposed summit meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama, the White House said on Tuesday. But spokesman Josh Earnest said there was no offense taken by the decision which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday ascribed to a desire to steer clear of the U.S. presidential election campaign. It was the latest episode in a fraught relationship between the right-wing Israeli leader and the Democratic U.S. president that has yet to recover from deep differences over last years U.S.-led international nuclear deal with Israels foe Iran. In a stark reminder of the paralysis in peace talks which Obama tried to revive earlier in his tenure, an American tourist was stabbed to death on a boardwalk in Tel Aviv in the most serious of several Palestinian attacks on Tuesday. The stabbing occurred about the time U.S. Vice President Joe Biden began a two-day visit to Israel. Biden met former Israeli president Shimon Peres and was due to hold talks on Wednesday with Netanyahu in Jerusalem and with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the occupied West Bank. With a wave of Palestinian street attacks now five months old, U.S. officials did not expect a peace breakthrough during Bidens visit. A 2010 Biden visit was marred by acrimony over a Jewish settlement plan Israel announced during his trip.  The White House said on Monday it had been surprised to learn first from Israeli media that Netanyahu had decided against coming to a conference of the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC in Washington on March 20, and to see a suggestion in some reports that Obamas unavailability had been one of the reasons. It said Netanyahu had been offered a March 18 meeting with Obama, ahead of the presidents landmark visit to Cuba on March 21 and 22. Asked whether the Netanyahu government should have told the Obama administration before the media, Earnest said on Tuesday, I think its just good manners.  Zeev Elkin, an Israeli cabinet minister close to Netanyahu, countered that Israeli ambassador Ron Dermer had given the White House advance warning the trip might not happen. Netanyahus office cited the U.S. election campaign in saying he would not travel to Washington for the AIPAC event, and voiced appreciation for Obamas willingness to host him. In 2012, Netanyahu hosted Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney in Israel in what many Democrats saw as a bid to undermine Obamas attempt to secure a second term. Israel denied meddling. While candidates for the Republican and Democratic presidential nomination have been vying to assert their credentials as friends of Israel, Obama is not up for re-election in November, having served a maximum two terms.  Earnest said Biden was not in Israel to handle talks over a memorandum of understanding about the United States providing military support to Israel. There was a separate channel through which those negotiations were taking place, he said. ",1.0
 Conservatives Freak Out After Seeing Obama In Front Of Che Guevara Mural (TWEETS),"President Barack Obama singlehandedly caused a collective right-wing freak out on Monday when he took a picture in front of a Cuban ministry building that just happened to have a Che Guevara mural.Obama has been in Cuba since Sunday, making the trip a truly historic three day visit because a sitting U.S. president hasn t visited the country in 88 years. During the trip, Obama is accompanied by his family and dozens of American politicians and business leaders who are aiding the President in a crucial initiative to build a bridge between the U.S. and Cuba   two countries that have had political differences for decades. This photograph (along with many others) was taken as Obama was taking part in a wreath laying ceremony with several other officials in Havana s Revolution Plaza.Obamas s cause was noble, but as soon as word got out about the photograph, conservative websites didn t hesitate to start bashing the President for posing in front of the image of the Cuban Marxist revolutionary leader. The Drudge Report was one of the first, throwing up the photo on their site and captioning it with  Mission Accomplished. Drudge ReportTownhall.com called the photo a  gem of a picture,  and The Washington Examiner said the image had created a  fresh wave of fury.  The outrage continued on social media, as conservatives on Twitter unleashed an avalanche of accusations and insults. One user called Obama  a disgrace  while another criticized the President for posing with Che Guevara s image but not going to Navy SEAL Chris Kyle s memorial service in 2013.TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterConservatives have been slamming Obama ever since he stepped foot in Cuba yesterday, obviously because they are more in favor of hostile, divisive relations than the mutual understanding and respect that the President is trying to create. Both Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz and former (failed) GOP candidate Marco Rubio have openly condemned Obama s visit. The Right s reaction to Obama s photograph and overall visit to Cuba is just more proof that they will oppose, and try to tear down Obama any chance they get   no matter how far-reaching their reactions are.

STUDY REVEALS MASSIVE SPENDING: Shocking Welfare Use By Immigrants Cannot Go On!,"THE CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES IS AMAZING AT GETTING TO THE FACTS IN THE IMMIGRATION BATTLE: They bring to the table a huge set of figures that should shock every American into action on the state AND federal level. The bottom line is that YOU are paying way too much for legal AND illegal immigrants to come to America and live off of your tax dollars! We cannot and should not go on like this! Please read up and share!A new study on the use of welfare benefits by illegal and legal immigrants in the U.S. finds that households headed by immigrants use an average of $6,200 in benefits annually, fully 41 percent higher than the rate used by native born welfare recipients:This study comes on the heels of another study finding that 51 percent of immigrant households are signed up for at least one welfare program.  Immigrants are such heavy users of welfare not because they don t work, but because, on average, they have little education and thus earn low wages,  said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS).  If we continue to permit large numbers of less-educated people to move here from abroad, we have to accept that there will be huge and ongoing costs to taxpayers.  The study, based on the Census Bureau s 2012 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), notes that the higher use of welfare benefits because by and large the current wave of immigrants are less educated and have fewer needed job skills and are therefore more apt to apply for welfare benefits.The study found the average immigrant household receives 33 percent more cash welfare, 57 percent more food assistance, and 44 percent more Medicaid dollars than the average native-born applicants. Additionally, the highest amount of welfare is taken by immigrants from Central America and Mexico at $8,251 per household, a rate 86 percent higher than native citizens.  The greater consumption of welfare dollars by immigrants can be explained in large part by their lower level of education and larger number of children compared to natives,  CIS said in a press release.  Over 24 percent of immigrant households are headed by a high school dropout, compared to just 8 percent of native households. In addition, 13 percent of immigrant households have three or more children, vs. just 6 percent of native households.   While it is important for Americans to understand the rate of welfare use among immigrants, expressing that use in dollar terms offers a more tangible metric that is tied to current debates over fiscal policy. With the nation facing a long-term budgetary deficit, this study helps illuminate immigration s impact on the problem,  said the report s author, Jason Richwine. Richwine also noted that even as illegal immigrants are supposed to be barred from receiving welfare they receive it anyway by applying for benefits for their American-born children, often called  anchor babies.

 Exxon Mobil Brazenly Attempts To Use Administration To Grant Russian Favors,"During Watergate, the line became  follow the money.  In the Trump, Russia scandal, you can bet that investigators are following the money. In fact, the for-profit scheme is so brazen that the Trump administration, which is packed with oligarchs, is flaunting it.Not only is the Trump administration blatantly profiting off of the office of the presidency, but Exxon Mobil, the company that used to have Trump Secretary of State Rex Tillerson at its helm, is asking for a waiver so they can profit in Russia.This is beginning to sound a bit like deja vu; a Trump meets with a foreign leader and mysteriously, new business ventures open for Trumpsters.Of course, it s one thing is that country is actually a trading partner   then only the Emoluments Clause is brought into question   but when members of the Trump administration attempt to do business with Russia, a country with whom our relationship can best be defined as  it s complicated,  (we have sanctions againt them) more than a few eyebrows are raised. They aren t even pretending anymore. Exxon wants to drill in Russia and you can be sure that if it were just up to the Trump administration, they would be granted their application, despite the fact that they were denied just two years ago.Exxon has been seeking U.S. permission to drill with Rosneft in several areas banned by sanctions and renewed a push for approval in March, shortly after its most recent chief executive, Rex Tillerson, became secretary of state on Feb. 1, according to one of these people. The company originally applied for a waiver to gain access to the Black Sea in July 2015 but its application wasn t approved, the person said.Source: Wall Street JournalWhile Tillerson has recused himself for two years on anything regarding his old company, the people who work for him in the State Department will be processing the application.The only thing standing in the way of the application is our very corporate friendly Republican Congress, although, at a time when they are investigating Russian ties, granting permission might not be the best way to win over voters. They are investigating connections between Trump s administration and Russia. It certainly doesn t look good that right after Trump snatches Tillerson from Exxon Mobil, they ask for favors from the government. Did I mention that Tillerson has what the Wall Street Journal describes as a  close working relationship  with Russia s President Vladimir Putin?The best response to the request did come from one Republican, though. Senator John McCain (R-Arizona) tweeted  Are they crazy?

Congressman wants Homeland Security to address SAT cheating overseas,"(Reuters) - A U.S. congressman called on the Department of Homeland Security to address whether foreign students are cheating on the SAT to get into American universities and illegally qualify for U.S. visas.  In a letter dated Wednesday and sent to the Homeland Security department, Representative Matt Salmon cited a March report by Reuters that detailed the widespread practice of strategic cheating on the SAT by test preparation centers in Asia and what he termed the passive approach of the tests owner  the College Board  to stop cheating overseas.  Salmon, a Republican from Arizona and a member of a House committee on education, wrote in the letter that certain foreign students could fraudulently gain the upper-hand in college admissions by high test scores due to being prepared by these dishonest test-prep centers, thus limiting the options of those students who took the test honestly. Thousands of U.S. colleges use the standardized test to help select applicants. I am concerned that under-qualified students are being admitted to U.S. schools under false pretenses, Salmon wrote.  About 761,000 degree-seeking foreign students currently study in the United States, according to the Institute of International Education. With such a generous foreign student system, Salmon wrote, it is important that we take every effort to ensure its integrity. Homeland Security requires visas for international students to study in the United States. A prospective student must be admitted to a U.S. school before applying for a student visa, and Salmon asked the department whether it had any estimates on how many students may have entered the U.S. with faulty test scores.  In an interview Thursday, Salmon said that he wants to ensure that were not encouraging a bunch of cheats to come and study in our schools.  The College Board, the New York-based not-for-profit that owns the SAT, did not respond to requests for comment. Gillian Christensen, deputy press secretary for Homeland Security, said the department will respond to Salmons letter. In an email, she said the department is committed to ensuring the integrity of the student visa system, while protecting the freedoms and openness that are the hallmarks of our country.  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will aggressively pursue those who seek to exploit and corrupt Americas legal immigration system for personal gain, Christensen wrote. Reuters reported in March that the College Board has often reused tests overseas after first giving them in America months or years earlier, even after some test questions began circulating online. College Board officials have said they are unable to assess how many test-takers have seen actual exam material before taking the SAT. But Reuters found students who had attended test-preparation centers in China and who said they had seen questions ahead of time from SATs they subsequently took. Reuters identified 14 times since late 2013 when parts of an SAT given internationally had been publicly exposed before the exam was given overseas. A confidential PowerPoint presentation, prepared by College Board officials in June 2013, revealed that parts of nine of 18 exams in the organizations global inventory had been compromised. Even so, College Board officials confirmed that some portions of those tainted tests were later administered overseas. In his letter to Homeland Security, Salmon wrote: I was greatly disturbed by recent news reports regarding The College Boards passive approach to preventing and addressing cheating on the SAT test abroad.

Panic on London's Oxford Street after reports of shooting,"LONDON (Reuters) - Panic erupted among Christmas shopping crowds on London s Oxford Street on Friday evening as armed officers raced to respond to reports of shots being fired in the area, but police said later they had found no evidence of gunfire or casualties. Oxford Street, with its festive window displays and hundreds of overhead lights, was crammed with shoppers taking advantage of the Black Friday sales when the incident happened shortly after dusk. London s Metropolitan Police said in a statement they had found no evidence of gunfire, casualties or any suspects and that the incident, which lasted for just over an hour, had been stood down.  Given the nature of the information received, the Met responded in line with our existing operation as if the incident was terrorism, including the deployment of armed officers,  the police said in a statement. British Transport Police posted CCTV images of two men on Twitter, saying they believed that an altercation had erupted between the two men at the Oxford Circus underground station and said they would like to speak to the men, ""who they believe may have information about the incident and the circumstances around the incident."" bit.ly/2jkkVNT A Reuters witness said panicked shoppers had fled Oxford Street and the Oxford Circus underground station. The witness saw an elderly lady and a man carrying a child knocked over in the rush.  There were people running in all directions. I didn t know which way to run,  the witness said. The transport police said they had received a report of one woman suffering a minor injury in the panic. The capital s transport operator, Transport for London, said the Oxford Circus and Bond Street stations, which were briefly shut due to the incident, had later reopened. ",1.0
Trump says he will get into 'great detail' on tax reform in next two weeks,"MANDAN, N.D. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would get into great detail in the next two weeks on his U.S. tax reform plan, which has been short on specifics, even after months of discussions among administration and congressional leaders. Trump, at a speech in North Dakota, listed his broad principles for tax reform as simplifying the U.S. tax code and providing tax relief to middle-class Americans, ideas he has been talking about since his 2016 presidential campaign. Were going to get into great detail over the next two weeks, but were working on it with Congress now and coming up with very exacting numbers, Trump said. The U.S. stock market rallied earlier this year on hopes of swift tax cuts for businesses under Trump, but analysts have since reduced expectations for major tax changes this year. The Republican party is still divided on significant issues, such as whether or not tax cuts should be offset with spending cuts to avoid expanding the federal budget deficit and how deeply to cut the corporate income tax rate.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who accompanied Trump on the trip, said he expected the administrations tax plan to be considered by congressional committees later this month. We have a plan. The plans being socialized with members, Mnuchin told reporters on Air Force One on the return to Washington. Our expectation is it will be in the (congressional) committees later this month, he said. Mnuchin is one of a six-member Republican team that has been negotiating a tax plan behind closed doors for months, excluding Democrats and producing only a few pages of basic principles. Some members of the team have recently tangled with Trump. Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn is also a member of the Big Six team. According to sources close to the White House and an administration official, Trump has soured on nominating Cohn to lead the Federal Reserve.  That comes, two sources said, since Cohn criticized the presidents response to the violence sparked by a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last month. McConnell, leader of the Republicans in the U.S. Senate, is also a Big Six team member. McConnell was attacked repeatedly last month by Trump on Twitter over Congresss failure to repeal and replace Obamacare.  Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota flew with Trump to her home state for the speech and was called on stage by the president along with Republican officials. Everybodys saying, Whats she doing up here? Trump said. But Ill tell you what: Good woman, and I think well have your support. Trump is trying to persuade Democrats to support his push to cut tax rates and simplify the tax code this year, a plan critical to bolstering Republicans heading into 2018 midterm elections, but which so far has included few details. Heitkamp said in a statement that having Trump visit North Dakota was a good opportunity for the state to explain its priorities. She said she was open to working with Republicans and Democrats on comprehensive, permanent tax reform, but she cautioned that the devil is in the details.  The White House plans to put Trump out on the road on a near-weekly basis this fall to sell his plan, which faces huge obstacles in Congress. Republicans control Congress but have so far been unable to pass Trumps top legislative priorities. ",1.0

"'You're wrong', Tillerson says of reports he will be fired","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said there was no truth in reports that the White House had a plan to fire him and replace him with CIA chief Mike Pompeo. Directly addressing the issue at a news conference at NATO, Tillerson dismissed last weeks reports that have overshadowed his week-long trip to Europe, as allies yearn for stability in U.S. foreign policy. This is a narrative that keeps coming up about every six weeks and I would say you need to get some new sources because your story keeps being wrong, he told reporters when asked whether the White House was pushing him out. While Trump said last week he was not leaving and Tillerson said the reports were laughable, Trump has also said he alone determines U.S. foreign policy, saying in a tweet on Friday: I call the final shots. In a trip that will also take him to Vienna and Paris, Tillerson, a former Exxon Mobil Corp chief executive who has been at odds with Trump over issues such as North Korea, has sought to reassure European governments and U.S. diplomats that he is in control. In Brussels on Tuesday, Tillerson said the U.S. State Department, which still has top positions unmanned, was in a much better position to advance Americas interests around the world than we were 10 months ago.  Under the White House plan reported by Reuters and other media last week, Tillerson would be replaced within weeks by CIA Director Mike Pompeo, a Trump loyalist and foreign policy hard-liner, under a White House plan to carry out the most significant staff shake-up so far of the Trump administration. U.S. Republican Senator Tom Cotton, one of Trumps staunchest defenders in Congress, would be tapped to replace Pompeo at the Central Intelligence Agency, officials said. Tillerson, 65, has spent much of his tenure trying to smooth the rough edges of the America First foreign policy that has alarmed Trumps allies, but the president has publicly undercut the secretary of states diplomatic initiatives. At the EU and NATO this week, Tillerson espoused a more traditional U.S. foreign policy, defending the Iran nuclear deal agreed by world powers in 2015, warning of a more assertive Russia and saying he had become quite close with Germanys foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel.

Obama says journalists partly to blame for tone of presidential race,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Monday laid some of the blame for the tone of the presidential campaign on political journalism that has been pinched by shrinking newsroom budgets and cheapened by a focus on retweets and likes on social media. In a speech to a journalism awards dinner, Obama urged journalists to ask tougher questions of the candidates vying to be president. He voiced dismay over the vulgar rhetoric, violence at rallies and unrealistic campaign pledges that have continually grabbed headlines, in a thinly veiled reference to Republican front-runner Donald Trump. The number one question Im getting as I travel around the world or talk to world leaders right now is, What is happening in America? about our politics, Obama said, describing international alarm over whether the United States will continue to function effectively. Its not because around the world people have not seen crazy politics. It is that they understand America is the place where you cant afford completely crazy politics, he said. When our elected officials and our political campaigns become entirely untethered to reason and facts and analysis, when it doesnt matter whats true and whats not, that makes it all but impossible for us to make good decisions on behalf of future generations, Obama said. He said the media landscape has changed since his first presidential campaign in 2008, when there was a price if you said one thing and then did something completely different. The question is, in the current media environment, is that still true? Does that still hold? he said. He said news organizations have a responsibility to dig deeper despite the faster pace of this smartphone age and steep financial pressures in the news business. Voters would be better served if billions of dollars in free media came with serious accountability, especially when politicians issue unworkable plans or make promises they cant keep, Obama said. The New York Times earlier this month reported that Trump has so far earned almost $1.9 billion worth of media coverage, compared with $313 million for the next closest Republican challenger, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, and $746 million for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.

China jails 44 Taiwanese for fraud in case denounced by Taipei,"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - A Beijing court on Thursday handed down jail sentences of up to 15 years to 85 people deported from Kenya for telecoms fraud, including 44 from self-ruled Taiwan, an island Beijing claims as its own which said vital evidence had been ignored. Over the past two years, countries including Kenya, Spain, Vietnam and Cambodia have deported hundreds of people from Taiwan to China for telecoms fraud, sparking accusations from Taipei that Beijing was effectively kidnapping its citizens. China has defended the deportations, saying the crimes were committed against people in China and that as Taiwan is a part of China. The Beijing court said in a statement that one of the Taiwanese, Chang Kai-min, had been jailed for 15 years for helping scam 185 people out of more than 29 million yuan ($4.4 million). Taiwan s China policy-making Mainland Affairs Council said Taiwan and China had initially agreed to cooperate in investigating the Kenya case, but China had gone back on its word. The outside world could only believe justice had been done if the case had fully considered all the evidence and gone through proper legal procedure, the council added.  In this case, we obtained intelligence on the criminal suspects behind the scenes,  it said.  We again call on the mainland China side to cooperate with our public security organs, investigate the origins and not allow the masterminds behind the scenes to get away with it.  On at least two occasions last year, Kenya deported groups of Taiwanese to China. In one case, a Kenyan magistrate said the Taiwanese should be repatriated to their place of origin, Taiwan, but the Kenyan government sent them to China. Kenya, like most countries, only has diplomatic relations with China. Beijing considers democratic Taiwan a wayward province, ineligible for formal ties with other nations. Chinese authorities have sought to contain an explosion of telecom crime it says has led to huge financial losses, with callers often impersonating officials or authority figures and preying on the elderly, students or the unemployed. The fraud has spread overseas, with Chinese speakers recruited in neighboring Taiwan increasingly setting up operations in East Africa or Southeast Asia. The deportations have come as relations between Beijing and Taipei have deteriorated, with China suspecting Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen of pushing for the island s formal independence. She says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security and democracy. ",1.0
"U.S. watching piracy increase off Somalia, sees ties to famine","DJIBOUTI (Reuters) - The United States is closely watching a recent increase in piracy off the coast of Somalia, a senior U.S. military official said on Sunday as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited an important military base in Djibouti. The rise in piracy attacks has at least partially been driven by famine and drought in the region, the top U.S. military commander overseeing troops in Africa said during Mattis visit as part of a week-long trip to the Middle East and Africa.  The United States uses the base in Djibouti, a tiny country the size of Wales at the southern entrance to the Red Sea, as a launch pad for operations in Yemen and Somalia. The sudden string of attacks by Somali pirates comes after years without a reported incident. Attacks peaked with 237 in 2011 but then declined steeply after ship owners improved security measures and international naval forces stepped up patrols. This month has seen a new rash of attacks, with two ships captured and a third rescued by Indian and Chinese forces after the crew radioed for help and locked themselves in a safe room. The bottom line is there have been a half dozen or so(incidents), Marine General Thomas Waldhauser said at a press conference standing alongside Mattis. Were not ready to say there is a trend there yet but well continue to watch, he said, adding one reason for the increase was famine and droughts in the region since some vessels targeted were carrying food and oil. According to the U.N. World Food Programme more than 20 million people from Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen are at risk of dying from starvation within the next six months.  In South Sudan alone, more than 100,000 people are suffering from famine with a further million on the brink of starvation. Mattis added that while the situation was being watched, he did not expect a U.S. military response to the surge in piracy. A U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said international shipping companies had started to become complacent about their security, which could also help explain the rise in piracy incidents. Djibouti is strategically important as it is on the route to the Suez Canal. The barren nation, sandwiched between Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia, also hosts Japanese and French bases. The U.S. base, which has about 4,000 personnel, is located just miles from a Chinese one, still under construction, which has caused concern to some U.S. officials.  Mattis visit to the base comes as the United States has been increasing pressure on militant groups such as al Shabaab in the region. The White House recently granted the U.S. military broader authority to strike al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab militants in Somalia. Waldhauser told reporters that he had not yet used the new authorities given to him by the White House. Al Shabaab has been able to carry out deadly bombings despite losing most of its territory to African Union peacekeepers supporting the Somali government. On Sunday, a military vehicle hit a roadside bomb in Somalias semi autonomous Puntland region on Sunday, killing at least six soldiers and injuring another eight. The United States recently sent a few dozen troops to Somalia to help train members of the Somali National Army. It is also carrying out strikes in Yemen against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). AQAP boasts one of the worlds most feared bomb makers, Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, and it has been a persistent concern to the U.S. government ever since a 2009 attempt to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day.

 Elizabeth Warren Puts News Anchor In His Place For Defending Racist Trump (VIDEO),"The things that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump says and does seem completely indefensible, but ABC News Anchor David Muir somehow found a reason to protect Trump for one of his most horrific qualities: his blatantly obvious racism. And unfortunately for him, he did it in front of the WRONG person.On Wednesday night, Muir interviewed Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren at the Democratic National Convention to talk about her ongoing feud with the brash Republican nominee. In asking Warren about Trump s latest attack on her in which he (once again) called her  Pocahontas,  Muir basically baited the iconic liberal into calling Trump a racist and then criticized her for telling the truth when she did.When Muir asked Warren if Trump calling her  Pocahontas  was racist, Warren had responded: Donald Trump has proven that he is a thin-skinned racist Muir scolded her and said,  But is that calling him a name, too?  It was the wrong thing to say to Warren, because she fired back with pure logic and gave him the education that he so desperately needed. She said: No, it fits the facts. Come on. Then she provided, off the top of her head, a list of some of Trump s greatest, most racist hits: Look at what he has said about Mexicans. Look what he has said about Muslims. Look what he says over and over. As a matter of fact, you don t have to quote me on this. When he had rulings against him over Trump University he tried to attack the judge on the basis of his Mexican-American heritage. Muir should really be thanking Warren for helping him put a childish nickname and an actual prejudice and human rights offense into perspective. There is no defending Trump for all of the disrespectful things he has said about minorities, and we all need to be better educated in calling his bigot remarks out instead of brushing them off, or worse yet, likening them to smaller offenses.You can watch Warren school Muir in the clip below:Featured image via screen capture",0.0
Special Counsel Mueller filing shows Manafort drafted Ukraine op-ed despite gag order,"WASHINGTON (Reuters on Friday ) - U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller late on Friday unveiled a trove of evidence against President Donald Trumps former campaign manager Paul Manafort to convince a judge that he violated a gag order by ghost-writing an article to bolster his public image. The evidence Mueller revealed in a filing, which is a fraction of what he said earlier on Friday he has collected, is the first clear indication of the depth of his investigation and the nature of what his investigators have found. In the 41-page filing, prosecutors in Muellers office produced emails, drafts with tracked edits and records showing that a computer user named paul manafort created a version of the op-ed and made numerous changes on November 29 between 8:41 p.m. and 9:11 p.m., and last saved at 9:12 p.m.. They also produced records indicating that the op-ed, published on Thursday in the English-language Kyiv Post over Muellers objections, tracked talking points Manafort and his business associate Richard Gates wrote in August 2016. That was after Manafort was forced to resign from Trumps campaign because of political work he had done for pro-Russian figures including former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Mueller also claimed in the filing that Manafort collaborated on the piece with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian to whom Mueller alluded in a filing earlier this week as having ties to Russian intelligence. The filing did not disclose how Muellers team acquired the data, and Jason Maloni, a spokesman for Manafort, declined to comment on it. In the filing, Muellers team argued that U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Amy Berman Jackson should deny a request by Manafort to lift his house arrest, saying the op-ed violated her gag order and demonstrated that he cannot be trusted. Bail is fundamentally about trust, the filing said. Even taken in the light most favorable to Manafort, this conduct shows little respect for this Court and a penchant for skirting (if not breaking) rules. Manaforts attorney Kevin Downing on Thursday denied that his client had violated the gag order, saying an article published in a Ukrainian newspaper would not substantially prejudice the case in the United States. [L1N1O72H6] Downing acknowledged in a filing on Thursday that Manafort had helped edit the piece, but said it was his clients First Amendment right to defend himself. He did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on Muellers second filing. Muellers team responded to Downings First Amendment argument by citing a Supreme Court case that found that free speech does not disable a district court  from taking steps to protect cases that could be harmed by the creation of a carnival atmosphere in high profile cases. A federal grand jury indicted Manafort and his business associate Rick Gates in October as part of Muellers investigation into accusations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Russia has denied any meddling and Trump has dismissed any suggestions of collusion. The charges against Manafort include conspiracy to launder money and failing to register as a foreign agent working on behalf of former pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovychs government, who was ousted in 2014. Manafort and Gates are under house arrest and electronic monitoring, but they have been negotiating to have those conditions lifted. All parties were ordered by the judge on Nov. 8 not to discuss the case in public or with the media in a way that could substantially prejudice a fair trial. Earlier this week, Muellers team discovered the draft op-ed was in the works and ordered Manaforts lawyers to shut it down. It was published on Thursday under the byline of Oleg Voloshyn, a former spokesman for Ukraines foreign affairs ministry. [L1N1O71RK] On December 5, Voloshyn emailed the U.S. Embassy claiming credit for writing the piece and accusing Mueller of deliberately twist(ing) the reality, according to an email in the filing. The article praised Manaforts work helping Ukraine secure better relations with the European Union and said he lobbied for pro-Western values, not Russian interests. Documents Mueller filed with the court showed that Gates and Manafort worked together in August and September of 2016 to craft narratives to deflect negative press about Manafort after his resignation from the campaign. Need to beat back the idea that this was nefarious work, a document said. Your efforts were in support and promotion of pro-democratic values around the world. The narratives also claimed that Manafort never worked in Russia or for Russians, that his work was centered on pro-Ukraine efforts to enter the EU, and that he never took cash payments. Manafort and Gates are scheduled to appear in court on Monday for a status conference hearing, where the judge is likely to address the dispute. Earlier on Friday, Mueller revealed in another filing that his office has turned over more than 400,000 emails, financial records and other documents to Manaforts lawyers to demonstrate what evidence the government has against him ahead of a 2018 trial. In addition, they provided imaged copies of 36 electronic devices such as laptops, telephones and thumb drives, copies of 15 search or seizure warrants, and 2,000 so-called hot documents, or those that contain potentially crucial evidence.

SEC Chair White defies Republican requests to stall rulemaking,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White on Monday defied requests by Senate Republicans to delay adopting new rules on everything from derivatives to mutual funds until after President-elect Donald Trump takes office. In a letter to the Senate Banking Committees top two Republicans, Chairman Richard Shelby and Mike Crapo of Idaho, White stressed it was incumbent on the SEC to exhibit a spirit of firm independence in performing its regulatory duties without fear or favor.  Whites Dec. 12 letter, which was reviewed by Reuters, comes in response to a request last month by Shelby and Crapo for the SEC to cease adopting rules until after Trump had a chance to review the agencys agenda.  Republicans in Congress have been pressing agencies across the federal government to wind down their rulemaking activities.    Trump has vowed to kill many regulations put on the books during the Obama administration, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.  White, an independent, is slated to step down from her post at the end of Democratic President Barack Obamas term in January.  The Senate failed to confirm Obamas two nominees for vacant commissioner slots at the SEC before it recessed last week, which means that after White departs next month, the SEC will only be left with two commissioners - one Democrat and one Republican.  Even before she leaves, she could still fail to get the rules passed if she cannot get a quorum of commissioners to agree. Trump has yet to announce a nominee for SEC chair, but many of the people working on his financial regulatory transition team, such as former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, have been highly critical of many of the SECs rules and Dodd-Frank more broadly. In Whites letter on Monday, she provided Shelby and Crapo with a list of all the rules currently ready for a vote.  Among the rules on the list are derivatives reforms mandated by Dodd-Frank, such as capital and margin requirements for swap dealers, as well as a more controversial one that would limit how mutual funds and exchange-traded funds use derivatives to leverage returns. The letter did not say when the SEC might vote on the rules. The agency could do it during an open meeting or behind closed doors. An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment on the timing. I am not insensitive to the issues raised by your letter and have carefully considered what impact, if any, the election should have on the current work of the Commission, White wrote. She added that she had confirmed that the SEC historically has proceeded with its work during comparable post-election periods.     In support of her position, White included footnotes in her letter citing prior statements by Republican SEC Commissioner Mike Piwowar, who is poised to become acting chair in January, in which he voiced support for completing new derivatives rules. This is not the first time the SEC has faced criticism on efforts to complete rules before a change in leadership at the regulator. In 2005, a federal appeals court sided with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in a dispute with the SEC over controversial rules requiring the majority of mutual fund board directors to be independent. The court sent the rule back to the SEC with a directive to consider its costs.  Then-SEC Chairman William Donaldson promptly scheduled a meeting and the SEC re-adopted it a day before his resignation, saying the rule would not be overly costly. The rule was subsequently overturned a second time, and the court chided the SEC for failing to follow proper rulemaking procedures. Even if White is successful in adopting final rules in the coming weeks, Congress may have a way to undo them when Trump takes office on Jan. 20. By law, Congress can vote to reverse regulations within 60 legislative days of them becoming final - which could be easier to accomplish under a Republican-controlled Congress and White House.  ",1.0
Putin Tells Obama and Western Media: Either stop talking about it or finally show some kind of proof,"21st Century Wire says It appears that Putin has had enough with being accused of tampering with the US election process this year. The Russian President s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, pointed out that it was  indecent  of the US to accuse Russia of tampering with its election.   Remember: On Thursday evening CNN reported that Barack Obama vowed to retaliate against Russia for the  hack  that has not been verified by any independent sources nor has it provided a shred of evidence to support the claim   Tyler Durden Zero HedgePutin has had enough of the relentless barrage of US accusations that he, personally,  hacked the US presidential election. The Russian president s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that the US must either stop accusing Russia of meddling in its elections or prove it. Peskov said it was  indecent  of the United States to  groundlessly  accuse Russia of intervention in its elections. You need to either stop talking about it, or finally show some kind of proof. Otherwise it just looks very indecent , Peskov told Reporters in Tokyo where Putin is meeting with Japan PM Abe, responding to the latest accusations that Russia was responsible for hacker attacks.Peskov also warned that Obama s threat to  retaliate  to the alleged Russian hack is  against both American and international law , hinting at open-ended escalation should Obama take the podium today at 2:15pm to officially launch cyberwar against Russia.Previously, on Thursday, Peskov told the AP the report was  laughable nonsense , while Russian foreign ministry spox Maria Zakharova accused  Western media  of being a  shill  and a  mouthpiece of various power groups , and added that  it s not the general public who s being manipulated,  Zakharova said.  the general public nowadays can distinguish the truth. It s the mass media that is manipulating themselves. Meanwhile, on Friday Sergei Lavrov, Russia s foreign minister told state television network, Russia 24, he was  dumbstruck  by the NBC report which alleges that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved in an election hack.The report cited U.S. intelligence officials that now believe with a  high level of confidence  that Putin became personally involved in a secret campaign to influence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.  I think this is just silly, and the futility of the attempt to convince somebody of this is absolutely obvious,  Lavrov added, according to the news outlet.As a reminder, last night Obama vowed retaliatory action against Russia for its meddling in the US presidential election last month.   I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections that we need to take action and we will at a time and place of our own choosing,  Obama told National Public Radio.US intelligence agencies in October pinned blame on Russia for election-related hacking. At the time, the White House vowed a  proportional response  to the cyberactivity, though declined to preview what that response might entail. Meanwhile, both President-elect Donald Trump, the FBI,and the ODNI have dismissed the CIA s intelligence community s assessment, for the the same reason Putin finally lashed out at Obama: there is no proof.That, however, has never stopped the US from escalating a geopolitical conflict to the point of war, or beyond, so pay close attention to what Obama says this afternoon.According to an NBC report, a team of analysts at Eurasia Group said in a note on Friday that they believe the outgoing administration is likely to take action which could result in a significant barrier for Trump s team once he takes office in January. It is unlikely that U.S. intelligence reports will change Trump s intention to initiate a rapprochement with Moscow, but the congressional response following its own investigations could obstruct the new administration s effort,  Eurasia Group analysts added.Continue the story at Zero HedgeREAD MORE MSM LIES AT: 21st Century Wire MSM Watch Files",0.0
"In Myanmar's Rakhine, aid workers blocked from entering Muslim camp amid tension","YANGON/SITTWE (Reuters) - Buddhists in Myanmar on Wednesday blocked aid workers from visiting a camp for displaced Muslims in the central part of Rakhine State, where the United Nations fears the spread of violence that has already displaced hundreds of thousands. More than 600,000 of Myanmar s largely stateless Rohingya minority have crossed to Bangladesh since Aug. 25 attacks by Rohingya militants sparked a military crackdown beset by allegations of killings, rape and arson by security forces. The U.N. has called the army operation  ethnic cleansing . Myanmar has denied the majority of allegations and said it will accept the return of those who can prove they are residents.  A regional administrator and an activist told Reuters a group of about 10 Myanmar nationals working for U.S.- and Britain- based charity Relief International (R.I.) was forced to turn back when residents of the mostly Buddhist ethnic Rakhine community staged a protest in the town of Myebon. Reuters reported this month that activists among the town s Buddhist majority had stepped up efforts to segregate Buddhists and Muslims, instructing Rakhines not to trade with Muslims, for fear of militancy. Deliveries of food aid to Myebon s Muslims have been delayed and only allowed in after inspections by Buddhist community representatives.  The R.I. group were trying to go to the camp and the locals blocked the way,  said Tin Shwe, the town s administrator, adding that the aid workers returned to their office after Wednesday s incident. Samir Maleh, country director for Relief International in Myanmar, declined to comment on the incident. Leaders of the Rakhine Buddhist community have long bristled at international agencies and NGOs whom they accuse of favoring the Rohingya with their support. Aid workers and U.N. staff have told Reuters they fear enforced segregation may trigger further displacement in Rakhine, either through fresh violence or as Muslims flee on boats to Malaysia and Thailand, fuelling a new stage of crisis in the Bay of Bengal. Wednesday s incident was the latest example of the numerous obstacles that humanitarian organizations face in Rakhine State, said Pierre Peron, a spokesman for the United Nations  Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).    Of course we respect that any group should be able to exercise their rights of freedom of speech and peaceful assembly, but the simple fact here is that life-saving aid is being blocked from reaching vulnerable people who desperately need it, including children and the elderly.  About 3,000 Muslims - including Rohingya and those accepted as Myanmar citizens - have been confined to a camp for displaced people in Myebon since communal violence swept Rakhine in 2012. Photos posted on social media site Facebook on Wednesday showed about two dozen women sitting down to block a small street, with a smaller group of men standing behind. Khin Thein, a leader of a regional branch of the Arakan Women s Network, said her group joined the protest after authorities told the community the NGO would provide education about gender-based violence, hygiene and sanitation to Muslims.  They have food, they have shelter to live,  she told Reuters.  We can t accept these kinds of excess things for them. We will not allow them to pass through our township. We already protested several times in the past. We have suspicions about them. We don t trust foreigners, international people.  ",1.0
"Gunman, police officer killed in Russian road checkpoint attack: TASS","MOSCOW (Reuters) - A gunman and a police officer were killed on Sunday during an attack on a road checkpoint in Russia s volatile Caucasus region of Ingushetia, TASS news agency reported, citing security services and a medical source.  One bandit was neutralised, another was blocked in a building during a shootout at a police road checkpoint near the village of Yandare,  TASS reported citing a statement from the National Anti-Terrorist Committee (NAK). Three injured road police officers were rushed to hospital, TASS said, citing a medical source. Throughout the 18 years since Vladimir Putin rose to power and crushed a Chechen separatist revolt, Russia has battled an insurgency seeking to carve an Islamic state out of the provinces of Chechnya, Ingushetia and Dagestan.

"Arms supplied by U.S., Saudi ended up with Islamic State, researchers say","BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Arms provided by the United States and Saudi Arabia to Syrian opposition groups frequently ended up in the hands of Islamic State, an arms monitoring group that analyzed weapons found on the battlefield said on Thursday. Conflict Armament Research (CAR) said most Islamic State weapons were looted from the Iraqi and Syrian armies. But some were originally provided by other countries, mainly the United States and Saudi Arabia, to Syrian opposition groups fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.  These findings are a stark reminder of the contradictions inherent in supplying weapons into armed conflicts in which multiple competing and overlapping non-state armed groups operate,  the group said in a 200-page report. CAR documented at least 12 cases of weaponry purchased by the United States that ended up in Islamic State s hands, either captured on the battlefield or acquired through shifting alliances within the Syrian opposition. Most of these items later ended up in Iraq, the monitor said. In one case, it took only two months for Islamic State fighters in Iraq to get their hands on a guided anti-tank missile the United States bought from a European country and supplied to a Syrian opposition group. All of the items were made in EU states, and in most cases the United States broke contractual clauses prohibiting retransfers by giving the weapons to armed groups in Syria.  Evidence collected by CAR indicates that the United States has repeatedly diverted EU-manufactured weapons and ammunition to opposition forces in the Syrian conflict. IS forces rapidly gained custody of significant quantities of this materiel.  CAR said it similarly traced numerous items used by Islamic State back to exports from Bulgaria to Saudi Arabia, and that these were also subject to non-retransfer clauses that should have barred them from being supplied to Syrian warring parties. Around 90 percent of weapons and ammunition used by Islamic State in Syria and Iraq were made in China, Russia, and Eastern European countries, CAR said, with China and Russia alone accounting for over 50 percent.  These findings support widespread assumptions that the group initially captured much of its military materiel from Iraqi and Syrian government forces,  the report said. Russian-made weapons used by Islamic State in Syria outnumbered Chinese ones,  presumably reflecting Russian supplies to the Syrian regime,  CAR said. Russia is allied with Assad and launched air strikes in Syria in September 2015, its biggest Middle East intervention in decades, turning the tide of the conflict in his favor. On Saturday Iraq declared final victory over Islamic State, which seized more than a third of the country s territory in 2014. Last week Russia declared victory over the group in Syria. CAR reported last year that Islamic State had been making its own weapons on a scale and with sophistication matching national military forces, and that it had standardized production across its realm.

MYSTERY SURROUNDS Funding For Take Down Of Historic Confederate MonumentsNew Orleans Mayor Refuses To Tell,"The mayor of New Orleans is being evasive on who funded the removal of 4 statues in the heart of the city. He s also not responding to questions on when the remaining 3 statues will be taken down and what he plans on doing with them.Who is funding the removal? Shouldn t the citizens know? Do the citizens of New orleans not have a say in any of this?Here s the latest:NEW ORLEANS   Just hours after crews working for the city of New Orleans removed the Liberty Place Monument, Mayor Mitch Landrieu was asked repeatedly where the money came from to pay for the removal and who s paying to take down the other three confederate-era monuments of Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis and General P.G.T. Beauregard.The mayor would only say,  We have enough funding to take down all four monuments. City spokesman Tyronne Walker offered this clarification. Due to the widely-known intimidation, threats and reported violence to contractors and employees, safety concerns have been great and donors will remain anonymous. That is the safe and responsible thing to do. Some people  want to know what s next for the city-owned monuments. Crews took the Liberty Place statue to a city warehouse, not far from the Superdome. Kurt Buchert from Save our Circle, a pro-monument group is asking for transparency from the mayor. The mayor is saying they should be in a museum one day,  Buchert said.  That s a very vague statement. They could go sit in a warehouse for 100 years and then be put in a museum when all of us are dead. Political Analyst Clancy DuBos says the mayor should reveal his plans for the statues. I think the burden is on the mayor to bring this to a close,  DuBos said.  He needs to come up with a plan and say he s what s going to happen with these statues. The council should have some input. The public should have some input. One of the other things the mayor isn t revealing at this time is when the rest of the monuments will be removed.He would only say they would be taken down in a similar manner to the Liberty Place statue,  sooner rather than later. Mayor Mitch Landrieu in a statement Monday declared: The removal of these statues sends a clear and unequivocal message to the people of New Orleans and the nation: New Orleans celebrates our diversity, inclusion and tolerance. This is not about politics, blame or retaliation. This is not a na ve quest to solve all our problems at once. This is about showing the whole world that we as a city and as a people are able to acknowledge, understand, reconcile  ..and most importantly choose a better future. Diversity, Inclusion and Tolerance?New Orleans is one of the unique cities in America. Because of its location, its culture and its commerce, it became one of the important players in the making of early America. The site of two great battles of American History. Had New Orleans not fallen in the Civil War, that conflict would have continued on for years. That IS a large part it s it s rich history ",0.0
 WATCH: Donald Trump Is Considering Gutting Medicare And Giving It To Wall Street,"If you re on Medicare or close to qualifying for Medicare and you voted for Donald Trump, you re a special kind of stupid who just got screwed.House Speaker Paul Ryan can t wait for rubber stamp puppet Donald Trump to take over the White House.He and his fellow Republicans have waited for years to throw hard-working Americans off a cliff and now they are about to get what they always wanted.The GOP has hated Medicare since President Lyndon Johnson signed the program into law in 1965. Medicare is a single-payer system that Americans pay into every time they get a paycheck. And when they turn 65 they can enroll and get a large part of their healthcare coverage taken care of by the federal government. Over 55 million Americans currently rely on Medicare. The program is fiscally solvent through 2028 and a simple way to make it infinitely solvent would be to apply the payroll tax to all income over $100,000.But none of those facts matter to Trump and the Republicans in Congress.You see, they want to privatize the program, which is code for giving it to Wall Street. And as we all know, Wall Street isn t exactly the best place to keep our money. If President Bush had privatized Social Security, something Republicans also want to do while Trump is in charge, the recession would have wiped out the funds and millions of senior citizens would have been left in dire straits.But Trump minion Kellyanne Conway told PBS on Tuesday that Trump is willing to consider Ryan s plan to dismantle Medicare. President-elect Trump has made very clear that he wants to make good on the promises that we as a nation have made to the seniors who rely upon Medicare, and certainly the lower income Americans who rely upon Medicaid and other entitlements like Social Security, frankly, for those who receive that,  she claimed.Ryan s plan however would raise the the retirement age of Medicare and turn it into a voucher system that won t be guaranteed like the system that we have now. He will, I m sure, take a look at Speaker Ryan s proposal and other proposals,  Conway continued.  In this case, he will go ahead and look at alternatives as long as it does not interfere with what he has said, his commitment to keep the promises to those currently relying on them. Here s the video via PBS. The Medicare remarks are at the 5:20 mark.Trump is already backing away from just about every campaign promise he has made and Medicare is no different.According to Talking Points Memo,During the campaign Trump had vowed that he was  not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.  Now, his transition website states that he will  modernize  Medicare,  so that it will be ready for the challenges with the coming retirement of the Baby Boom generation   and beyond  and  [m]aximize flexibility for States [sic] in administering Medicaid. In other words, gutting Medicare and handing what s left to Wall Street is on the table, and if Republicans have their way the program will be dead within the next four years.That means every senior citizen who relies on Medicare for their healthcare needs should start preparing for the higher costs, less care, and less government oversight that comes with handing large government programs that work to vultures. And while seniors may get a half-assed version of Medicare, anyone else who hasn t reached retirement will get nothing but a voucher that isn t worth shit.Frankly, if you are a senior citizen or a worker who has paid into Medicare in hopes that it will be there for you when you need it, you re out of luck. And if you voted for Donald Trump and the GOP, you deserve the reaming you are about to receive.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images",0.0

"U.S. Republican questions timing of $1.7 billion Iran payment, hostage release","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A powerful U.S. lawmaker on Wednesday demanded Secretary of State John Kerry provide an explanation of a $1.7 billion claim settlement paid to Iran just as Tehran released American prisoners last month. Republican Ed Royce, chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote that the timing of the settlement and the administrations failure to brief Congress has led some to express concern that the payment represents a de facto ransom for the release of American hostages. Royce asked Kerry to provide by Feb. 17 information including lists of all U.S. officials who participated in negotiations with Iran over the settlement agreement, the prisoner release and the nuclear agreement announced in July. He also asked for legal analyses of the dispute, a timeline of negotiations over the dispute and an explanation of how the interest payment in the settlement was calculated, among other information. On Jan. 17, the State Department said the United States and Iran had settled a longstanding claim at the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, releasing to Tehran $400 million in funds frozen since 1981 plus $1.3 billion in interest. State Department spokesman John Kirby said Kerry would respond to the letter. He did not offer further specifics on when and how. We can confirm receipt of Chairman Royces letter, and as with all Congressional correspondence, well respond as appropriate, Kirby said. U.S. Republican lawmakers, who are strongly critical of Democratic President Barack Obamas Iran policy, have been questioning the payment for weeks. No Republican supported the nuclear agreement when Congress had the opportunity to review it last year. After the settlement was announced, Obama said it was a better alternative than letting more interest accumulate while waiting for a legal judgment. ",1.0

 FL Man Hurls Live Alligator Through Wendys Drive-Thru Window (VIDEO),"Joshua James, a 24-year-old resident of Jupiter, Florida, is facing charges of assault with a deadly weapon, illegal transportation of an alligator, and theft.The charges were filed after James threw a three-and-a-half foot long, living American alligator through a Wendy s drive-thru window.According to investigators at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Division, James and a friend were driving on Southern Blvd. near Loxahatchee, in Palm Beach County, when he noticed the alligator at the side of the road.He pulled his four-door pickup truck to the side of the road and then wrangled the reptile into the backseat.After capturing the animal, James drove to a gas station, where he proceeded to fill up his gas tank, with the live alligator in the backseat.He then headed off to the Wendy s drive-thru, where he ordered a large drink.After the server handed him his beverage, he reached into the back of the truck, grabbed the alligator, and threw it through the drive-up window, into the restaurant.Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation officers were called to the scene to remove the alligator from the restaurant.Conservation officials took this picture.Image credit: screen capture from NBC 5, via youtubeOn February 9, Judge Joseph Marx released James on $6,000 bail.As part of the terms of his release, James is barred from visiting any Wendy s restaurants. He is also barred from coming into contact with any animals, except for his mother s dog.Under Florida law, it is a third-degree felony to kill, attempt to kill, possess or capture an alligator or its eggs without a license. James faces up to five years in prison on that charge alone.Conservation officials managed to capture the gator. It was released into a nearby canal, where it can hopefully live out the rest of its life without further contact with idiotic humans.According to James, throwing the alligator was just a  funny prank. The people working inside the restaurant didn t find it so funny. Thankfully, neither the employees nor the alligator were injured during this stupid stunt, although things could have ended much differently.Here s more on this story from NBC 5, via YouTube.

" WOW: Republican NYT Columnist QUITS GOP, Rips Trump To Pieces In Must-Read Rant","A Republican New York Times writer just jumped ship from the GOP to become a Democrat because of Republican cowardice to unendorse Donald Trump.Josh Barro, who is also the senior editor at Business Insider, penned a column explaining why he switched parties and he did not hold back. The most important thing we have learned this year is that, when the Republican Party was hijacked by a dangerous fascist who threatens to destroy the institutions that make America great and free, most Republicans up and down the organizational chart stood behind him and insisted he ought to be president,  Barro began before focusing on Republicans who support Trump despite how dangerous he is to our country.Specifically, he called out Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and House Speaker Paul Ryan for standing by Trump anyway  for reasons of strategy, careerism, or cowardice. Referring to them as  cowards and scoundrels,  Barro points to these three as the primary reason he has left the party he grew up supporting. They are taking an action that risks the destruction of the American republic to advance their personal interests,  Barro wrote.  I can only conclude from the available evidence that they love their careers more than they love America. And they are why I quit the Republican Party this week. Barro explained that he has been a Republican for a long time because he didn t  think it was ridiculous to be in a party that I disagreed with on a lot of national issues. He had hoped to help bring change to the Republican Party from within, to  improve ideas at the margin in the long run.  But what this election has made clear is that policy is not the most important problem with the Republican Party,  Barro said.Indeed, Republicans are only really interested in power, which is why Republican leaders have thrown in their lot with Trump. They are hoping Trump will be a puppet who will pass all of their agenda, which would basically burn the government to the ground and usher in a completely ideologically pure conservative government.Barro went on to describe the  fundamental vulnerability  of the GOP.Because of the fact-free environment so many of its voters live in, and because of the anti-Democrat hysteria that had been willfully whipped up by so many of its politicians, it was possible for the party to be taken over by a fascist promising revenge.And because there are only two major parties in the United States, and either of the parties  nominees can become president, such a vulnerability in the Republican Party constitutes a vulnerability in our democracy. I can t be a part of an organization that creates that kind of risk,  Barro said.Considering part of the Republican agenda includes voter suppression and stripping civil rights away from women and minorities, Barro is spot on with his observation.He has also concluded that while moderate Republicans may try to wrestle the soul of the party back from the  conspiracy nuts and proto-fascists  that have taken it over, he believe they  will fail  and he refuses to  stick around to watch. Barro is definitely not alone. Many Republicans have been jumping ship because of Donald Trump. And on Election Day, we will find out just exactly how much the Republican Party has been damaged by this exodus. Because if Trump loses by a landslide and down-ticket GOP candidates get their asses handed to them, it will be such a disaster for the party that they will have no choice. They will have to change or go extinct.Featured Image: baystateconservativenews.com",0.0
Obama cuts short prison sentences for 214 convicts,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama cut short the prison terms of 214 convicts on Wednesday, the largest number of commutations a U.S. leader has granted in single day since at least 1900, the White House said. Obama has now granted a total of 562 commutations during his presidency, more than the number by the past nine presidents combined, it said. In Wednesdays batch, 67 convicts were serving life sentences. The convicts were serving time for crimes including possession of crack cocaine and methamphetamine, with intent to distribute. Some were imprisoned on charges of gun possession.  One of the convicts, James Wright of Baltimore, Maryland, was serving a 20 year sentence that began in 2006 for possession of crack with intent to distribute. He will be released in December. Obama has worked to reform the U.S. criminal justice system and reduce the number of people serving long sentences for nonviolent drug offences. It is a rare issue on which Obama gets support from Republican lawmakers. For years crack offenders faced stiffer penalties than powder cocaine offenders, even though the substances are similar at the molecular level. Critics have said the disparity has unfairly harmed minority and poor communities.   In 2014, Obama announced the most ambitious clemency program in 40 years, inviting thousands of drug offenders and other convicts to seek early release. But the program has struggled under a flood of unprocessed cases.  Our work is far from finished, White House counsel Neil Eggleston said about the commutations. Eggleston urged Congress to take action. While we continue to work to act on as many clemency applications as possible, only legislation can bring about lasting change to the federal system, he said. The program automatically expires when Obama leaves office next January and it is uncertain whether the next president would continue with a similar plan. Donald Trump, the Republican candidate in the Nov. 8 election, has championed law and order in his campaign. Democrat Hillary Clinton has called for criminal justice reform.  ",1.0
 The Rolling Stones Are DONE With Trump Using Their Music (VIDEO),"The Rolling Stones are now on a growing list of rock stars who have asked Republicans to stop using their music. This time it was Donald Trump, who has been playing the Stones  music at his rallies.Just one day after Trump unofficially sealed the GOP nomination, the band stated that they had not given permission for the billionaire to use their music and they asked that he  cease all use immediately. Ironically, the song in question is  You Can t Always Get What You Want,  which is about compromise   something the Republicans know little to nothing about and something that goes against everything Donald Trump has been campaigning against. The campaign has also played  Start Me Up. Trump, who will take anyone to court for virtually anything, seems not to care very much about artists  intellectual property rights.Trump, perhaps more than most candidates, uses music to energize his crowds. Here s just one small sample, although not with the song in question:TrumpTube, which is like YouTube for Donald Trump, posted his playlist and the Rolling Stones song is still at the very top, with an unofficial video, of course.Adele and Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler both asked the candidate to stop using their recorded songs to fire up crowds. Neil Young also objected when the real estate mogul used  Rockin  in the Free World  during his campaign kickoff announcement last year. In those cases, the Trump campaign stopped using the songs.Source: CBS NewsTwisted Sister is also twisted up about Trump using their music without permission. Noted liberals R.E.M. were also fed up with being used by Trump.Trump is far from the only Republican to receive backlash from artists for using their music. FiveThirtyEight compiled this list last year, after Neil Young told Trump to knock it off. The list begins with Ronald Reagan, after Bruce Springsteen famously told him that  Born In The USA  didn t mean what Reagan thought it did. Both Bushes received cease and desist orders. John McCain made enemies of a whopping nine artists   as diverse as ABBA, Heart, Jackson Brown, Tom Petty and the Foo Fighters. John Cougar Mellencamp had to ask two GOP candidates, McCain and Reagan, to stop using  Pink Houses.  Again, they had no idea what that song was about.Whether Trump (or any others of the candidates) was really violating copyright law is up to interpretation. Most commercially marketed music is licensed through one of two organizations, ASCAP and BMI. Campaigns can buy licenses without the artists  permission in most cases, however, some of the more powerful and influential artists do have some say over what songs can be included in the licensing agreements.Trump s campaign hasn t yet commented.Featured image via YouTube screen shot.",0.0

Seven arrested in Egypt after raising rainbow flag at concert,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian police arrested seven people on Monday after they were seen raising a rainbow flag at a concert, security sources said, in a rare public show of support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights in the conservative Muslim country. Security sources said the seven were arrested for  promoting sexual deviancy,  a euphemism in Egypt for homosexuality, after they were seen on camera raising the rainbow flag at a Mashrou  Leila concert, a popular Lebanese alternative rock band whose lead singer is openly gay. Egyptian Public Prosecutor Nabil Sadek ordered the State Security Prosecution to immediately investigate the incident, state news agency MENA reported. The public prosecutor has not yet announced a decision on whether formal charges will be filed and a case brought to court. Although homosexuality is not specifically outlawed in Egypt, it is a conservative society and discrimination is rife. Gay men are frequently arrested and typically charged with debauchery, immorality or blasphemy. The largest crackdown on homosexuals in Egypt took place in 2001, when police raided a floating disco called the Queen Boat. Fifty-two men were tried in the case, which drew widespread criticism from human rights groups and Western governments. ",1.0

"Chile left-wing candidates could form alliance, threatening market rally","SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile s stock market has priced in a victory of conservative presidential candidate Sebastian Pinera, even though progressive candidates could form an alliance in a December runoff, traders and analysts said. The IPSA stock market index has surged 27 percent this year and is on track for its best year since 2010, spurred by a rebound in prices of top-export copper and polls that have shown Pinera ahead in the race. Pinera, a wealthy businessman and supporter of free-market policies, is expected to come in first by a wide margin in November s first-round vote, but he is unlikely to win an absolute majority. That would result in a close runoff against the leading progressive candidate.  The majority is left of center,  said Kenneth Bunker, a political scientist at Universidad Central de Chile.  A Pinera victory depends on division within the left.  The most recent GfK Adimark poll shows Pinera, who has consolidated the support of the country s political right, leading at 34 percent of the vote. Center-left Senator Alejandro Guillier is second with 16 percent, well ahead of several candidates promising to continue President Michelle Bachelet s socially progressive policies. Hard-left candidate Beatriz Sanchez, who has proposed billions of dollars in new taxes on mining companies, was third at 15 percent. As campaigning officially began last week, Guillier appealed for unity, saying in a radio interview that he would share his policy platform with rivals on the left to try to align their positions.  No one doubts that in the second round we will all be together,  Guillier said at a rally. While Chile remains one of Latin America s most business-friendly countries, public debt has grown as falling copper prices hit government revenue, and Bachelet critics say she has not prioritized growth. Last month, her top economic officials resigned in part over the government s rejection of a $2.5 billion copper and iron project on environmental grounds. Investors are particularly attentive to candidates  proposals related to mining, Chile s most important industry. Guillier and Pinera have both pledged to streamline the mine permitting process, though Guillier has suggested modifying free-trade accords to promote domestic mineral processing. In a banner year for emerging markets, the IPSA has outpaced most regional peers. Brazil s Bovespa Index has surged 24 percent, Peru s leading index is up 20 percent, and Colombia s COLCAP index is up 9 percent. Only Argentina s Merval, up 49 percent, has surged more.  The industrial and raw materials sectors have led Chile s market gains, surging 55 and 41 percent year to date, respectively. Lithium miner Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile SA has risen 77 percent in the past 9 months, while shipping firm Compania Sud Americana de Vapores SA is up 97 percent. In recent client notes, Credit Suisse and J.P. Morgan have said the so-called  Pinera effect  has passed and that now might be the time for traders to take profits or wait for election results. Hugo Rubio, president of brokerage BTG Pactual Chile, said a Pinera loss would cause a double-digit drop in the stock market, though the full extent would depend on the candidate.   It s a risk the markets don t seem to be alive to at this stage,  said Edward Glossop, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics in London.  The risks are to the downside.  ",1.0
Self-driving car advocates launch ad campaign to prod Congress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A coalition of supporters of self-driving cars said on Tuesday that it will run ads this week in social media and Washington newspapers, in an effort to convince the U.S. Congress to adopt sweeping legislation to boost the nascent industry. The ads are being placed by the Coalition for Future Mobility, which was formed in July by trade groups representing major automakers, along with other advocates for self-driving cars, as Congress began serious consideration of bills relating to autonomous vehicles. They want the Senate to pass a bill that would speed up the use of self-driving cars by easing safety regulations, and bar states from blocking such vehicles. The House of Representatives has already unanimously approved a bill. The Senate is considering a similar draft measure, but is divided over whether to include large commercial trucks, a dispute that could prevent the bill from winning approval this year.  The House measure, which only applies to vehicles under 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg), would allow automakers to obtain exemptions to deploy up to 25,000 vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards in the first year. The cap would rise over three years to 100,000 vehicles annually. As part of the campaign, major automakers will be contacting their employees and retirees, asking them to reach out to their members of Congress, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said. The coalition launched a website and will use targeted Facebook advertising, focusing on groups who could benefit from autonomous vehicles, such as disabled veterans. One of the print ads seen by Reuters features a man dressed in military fatigues sitting in a wheelchair. The ad says: He fought for our freedom. Lets give him back his. That will only become a reality if Congress acts, the ad says. The coalition includes trade groups representing automakers General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), as well as organizations including ride sharing firm Lyft Inc, the Telecommunications Industry Association, the American Council of the Blind and a drone industry group.      Senate aides have been negotiating in recent days but have not reached agreement. A Senate panel could take up the issue at an Oct. 4 hearing, aides say. Auto industry leaders say 3 million commercial truck jobs could eventually be at risk if self-driving vehicles replaced human drivers. Self-driving proponents say 94 percent of U.S. car crashes are the result of human error and argue self-driving cars could dramatically cut the 35,000 annual road deaths. ",1.0
 Democrat Takes Trump To The Woodshed In Fiery Speech Defending NFL (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is getting absolutely hammered for his recent attacks on NFL players who refuse to stand during the National Anthem in a stand against social injustice. Trump has tried his hardest to pass off those attacks as a defense of patriotism, but most Americans know that Trump is simply trying to mask what are obviously remarks fueled by his own racism   and one Democrat is calling him out for it.Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., blasted Trump on the House floor on Monday and attacked the undeserving POTUS for his pathetic attacks on athletes such as Stephen Curry, Lebron James and the NFL players. In his powerful, fiery speech, Jeffries asked the question that most of us would like to know:  How dare Donald lecture us on what s patriotic?!  You can watch this epic speech below:Just defended @StephenCurry30 @KingJames @Kaepernick7 on House floor. How dare donald lecture us on what s patriotic?! pic.twitter.com/wfbtDajTLD  Hakeem Jeffries (@RepJeffries) September 25, 2017And that s not the only time Jeffries has spoken out against Trump about the POTUS  recent attacks on athletes. In an interview with CNN, Jeffries called Trump a  racial arsonist  and stated that Trump was causing controversy just to keep his dwindling conservative fan base happy and engaged. Jeffries said: He uses race to advance his own ends. We couldn t have said it better. It is no coincidence that Trump s fan base are practically just white supremacists   who he has repeatedly failed to denounce because he doesn t want to lost the only support he has left. Trump knows that his fans are losing interest and patience after all of his broken campaign promises, so he creates these  scandals  and spews nonsense to distract everyone and remind his racist fans why they voted for him in the first place. Trump s remarks about the NFL are disgusting and deserve to be condemned again and again.Featured image is a screenshot",0.0
"Congress votes to avert shutdown, sends Trump stopgap spending bill","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress on Thursday averted a government shutdown just one day before federal funding was due to expire, sending President Donald Trump a bill to provide just enough money to keep agencies operating through Jan. 19. With lawmakers eager to begin a holiday recess until Jan. 3, the House of Representatives and Senate scurried to pass the hastily written bill by votes of 231-188 and 66-32, respectively. When Congress returns, lawmakers will immediately have to get back to work on appropriating more money for a fiscal year that already will be three months old. They will try to pass an omnibus spending bill to fund the government from Jan. 19 through Sept. 30. Negotiators have been struggling for months over thorny issues such as the amount of defense-spending increases versus increases for other domestic programs, including medical research, opioid treatment and anti-terrorism activities. Fiscal hawks, meanwhile, are angry that Congress is again moving to bust through spending caps that had been designed to tamp down mounting federal debt. But some of those same lawmakers in the Republican-controlled Congress earlier in the week voted for a sweeping tax bill that will add $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years to a national debt that already stands at $20 trillion. With the clock ticking toward a deadline of midnight on Friday when government funding would run out, Democrats in the House and Senate made a strong pitch for including protections for young immigrants who entered the country illegally as children, popularly known as Dreamers. In the end, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and immigration advocacy groups failed. But nearly all of the Houses 193 Democrats and 29 of the Senates 46 Democrats voted no, in part to protest the lack of action on the immigration measure. Shortly before the House and Senate votes, Democratic Representative Luis Gutierrez told reporters, Were really tired of tomorrow, referring to years of failed attempts in Congress to protect Dreamers from deportation, allow them to legally work in the United States and get on a path to citizenship. They will resume their fight in January, aiming to win on the next spending bill or a separate measure. Trump has eliminated Obama-era temporary protections for Dreamers, but has asked Congress to come up with a permanent solution by March. In the meantime, about 122 Dreamers a day are becoming vulnerable to deportation while Congress bickers. Also on Thursday, the Senate put the brakes on another bill that passed the House, which would provide $81 billion in new disaster aid to help Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and several states hit by this years hurricanes or wildfires. The temporary spending bill did, however, give Trump a modest increase of $4.7 billion for the Department of Defense to be used for missile defense and ship repair. The bill includes $2.85 billion to fund the Childrens Health Insurance Program through March and funding for community health centers and the Indian Health Service. The plan also would extend the National Security Agencys expiring internet surveillance program, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, through Jan. 19. Other provisions address funding for veterans, the Coast Guard and flood insurance. Most government programs would be temporarily extended until Jan. 19 at fiscal 2017 levels. ",1.0

 Trump-Touted Wisconsin Deal Forces Taxpayers To Shell Out $3 Billion,"Donald Trump is so desperate to take credit for job creation that he ignored the fact that the deal he bragged about takes money away from every person in Wisconsin.On Wednesday, Trump made a big deal about a Chinese company known as Foxconn building a factory in Wisconsin that could create up to 3,000 jobs.Thank you Foxconn, for investing $10 BILLION DOLLARS with the potential for up to 13K new jobs in Wisconsin! MadeInTheUSA?? pic.twitter.com/jJghVeb63s  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 27, 2017In addition, Trump claimed that the deal would not have happened had he not been elected, and went on to suck up to Foxconn chairman Terry Gou. His great company has seen our you know, you see exactly what I m saying our administration s work to remove job-killing regulations he s been watching to institute Buy American and Hire American, and all of those policies, and to pursue the steps necessary to revitalize American industry, including repealing and replacing Obamacare we better get that done, fellas, please. It should be pointed out that Foxconn was already planning to build a factory in the United States long before Trump ever considered running for president.But if Trump really wants to take credit, that means he is also taking credit for Republicans screwing over the people of Wisconsin to get the factory to come to their state.You see, in exchange for Foxconn choosing Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers and Governor Scott Walker approved a $3 billion subsidy for the company. According to Bloomberg, that amounts to taking $519 from every man, woman, and child in Wisconsin to fund what the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel points out  would total more than the combined yearly state funding used to operate the University of Wisconsin System and the state s prison system. And let s remember that we are talking about a private company that is already worth billions. Foxconn does not need billions of dollars of government subsidies to expand. They have the money to do it themselves. This amounts to nothing more than Foxconn holding the people of Wisconsin hostage and Republicans letting them and complying with their demands.And that is especially disastrous for Wisconsin since Foxconn is known for promising investments and not delivering.As Bloomberg reported,Three years ago, Gou signed a deal with the government of Jakarta, Indonesia s capital and its biggest city, to invest $1 billion and employ local workers to make electronics. That never happened. Neither did a $30 million high-tech factory in Pennyslvania that was announced a year earlier. Just this past year, Foxconn is reported to have pledged investments of $5 billion in India; $3.65 billion in Kunshan, China; and $8.8 billion in Guangzhou. It s too early to know if those sums will ever be spent, but including Wisconsin, the tally now stands at $27.5 billion of commitments. That s more than Hon Hai [Foxconn s flagship company] has spent in the last 23 years.So while Trump is busy touting the deal to make himself look good, he is doing so at the expense of Wisconsin taxpayers, many of whom now have to worry about how they will get by after paying Foxconn s ransom.Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",0.0

"OUCH! CHUCK TODD HUMILIATES DNC Chair Over Sickening VA Governor TV Ad Democrats Wont Denounce: I Drive A Pickup Truck, Am I Racist? [VIDEO]","It s hard to shame someone when they have no shame If you live in Virginia and you haven t voted for Ed Gillespie (R) for Governor yet, this ad, and the DNC Chair s unapologetic tone for its disgusting content will make you want to run to the polls before they close. Hopefully, this ad will be the push Ed Gillespie needed to get him across the finish line in Virginia.While most condemned the Latino Victory Fund ad that ran during the closing days of Virginia s gubernatorial race, which showed a supporter of Republican candidate Ed Gillespie driving a pick-up truck and running down Hispanic, Muslim, black, and Asians kids, Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez seemed to be fine with it. It also appears that the Democratic candidate, Ralph Northam, coordinated with LVF to push that ad; LVF listed the ad as a $60,000+ in-kind media contribution. There s nothing wrong with that, but Northam said this ad was totally outside his campaign operation. Not true.Speaking with Meet the Press s Chuck Todd, Perez said that there s been a lot of dog whistling in this race and that Northam was trying to unite people. Right so, you do that by apparently coordinating with the LVF to push an ad that says white people are all racists, drive pickup trucks, love the Confederacy, and just cannot wait to run over nonwhites in the street? The Roanoke Times, which isn t a Republican-friendly paper, aptly noted that what this ad conveys is that Republicans are bad people, and if you support them you re a bad person. It portrays white rural voters as genocidal, and while they offer Hillary Clinton some cover they say her remarks were misinterpreted the LVF ad conveys a  deplorable -like tone.   TownhallThe NBC Meet The Press host, Chuck Todd commits a courageous and unexpected act of journalism, when he asks the unapologetic DNC Chair Tom Perez:  Aren t you stereotyping?

" BREAKING: Melania Trumps Immigration Records Made Public, Show Trumps ULTIMATE Hypocrisy","GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has taken a ridiculously hardline   and even bigoted   stance on immigration. He has promised to build a wall and force Mexico to pay for it, and he has said that he will erect  deportation forces  to root out and get rid of all people in the United States without proper documentation. Well, as we already knew, it turns out that The Donald is the ultimate hypocrite on this one.According to the Associated Press, it turns out that Donald Trump s wife Melania violated immigration laws by working illegally in the United States when she first arrived from her native Slovenia. Melania often modeled using just her first name, and was first granted entry into the country on a visitor s visa, known as a B1/B2 visa. This occurred on August 27, 1996. Melania did not get a legal work visa until October 18, 1996. During the time when she was prohibited from working in the country, Melania made money on ten different modeling assignments, totaling upwards of $20,000. She got a green card in 2000, and became a naturalized citizen in 2006.So, in other words, Melania Trump lied about her immigration story, as recently as Thursday, when she once again touted how a million percent legal immigration is the only way to go, and that this is how she did it. Melania said, in part, in her stump speech: As a young entrepreneur, I wanted to follow my dream to a place where freedom and opportunity were in abundance. So of course, I came here. Living and working in America was a true blessing, but I wanted something more. I wanted to be an American. Well, it appears that, as has long been suspected, that Melania Trump wasn t as kosher in her immigration and work practices as she claims. The information obtained by the AP include, but are not limited to, her contract from Metropolitan International Management   a modeling agency. Also, there s the ledgers from the agency, which is no longer in business, that shows Melania working during the time when she had the visitor s visa, but no work visa. It seems to be a complicated story full of many attempts to cover up Melania s wrongdoing, but it is certainly quite interesting. This would be why Melania Trump never released actual records regarding her initial immigration to the United States and her eventual path to citizenship. While it is unlikely that her citizenship is at risk, it certainly means that she committed immigration fraud. You can read more here at the Associated Press.The long and short of it is this: Donald Trump launched his crazy bid for the presidency preying on the fears of the  other.  Namely, immigrants. That is the height of hypocrisy, seeing as how his own wife didn t completely comply with immigration law. Hopefully this story, and the many other lies and cover-ups and shady dealings surrounding the Trump campaign break through the hypnotism that the demagogue has spun onto so many desperate citizens of this great country, and they figure out that they are falling for the biggest con of all time.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",0.0

 Chelsea Clinton Teaches Trump How To Treat The White House With Respect,"Donald Trump insulted the  People s House,  so Chelsea Clinton subtly ripped him a new one for it.During a recent outing to his Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump told members that the White House  is a real dump. The insult outraged Americans across the country. No president should talk about the White House that way. It s disrespectful, especially to the people charged with preserving it and keeping up the maintenance, which is paid for by American taxpayers.Trump is probably mad because the decor doesn t feature gold-plated walls like his penthouse at Trump Tower.But the White House has a history. It was burned by the British during the War of 1812. But we rebuilt it. Years of neglect and failure to update the historic residence resulted in the biggest overhaul during the Truman presidency. The White House was gutted and Truman was forced to take up residence across the street until the renovation was complete.Today, the White House stands as a magnificent mansion that honors the past while continually updating to remain equipped with the latest technology. Sometimes, it s hard to keep up, but the White House staff does the best they can.Trump s remark was off the cuff to people who paid to be around him. He probably thought his comment would be off the record, which means he said exactly what he meant to say.But Chelsea Clinton was not amused by Trump s insult.

This is how a grateful and unspoiled person acts. Trump is used to excess and flaunting his wealth. He has no idea what it means to live in an ordinary household. To him, the White House is a step down, and that is truly insulting. So much so, that he should resign and move out if he hates being there so much.Back in May, Trump bragged to Time Magazine that he s the  certain type of person  who sees the beauty of the White House. People have no idea the beauty of the White House. The real beauty of the White House,  he said.That was clearly a lie Trump told the media to make himself look good.

Republican senator criticizes Trump tax plan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Rand Paul, a conservative maverick who helped kill the latest Republican effort to overturn Obamacare, took issue with President Donald Trumps tax plan on Monday, asking in a tweet if it was really Republican. This is a GOP tax plan? Possibly 30 percent of middle class gets a tax hike? I hope the final details are better than this, the Kentucky Republican said in a statement on Twitter. He cited the results of a recent analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center think tank. Pauls message could signal difficulties for tax reform in the Senate, where Republicans hold only a 52-48 majority over Democrats and have failed this year to overturn the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. Last week, Republican Senator Bob Corker told reporters he would not vote for tax legislation if it raises the deficit. Trump and top Republicans in Congress say the tax plan they released last week will deliver a big tax cut to middle-class families and to businesses, and simplify the law by doing away with myriad deductions, loopholes and tax breaks.  But the Tax Policy Center found that many upper middle-income professionals and business people would see their tax bills go up from the loss of deductions.  Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have also acknowledged that some people could see a tax hike. Republican Kevin Brady, chairman of the tax-writing House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, pushed back on the centers analysis and said Paul was basing his opinion on a report the U.S. representative dismissed as incomplete.        Look, I love Rand Paul. He and I play baseball together as well, and hes a friend, Brady said on Monday. (But) this is not the group you go to ... they have none of the key details that would allow an objective, complete analysis. Brady, a member of the Big Six tax negotiators from Congress and the Trump administration who produced the framework, declined to say whether every American would see a tax cut from the plan. But he added: I will guarantee we are going to work hard to lower taxes on every American, increase their paychecks and dramatically simplify the code for them. ",1.0
British foreign minister arrives in U.S. to meet Trump advisers,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britains foreign minister Boris Johnson has arrived in the United States to meet close advisers to President-elect Donald Trump and senior Congressional leaders to discuss ties between the countries. Last Junes vote to leave the European Union has left Britain facing some of the most complicated negotiations since World War Two, with the country keen to deepen ties with the United States and other nations to show that Brexit will not diminish its standing in the world. Johnsons visit, which was not flagged in advance, is part of Prime Minister Theresa Mays strategy to improve relations with Trumps team after the president-elect irritated the government by saying that outspoken anti-EU campaigner Nigel Farage would be a good choice for Britains ambassador to Washington.  Mays two most senior aides made a secret trip to the United States last month. Following the successful meeting last month between the Prime Ministers chiefs of staff and President-elect Donald Trumps team, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is undertaking a short visit to the U.S. for meetings with close advisers to the president-elect and senior Congressional leaders, a spokesman for Britains foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday. The discussions will be focused on UK-U.S. relations and other foreign policy matters. May had told Sky News earlier in the day that she was sure that Britain and the United States would build on their close ties and that their special relationship would endure despite describing some of his comments about women as unacceptable.

"Icahn praises Trump economic plan, says candidate will get blue-collar vote","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn said on CNBC on Tuesday that Donald Trump is right on about the economy and said the Archie Bunker of the world will vote for the Republican presidential candidate. Archie Bunker, a fictional conservative blue-collar worker from the New York City borough of Queens, was the main character in the 1970s television comedy All in the Family. Icahn praised Trumps economic plan a day after the New York real estate developer unveiled it in a speech in Detroit. Trump proposed sweeping tax breaks, cuts to federal regulations and a revival of the stalled Keystone XL project. Bunker has been described as the shows lovable bigot, but Icahn said there was no bad intention in comparing middle-class voters to the character. Any middle-class worker, you know, the Archie Bunker of the world - that was a great show, I used to watch it - those guys are going to vote for him because those are smart guys, Icahn said.  They know they are getting screwed, and that is what I think will happen, Icahn said in an apparent reference to the decline in U.S. manufacturing, a theme of Trumps. Archie Bunker is a middle-class guy, somewhat educated even, that doesnt know where his next check is coming to send his son or daughter to school, doesnt know if hes going to keep his job. ... Why the hell should he vote for a system that is not giving him a good-paying job? Icahn said. Icahn echoed his remarks on CNBC on Twitter, saying, Trump is right on about our economy. A capitalistic system cannot exist if government is at war with business. CEOs rightly so are afraid to invest in new equipment, etc. to make our manufacturing competitive.  It is no surprise that today it was announced growth in productivity was down for the 3rd straight quarter and is at an all-time low. Our workers cannot be productive with worn out tools.    The Labor Department reported that U.S. nonfarm productivity unexpectedly fell in the second quarter, pointing to sustained weakness in the economy. Trumps speech came after a week of falls in opinion polls and clashes with the family of a fallen U.S. Muslim soldier and fellow Republican leaders. Icahn said he did not defend Trumps remarks about the family of soldier Humayun Khan, calling them a mistake. People make mistakes. Asked by CNBC why Icahn was not named to Trumps group of economic advisers, Icahn said he wanted to focus on a new Super PAC. Last week, Icahns general counsel, Jesse Lynn, told Reuters that Icahn turned down an invitation to join the group because the investor is considering funding a Super PAC focused on regulatory reform. It would be Icahns second Super PAC. ",1.0
 Trump Gets His Safe Space As Womens Protest Is BARRED From Inauguration Site,"Trump cannot handle dissent. He cannot handle people who don t like him and won t kiss his rings and his boots. He cannot handle protests, as he proved during his campaign when he had protesters hauled out of his venues, sometimes forcibly. The Women s March on Washington had been organized for the Lincoln Memorial for the day after the inauguration   Jan. 21   and they ve been denied the permit to do it. The Presidential Inauguration Committee filed what s being called a  massive omnibus blocking permit  for the area for many days before and after the event.It s extremely unusual for the inauguration permit to block other events for several days after the inauguration. Before and during, sure. After, though? Mara Veyrheyden-Lilliard has filed lawsuits to get protesters access to the Lincoln Memorial on Inauguration Day. Since the Women s March was scheduled for the day afterward, she doesn t understand what s going on: It hasn t come up in any way previously, where you ve had a groundswell of people trying to have access on the Saturday, January 21, and thousands of people want to come, and the government is saying we won t give you a permit. It hasn t come up in any way previously, where you ve had a groundswell of people trying to have access on the Saturday, January 21, and thousands of people want to come, and the government is saying we won t give you a permit. She went on to say: We ve issued the demand to the parks service because this is an illegal abridgment of first amendment rights   We expect they ll conform to the constitution and make permits available. It s true that the Presidential Inauguration Committee filed for their permit ten months before the Women s March on Washington filed for theirs, and that there are a limited number of permits to go around so it s  first come, first serve.  Mike Litterst, of the National Park Service, which is the agency that issues these permits, said that the Lincoln Memorial and the rest of the National Mall will be available to the public during all these events   just not for organized events needing a permit. These sites are essentially construction sites, he says, and thus, not suitable for other organized events. The Women s March is expected to have well over 100,000 attendees and so of course it requires a permit from the National Park Service.Come on, though. The inauguration is on the 20th, the Women s March is on the 21st. They seriously can t get a permit for that day? Now the options for public protests along the National Mall are extremely limited, possibly until March 1, which is when deconstruction of the inauguration venue is supposed to be complete.Since the Lincoln Memorial is the site of many historic protests, including the 1995 Million Man March, it makes sense that the Women s March would want to gather there, too. They ve secured another site nearby, but it probably won t have quite the same symbolism as it would at the Lincoln Memorial.Featured image by Steve Pope via Getty Images",0.0

 Armed White Thugs Hunt Down Black Teen Until He Collapses And Dies,"A 16-year-old is dead after a group of white thugs threatened to gun him down and chased him until he collapsed and died from an asthma attack.Dayshen McKenzie and his friend Harry met up with the group behind a restaurant and an argument over a girl escalated into threats of violence and a chase that had McKenzie running for his life.According to Harry,  The guy said,  You got a problem?  And my (friend) said,  You got a problem?  and it went on. They left, and they came back three cars deep. The guy in the first car had a gun. The white thugs literally tried to hunt McKenzie down like a wild animal but he forgot his inhaler that day so when he needed it he didn t have it. But he wouldn t have had an asthma attack in the first place had he not been chased down by a bunch of gun-wielding racists.Former police officer Diane Fatigati came forward as a witness after trying to save McKenzie with the use of CPR. But she was unable to revive the teen. To me, it s murder,  she said.  They were chasing him   that s a crime. You re hunting them because they re black   You re calling them a n****r. To me, it s a hate crime. McKenzie s mother, Tisha Richardson is sad and angry over the senseless killing of her son. I want justice for him. Somebody should be held accountable,  she said.Needless to say, police are investigating McKenzie s death but yet another young black man is dead at the hands of racists in 21st century America.But we can likely expect even more of these killings if Donald Trump becomes president. After all, he encourages violence and intimidation of black people and has even promised to pay the legal bills for supporters who are arrested when they actually do what Trump tells them to do.In addition, Trump has made racist rhetoric more of a norm that is no longer shocking people like it once did in political campaigns of the past.You can bet white supremacists are salivating at the thought of Trump becoming president because they think they ll have a license to intimidate and kill black people whenever they want without consequences. Because right now, the only way they can do that is to get hired by the police.Featured Image: New York Daily News ",0.0
Catalan separatist leader turns down chance to talk to Spanish Senate,"MADRID (Reuters) - Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont has turned down an invitation to address Spain s Senate on Catalonia s bid for independence on Thursday, a spokesman for the regional government said. Earlier on Wednesday, aides had indicated that Puigdemont, who is the region s president, would attend the session in Madrid.  But a spokesman for Puigdemont said later the Catalan leader would not do so because the Spanish government had already announced its intention to impose direct control on the autonomous region to counter its independence drive.

Kentucky's Republican governor calls for probe of Democratic predecessor,"LOUISVILLE (Reuters) - Kentuckys Republican governor on Tuesday called for an investigation into how his Democratic predecessor awarded state contracts and solicited campaign contributions, opening a new round in the feud between the two political families. Governor Matt Bevin said he has asked for the hiring of a law firm to determine whether Steve Beshears administration coerced state employees into donating to political campaigns.  The call by Bevin comes just over a week after Beshears son Andy, Kentuckys attorney general, sued Bevin in an effort to block funding cuts to public universities that he said are illegal.  Bevin on Tuesday said his administration also has concerns about contracts, some issued through a no-bid process, that may have rewarded family members of Beshears staff. The law firm would have the ability to subpoena witnesses and records, and work closely with the state inspector general, he said. These discoveries ... raise questions that must be answered in an open and transparent way, Bevin, who is the just second Republican elected to the states highest office since 1971, said at a press conference. Only then will the citizens of the commonwealth begin to have confidence in their government. Beshear, who was barred from seeking reelection due to term limits, strongly denied the charges in a Facebook post. There was never any attempt to pressure employees to make political contributions, and we followed both the spirit and the letter of procurement laws, he said, adding Bevins move was a pathetic spectacle. Andy Beshear said Bevin was not properly pursuing the issue. The attorney general said in a statement Tuesday that he agreed issues such as no-bid contracts should be scrutinized, including a pair awarded by Bevins administration.       The governor is once again overstating his authority, Beshear said, adding that the Kentucky Executive Branch Ethics Commission and not the cabinet was the appropriate agency for any such probe. Before taking office in December, Bevin called Steve Beshears appointment of his wife to an unpaid seat on the state horse park commission an embarrassment. Meanwhile, the former governor has launched a campaign against Bevins healthcare initiatives. ",1.0

A deal to attempt to limit the rise in global temperatures to less than 2C has been agreed at the climate change summit in Paris after two weeks of intense negotiations. The pact is the first to commit all countries to cut carbon emissions. The agreement is partly legally binding and partly voluntary. Earlier, key blocs, including the G77 group of developing countries, and nations such as China and India said they supported the proposals. President of the UN climate conference of parties (COP) and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said:  I now invite the COP to adopt the decision entitled Paris Agreement outlined in the document.  Looking out to the room I see that the reaction is positive, I see no objections. The Paris agreement is adopted. As he struck the gavel to signal the adoption of the deal, delegates rose to their feet cheering and applauding.John Kerry told fellow negotiators,  it will help the world prepare for the impacts of climate change that are already here and also for those that we already know are on our way inevitably.

And they will look to December 12, 2015, as the day when the community of nations finally made the decision to act. South African environment minister Edna Molewa calls the pact  the best we can get at this historic moment.  She says it  can map a turning point to a better and safer world  but she added that developed countries still have to cut emissions more and help poorer nations to counter the effects of global warming.READ MORE: BBCRead more: AP",0.0

He proves through his actions that we shouldn t be afraid to act as a humble servant of the Lord.

Obama s speech was not geared towards healing a torn and divided community. His speech was about promoting his radical gun-control agenda.

"U.S. lawmakers back Syria strikes, demand a plan from Trump","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Members of the U.S. Congress from both parties on Friday backed President Donald Trumps cruise missile strikes on Syria, but demanded he develop a strategy for dealing with the broader conflict and consult with Congress on any further action. In the biggest foreign policy decision of his presidency, Trump ordered the firing of cruise missiles at a Syrian air base that U.S. officials said was the launching point for a deadly chemical weapons attack against Syrian civilians this week. The strike was well planned, well executed. It was certainly more than a pinprick, and sends a message ... that using chemical weapons again is not something (Syrian president Bashar al-Assad) can do with impunity, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told a news conference. McConnell said Vice President Mike Pence had called him to explain the rationale for the strikes. It was one of a series of calls by administration officials to members of Congress beginning shortly before the strikes and extending until after midnight on Thursday evening. Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was called by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Trump himself. After seeing the devastation in Syria and visiting refugee camps, he said he became emotional when he heard the news. When I talked to the president last night, I told him how proud I was of our country. And him, Corker said. Democratic Senator Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Trumps Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, had called. I am hopeful these strikes will convince the Assad regime that such actions should never be repeated, Warner said in a statement. Partisan debate over how to deal with Syria has been bitter. In 2013, then-President Barack Obama ran into stiff resistance from many Republicans, including McConnell, when he proposed military action to retaliate for a chemical attack that crossed Obamas red line. Many Democrats, some of whom had paid a political penalty for backing Republican President George W. Bushs war in Iraq, also opposed intervention. Obamas abrupt decision not to fire missiles and instead work with Russia to remove Assads chemical weapons infuriated many Republicans who had backed the Democratic presidents proposal. The conflict in Syria has now dragged on for seven years, devastating the country, destabilizing the region and leaving millions homeless. Republican Senator Marco Rubio said he wanted a broader strategy. I would love to have one yesterday, or the day before. Id like to have one already but Id rather them design it correctly than not, he said, leaving a briefing by General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Most lawmakers insisted Trump should seek Congress approval for any additional military action. Congress must live up to its Constitutional responsibility to debate an Authorization of the Use of Military Force against a sovereign nation, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi wrote in a letter asking Speaker Paul Ryan to call the House of Representatives back to Washington to debate a formal authorization to use military force. The House is not due to return until late April. Republican Senator Rand Paul, a member of the foreign relations committee, called the Syria strikes illegal. Under the U.S. Constitution, declarations of war require congressional approval. Weve had no chance to weigh or weigh in on whether we should do it or not, Paul told reporters. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, another committee member, said that if Congress does not assert itself now, it risked losing its constitutional right to declare war. I think its devastating to the future role of Congress in foreign affairs. If we dont authorize this action, I dont see why any president would ever come to Congress, Murphy said. ",1.0
" REPORT: Trump Tried To Pull His Own Saturday Night Massacre, WH Aides Said Hell No","Donald Trump has to be the most corrupt  president  America has ever seen. After his infamous firing of FBI Director James Comey over the investigation into his campaign s ties to Russia, Trump was reportedly infuriated that his racist elf of an Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, recused himself from all things related to Russia. Then, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein saw fit to appoint former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a Special Counsel to get to the bottom of the Russia matter. Now, it seems that Mueller, who enjoys broad bipartisan support and has an impeccable reputation in Washington, is now in Trump s crosshairs. In fact, it is now being reported that Trump wanted to fire Mueller, and was only stopped by his own White House staff, because any thinking person knows that this would be a political   and potentially legal- disaster.The rumors of Trump s intention to fire Mueller were first fueled by an interview that Newsmax CEO and close Trump confidante Christopher Ruddy gave to PBS Newshour. In that interview, Ruddy said of what he knew of Trump s paranoid thinking on the matter: I think he s considering perhaps terminating the special counsel. I think he s weighing that option. Well, Trump had better get that option out of his head; after all, even the GOP sycophants in Congress are saying that this is a bridge too far, and that Trump needs to leave Special Counsel Mueller alone and let him do his investigation. Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA), who is the Ranking Member on the House Intelligence Committee has already told Trump that going after Mueller would be a waste of time, because Congress would intervene.If President fired Bob Mueller, Congress would immediately re-establish independent counsel and appoint Bob Mueller. Don't waste our time.  Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) June 12, 2017Trump is acting like Richard Nixon did toward the end of Watergate.

Obama administration asks Supreme Court to rehear immigration case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a last-ditch effort to revive a White House plan to protect up to 4 million immigrants from deportation, the Obama administration on Monday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to rehear a case on which the eight-member court was split 4-4 last month. The June 23 high court decision left in place a lower court ruling that blocked the plan, which has never been in effect. The court is currently one justice short following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February. In a filing, the Justice Department asked the court to take a second look at the case once it has a full complement of nine justices. It is unclear when that would be, as the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate has declined to act on Obamas nominee, appeals court judge Merrick Garland. As such, even if the Supreme Court was to grant the request, it is unlikely to rule on the case until well after Obama leaves office in January. Acknowledging that the high court rarely rehears cases, Acting Solicitor General Ian Gershengorn said the immigration case is unique because the court could not in future take another case to resolve the issue if the plan is blocked. The high court should be the final arbiter of these matters through a definitive ruling, he wrote. Obama unveiled his plan in November 2014. It was quickly challenged in court by Republican-governed Texas and 25 other states that argued that Obama overstepped the powers granted to him by the U.S. Constitution by infringing upon the authority of Congress. Because we are right on the law, we have prevailed at every stage in this case, and we are confident that we will continue to prevail, said Marc Rylander, a spokesman for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.  As a result of the high courts 4-4 split, a 2015 lower-court ruling invalidating Obamas plan was left in place. The plan never was implemented because the lower courts had blocked it. The plan was tailored to let roughly 4 million people - those who have lived illegally in the United States at least since 2010, have no criminal record and have children who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents - get into a program that shields them from deportation and supplies work permits. Obama took the action after Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives killed bipartisan immigration legislation that was passed by the Senate in 2013. ",1.0

Senate may keep some Obamacare taxes in U.S. healthcare overhaul,"Washington (Reuters) - Republican senators trying to repeal Obamacare are forming  consensus to keep some of the U.S. healthcare laws taxes they long criticized, in hopes of delaying more drastic funding cuts, particularly to the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled.  First proposed by moderate Republicans, the idea is gaining traction among party members, according to five sources involved in or briefed on internal discussions. While no final decisions have been made, a sense of urgency has increased as Republicans draft a replacement bill to former President Barack Obamas healthcare law before Congress goes on recess on June 30. But keeping some of the taxes in the Senate bill risks alienating conservatives. On Tuesday, 45 conservative groups and activists sent a letter to Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, urging the Senate to repeal all Obamacare taxes. One cornerstone tax that could remain is the net investment income tax, which imposes a 3.8 percent surtax on capital gains, dividends and interest, the sources said. The taxes most likely to be abolished directly impact consumers and the health industry, including a tax on health insurance premiums, the so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost employer-provided insurance and the medical device tax. Another proposal being floated is to keep all the taxes from the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, but to scale them back. A group of 13 Republican senators led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not completed a full draft of the bill, but is sending pieces to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to assess the impact of various provisions. The CBOs assessment will help determine which taxes the Senate needs in order to pay for its replacement bill. It is not clear whether McConnell, or more conservative party members such as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Mike Lee of Utah, are receptive to keeping some of the taxes. I think most of the taxes are going to go away, Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the Senates No. 3-ranking Republican, said on Tuesday. Our members are still having a conversation about if we want to make changes that are in the end going to require some additional revenue. Spokesmen for McConnell and Cruz declined to comment. A spokesman for Lee said he wants Republicans to abolish every tax that was included in a 2015 Obamacare repeal bill that Obama vetoed.  Since Obamacare became law in 2010, Republicans have campaigned on repealing the program that extended insurance coverage to 20 million additional Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid. They have argued that the law is too costly and represents undue government interference in Americans healthcare. President Donald Trump promised to eliminate the law on his first day in office, but Republicans, who control the White House, the House of Representatives and the Senate, have struggled to coalesce around a single plan. Under Senate rules, their bill must replicate the $133 billion in savings projected by preliminary legislation that passed in the U.S. House of Representatives last month. That bill would end Obamacares expansion of Medicaid in 2020, slash its federal funding by more than $800 billion over 10 years and eliminate most of the laws taxes. Moderate Republican senators from states that expanded Medicaid, including Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Dean Heller of Nevada, have proposed phasing out the expansion over a seven-year period, from 2020 to 2027, to give state governors more time to cut program costs. That timeframe also prevents senators, who serve six-year terms, from having to run for re-election when Medicaid cuts have been implemented, two former Republican Senate aides said.  Some of Obamacares taxes could also be repealed later when Congress tackles new legislation overhauling the U.S. tax code, two current Senate aides said.  Theres no question that the current debate is not centered on eliminating all the taxes in Obamacare right now, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina said last week. Under a process called reconciliation, the bill needs at least 50 votes to pass, with Vice President Mike Pence casting the tie-breaking vote if needed. In an interview with Reuters last month, McConnell said he did not yet know how he would get enough votes for an Obamacare repeal.

Friday s series of coordinated attacks by Rohingya insurgents on security forces in the north of Myanmar s Rakhine state and ensuing clashes triggered the Rohingya exodus, while the government evacuated thousands of Rakhine Buddhists. Since the attacks, about 18,445 Rohingya - mostly women and children - have registered in Bangladesh, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said on Wednesday.  They are in a very, very desperate condition,  said Sanjukta Sahany, who runs the IOM office in the southern town of Cox s Bazar near the border.  The biggest needs are food, health services and they need shelter. They need at least some cover, some roofs over their heads.   Sahany said many crossed  with bullet injuries and burn injuries,  and that aid workers reported that some refugees  gave a blank look  when questioned.  People are traumatized, which is quite visible.  The United Nations, while condemning the militant attacks, has pressured Myanmar to protect civilian lives without discrimination and appealed to Bangladesh to admit those fleeing the military counteroffensive. At least 109 people have been killed in the clashes with insurgents, Myanmar says, most of them militants but also members of the security forces and civilians. The United Nations Security Council was briefed behind closed doors on Wednesday on the escalating violence at the request of Britain.   There s a lot of concern about the situation in the country. We all condemned the violence, we all called on all the parties to de-escalate,  British U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft told reporters after the briefing.  The treatment of about 1.1 million Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar is the biggest challenge facing national leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been accused by Western critics of not speaking out for a minority that has long complained of persecution. Rycroft said the Security Council looks to Suu Kyi to  to set the right tone and to find the compromises and the de-escalation necessary in order to resolve the conflict.   The Rohingya are denied citizenship in Myanmar and regarded as illegal immigrants, despite claiming roots that date back centuries. The violence marks a dramatic escalation of a conflict that has simmered since October, when a similar, but much smaller, series of Rohingya attacks on security posts prompted a fierce military response, in which the U.N. has said security forces probably committed crimes against humanity.  The situation is very terrifying, houses are burning, all the people ran away from their homes, parents and children were divided, some were lost, some are dead,  Abdullah, 25, a Rohingya from the region of Buthidaung, told Reuters, struggling to hold back tears. Abdullah said four of the six hamlets in his village of Mee Chaung Zay had been burned down by security forces, prompting all its residents to flee toward Bangladesh. He was among the thousands of terrified people who left their village to gather at the foot of the Mayu mountain range. Together with his wife and 5-year-old daughter, Abdullah brought sticky rice, fetched plastic sheets and empty water bottles, preparing to trek in monsoon rain for days on a 20-km (12-mile) route through the mountains to the border.  I am waiting for all of my relatives to leave together with my family as soon as possible,  he added. Myanmar officials have said the country had the right to defend itself from attack, adding that security personnel were told to keep innocent civilians from harm. Mine explosions and fighting continued, the government said, blaming Rohingya militants for burning down houses and fleeing to the mountains after attacks. Bangladesh is already host to more than 400,000 Rohingya refugees who have fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar since the early 1990s.  Dhaka has asked the U.N. to pressure Myanmar over its treatment of the Muslim minority, saying it cannot take any more.  At least 4,000 people were stranded in no man s land between the two countries, with temporary shelters stretching for several hundred meters on a narrow strip between the Naf River and Myanmar s border fence. On Tuesday, Reuters reporters saw women, some carrying children and sick people, wade through the river, which narrows to less than 10 meters (11 yards) there. Bangladeshi border guards allowed groups of about six to cross to reach a stack of donated medicines. Many Rohingya trying to cross were sick and at least six died after crossing over, one aid worker said, adding that some refused to seek help for fear of being caught and sent back. Shaheen Abdur Rahman, a doctor at a hospital in Cox s Bazar, said 15 people admitted since last week had gunshot wounds, varying from grazes to bleeding in the lung. Four serious cases were sent for treatment to nearby Chittagong. Injuries also included fractures that could have been suffered in beatings or accidental falls while fleeing, he said.   We don t discriminate,  said Rahman.  Everyone coming to this hospital, whether they re Bangladeshi or not from Bangladesh, we provide due service to them.  In Kuala Lumpur, capital of neighboring Muslim-majority Malaysia, police said they arrested about 155 of roughly 1,200 mostly Rohingya demonstrators who protested against the renewed violence. Tens of thousands of Rohingya have fled to Malaysia over the years, few with valid travel or identity papers. (For a graphic on Rohingya conflict click tmsnrt.rs/2gjxOdv) ",1.0
 Awesome New App Helps Make Sure We All Continue To Hurt The Trump Brand As Much As Possible,"We re all now living with the horrifying reality that on January 20, 2017, Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States. While there is nothing we can do about that, what we CAN do is make our collective displeasure with Trump and all he stands for heard loud and clear: By voting with our wallets.An anti-Trump group, Democratic Coalition Against Trump, has put out an app for both Apple and Android devices that keeps a handy running list not just of brands that belong to Trump and his family, but also of businesses that support the Trump brand, as well as those who helped this orange buffoon get elected. The group says of the app, via Executive Director Nate Lemur: This app is a first step in our larger Boycott Trump campaign, which will feature a unified grassroots movement centered on holding companies and individuals that help Trump in any way accountable,The campaign is all about empowerment  By doing so we aim to give people a safe and productive way to voice their disapproval of Trump. We ve accepted Trump won the election but that doesn t mean we have to accept everything he stands for. That s not all, either. The group also has drawn up a list of organizations that will be supporting groups that Trump and his rag tag team of bigots are sure to attack during the next four years. You can download the Apple version of the app here, and the Android version here.Also, remember to follow feeds of progressive organizations on Twitter to keep up with the latest ways to join the resistance against Trump s authoritarian plans. America is counting on all of us to speak truth to power, and to not normalize this unthinkable reality. If we all band together, we just might survive the next four years.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",0.0

 These Words From Trumps Own Mouth OBLITERATE His Outreach To Women (VIDEO),"Donald Trump must think women are stupid. Recently, the billionaire s campaign revealed what they pretend is a comprehensive plan to help struggling families after the birth of a child.Sure, Trump has a long and storied history of making sexist remarks about women and generally treating them like trash, but now that he wants to be President, he s going to provide maternity leave. Of course, his plan is not quite all he and his cohorts pretend it to be.First off, men are left out entirely. Sure, it s 2016 when sometimes women work and men take care of the children, or there might be a couple of guys bringing a child into the world through one method or another. Trump s plan, which proposes six weeks of maternity leave and tax credits for stay-at-home mothers, serves only to reinforce the stereotype that a woman s place is in the home cooking dinner and raising the kids and the man s place is to go out and serve as breadwinner. Stay-at-home fathers, in Trump s world, do not exist and should not even be considered for any tax credits and benefits.Part of the problem is that Trump was famously uninvolved in raising his own children. I won t do anything to take care of them,  he told Howard Stern in 2005.  I ll supply funds and she ll take care of the kids. It s not like I m gonna be walking the kids down Central Park. Men simply do not raise children, or so Trump thinks. And, of course, it s probably best to let him think that in case he spawns more. Can you imagine how much more f*cked up his kids would be if he took a direct role in raising them?Of course, his thoughts on pregnant women in the workplace aren t very nice, either. In a 2004 interview with Dateline NBC,  the billionaire explained that while pregnancy is  a wonderful thing for the woman  and her  husband  (the idea of male same-sex couples does not enter into his mind, of course) it s  an inconvenience for the business. And whether people want to say that or not, the fact is it is an inconvenience for a person that is running a business,  he concluded, adding that women  should  feel like they will be replaced if they do not return to work quickly even if they will not necessarily be replaced.Watch Trump trash female employees who have the audacity to get pregnant below: Featured image via screen capture",0.0
 Naked Man Rants About Trump In Times Square,"We all know that Trump supporters are crazy, but a man in New York City s Times Square took it to a whole other level on Thursday. The clearly disturbed man is NYC s 21-year-old Krit McClean. He was reportedly shouting about Donald Trump at the top of a ledge, and was completely naked. Authorities and bystanders stared as he blew kisses at the crowd that stopped to watch the show, and was shouting, Donald Trump where are you! It all started when McClean took to the Square early Thursday morning, stripped naked in front of a Disney Store near 46th street, removed the watch from his wrist, hurled it at a nearby woman, and began shouting incoherently. A security guard told McClean to get dressed, but the order was ignored. He also was combative when police arrived, shouting Get that bitch Debbie, I want to talk to Debbie!  After that, McClean said he needed to meet with Trump.Then, McClean was atop a 16 foot ledge shouting,  Donald Trump where are you, Donald Trump where the f  are you?!  Officers on the scene report that he was grabbing and waving his private parts at them, did some sort of dance, and then jumped from the ledge, but unfortunately missed the safety apparatus that first responders had down below for him, and hit the pavement instead. He was carted off to Bellevue, a psychiatric institution in New York City, and is reportedly in stable condition.Now, this man is clearly mentally ill, but I find it very telling that he appears to be obsessed with Donald Trump, even in the middle of some kind of psychotic break. That isn t to make fun of McClean, of course. It s just a very interesting connection. May he make a full recovery.Featured image via DNA Info",0.0
NEW AGE GURU Dr. Deepak Chopra Says Trump May Be Mentally Retarded [VIDEO],"Pathetic New Age guru and alternative medicine activist Dr. Deepak Chopra attacked Donald Trump Tuesday in an interview on Fox News  The Alan Colmes Show, during which he called the presumptive GOP presidential nominee both  emotionally  and  mentally retarded. Chopra, 68, said that Trump epitomizes, among other things, the  darkest demons  of America s  collective psyche. I would never say this unless I believed it was 100% true, but he represents the racist, the bigot, the one who s prejudiced, the one who is full of fear and hatred, the one who represents emotional retardation of a three-year old,  Chopra said of Trump.  And yet he s so popular because he s given permission to our collective psyche to express their darkest demons. Radio host Colmes asked Chopra if Trump is himself a racist and bigot, or whether he just represents those ideologies to his supporters. I think he is,  Chopra said, adding:  I think he s racist, he s bigoted, he s prejudiced. He s full of fear. He is angry. He has a lot of hatred. He pouts, he s belligerent, he s emotionally retarded. Via: Breitbart News",0.0
 GOP Reps Replacement For Obamacare Is Child Abuse (VIDEO),"When the Affordable Care Act was in deliberation, Republicans showed themselves at their most heartless. Essentially, their view is that healthcare is not a right and should only be available to the people who had the foresight to be born into a wealthy or near wealthy family.Despite the fact that overall, Obamacare has been wildly successful, even with Republicans putting up every obstacle possible, about 24 million people have health insurance and would lose it without the Affordable Care Act. Republicans don t care. One Republican, though, has a solution, but there are two small problems: it s not a solution at all and it s tantamount to child abuse.In an interview with MLive.com, Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-MI) regaled the reporter with a story of how he waited a night to take his son to the doctor, when his son had a broken arm. Somehow, Huizenga thinks that s a good thing. We weren t sure what was going on. It was in the evening, so I splinted it up and we wrapped it up, and the decision was, okay, do we go to the ER? We thought it was a sprain, but weren t sure,  Huizenga said, adding that he and his wife  took every precaution and decided to go in the next morning. When it [comes to] those type of things, do you keep your child home from school and take him the next morning to the doctor because of a cold or a flu, versus take him into the emergency room? If you don t have a cost difference, you ll make different decisions,  he said.Here s the video:Yes, that s the Republican line. People should shop for healthcare. Of course, that s possible with some procedures, but for most, it s not at all. Besides, have you ever tried to pin down actual costs for medical procedures? It s not easy. Hospitals and doctor s offices aren t exactly known for offering full disclosure when it comes to pricing. Many people in this country aren t lucky enough to live in areas where there is even competition.Beyond that, though, waiting to treat a broken arm so you can save a few bucks is child abuse and for those who don t have health insurance, there s often no option but to go to the emergency room.Featured image via video screen capture.

 Parents Ban Black History Month Video From School Because Of White Guilt (VIDEO),"Thanks to a bunch of parents who cannot handle the truth, a Virginia school district was forced to nix an educational video about racism and inequality from its curriculum after receiving complaints that its message was racially divisive.Using the metaphor of a race track, the video expertly addresses racial disparity in America throughout history in which individual runners encounter various obstacles depending on their race. Created by the African American Policy Forum, the short video has been used hundreds of thousands of times all over America without any issues   up until now.Unfortunately, a few parents in Glen Allen felt it was a  white guilt video  and although officials of Henrico County Public Schools originally stood by the film s much-needed message, those ignorant parents got their way. Two days after saying the video was one component of a thoughtful discussion in which all viewpoints were encouraged,  officials had banned the video, labeling it racially divisive.  They even issued an apology for trying to bring cultural awareness to students!School Board Chair Micky Ogburn said: The Henrico School Board and administration consider this to be a matter of grave concern. We are making every effort to respond to our community. It is our goal to prevent the recurrence of this type of event. School leaders have been instructed not to use the video in our schools. In addition, steps are being taken to prevent the use of racially divisive materials in the future. We do apologize to those who were offended and for the unintended impact on our community. Luke Harris, co-founder of the African American Policy Forum, felt the video was completely appropriate. He said: The video is designed for the general public. We produced something you could show in elementary and secondary schools or in college studies courses. We found that the video has a huge impact on the people that we re showing it to. Most of us know very little about the social history of the United States and its contemporary impact. It was designed as a tool to throw light on American history. It s already a shame that black history is only celebrated one month   the shortest month   out of the entire year, and this proves that even educational videos about the real-life struggles of African Americans don t stand a chance against white privilege. This was a great cartoon that made the obstacles of racism (many of which still exist to this day) easy to understand. Out of the four hundred years of slavery and oppression that black people have had to endure, you would think that the least we could do is watch a four-minute cartoon about it.

His comments came after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered new sanctions against North Korea on Thursday over its nuclear and missile programs. ,1.0
NATIONAL TREND? OREGON BEGINS TAXING ELECTRIC CAR DRIVERS BY THE MILE,"The state of Oregon is  hoping  to get 5,000 volunteers for a program that tracks every mile you drive and then charges your credit card for every mile driven. The kicker is that this program might cost more than it takes in because the vendor takes 40% of the profits.  I d like to know how much the device costs the taxpayers and if they ve already purchased 5,000. Then there s the privacy issue when the state tracks your every move. Oregon is using an experimental program to become the first state to tax drivers based on the miles they travel on state roads rather than the gas they purchase.The voluntary program, called OReGo, is designed to capture taxes from hybrid and electric car drivers who have been able to skirt gas taxes.Oregon s Department of Transportation is hoping to get 5,000 people to volunteer to install a small device under their steering wheels that will track their mileage and charge drivers  credit cards one and a half pennies for each mile driven, Fox News reported Friday.Transportation officials say the growing numbers of electric and hybrid cars has left the gas tax flat and unable to fund road maintenance. We re trying to make up for a growing deficit, really, because inflation s eating away at our ability to buy asphalt and rebar and the things we need to maintain the roads,  Tom Fuller of the Oregon Department of Transportation told Fox News.Oregon was the first state to impose a gas tax in 1919. That tax has now reached 30 cents per gallon.Some Oregon drivers want the program to go national to make the tax more fair for all drivers. I ve been free-loading on the highways for 20 years driving electric cars or hybrid cars, getting at least 40 miles to the gallon. So I haven t been paying my fair share,  said Oregon resident David Hastings, Fox reported.But others are raising questions about privacy. Two of the three OReGO systems track and store a car s every move. To put a GPS monitor in everybody s car, the government already knows too much about us as it is,  said Jeff Kruse, a Republican lawmaker, Fox reported.There is also growing concern about the cost of the program. OReGO vendors will collects up to 40 cents of every dollar drivers are charged, and green car drivers could be in for some serious sticker shock every month.Read more: WT",0.0
Russia may widen designation for media outlets it deems 'foreign agents': Ifax,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia may decide to designate any media as  foreign agents  if they are financed by a foreign state or citizen, or by a Russian  organization that gets foreign financing, the Interfax news agency reported on Thursday. Interfax cited a draft regulation from the justice ministry. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law last month that allowed the authorities to designate foreign media outlets as  foreign agents  in response to what Moscow said was unacceptable U.S. pressure on Russian media. So far, it has been exclusively used to label media sponsored by the U.S. authorities as foreign agents, but the new regulation would appear to go further.   Under the existing law media branded  foreign agents  must provide any news they provide to Russians as the work of foreign agents and disclose their funding sources. ",1.0
 American Liar: Wingnut Icon Chris Kyle Wasnt The Hero He Made Himself Out To Be,"There s nobody your standard issue right-wing nutjob loves more than Chris Kyle. His story is the stuff of ammosexual dreams. Not only did he join the military to go fight terrorists, he scored more kills than anyone in Iraq. He also told some blatantly fictitious stories about things he did here at home, but his military career? Not even those darned lefties who think glorifying killing women and children for any reason is wrong could deny what s written in black and white. Ultimately, it seems, it s those same records that will cheapen the legacy of Chris Kyle.An investigation by The Intercept  reveals that while Kyle does have a remarkable military record, it wasn t enough for his ego. In his book, American Sniper, Kyle said: All told I would end my career as a SEAL with two Silver Stars and five Bronze [Stars], all for valor. That s awfully impressive. Unfortunately, it s a lie. According to internal Navy documents, Chris Kyle received one Silver Star and three Bronze Stars. Why anyone would need to embellish a career already that impressive is truly baffling, but Kyle did. Is it really that big of a deal, though? So the guy told a little fibsky what s the harm in that? Apparently, when it comes to Navy SEALS and valor, there is little that is worse. According to The Intercept:Kyle was warned at least once before American Sniper was published that its description of his medal count was wrong, according to one current Navy officer, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak about the case. As Kyle s American Sniper manuscript was distributed among SEALs, one of his former commanders, who was still on active duty, advised Kyle that his claim of having two Silver Stars was false, and he should correct it before his book was published.Current and former Navy SEALs interviewed for this article, who agreed to speak on background because they feared being shunned by their close-knit community, did not dispute Kyle s heroism in combat, but saw the inflation of his medal count as significant because they consider battlefield embellishments to be dishonorable.Not only did Kyle lie, he was called on it. It may have been one thing if he could have claimed he thought he had medals or that,  aw, gee there were so many I got mixed up,  but that time came and went. Not only do Kyle s lies about shooting looters after Katrina or killing carjackers with his 2nd Amendment now get the  pants on fire  rating   his military career is now in question as well. Who is to say that he didn t embellish other things? The man was obviously constitutionally incapable of telling the truth.Maybe it s a good thing. Maybe a few fewer women and children met their end with what Kyle called  180 grains of justice. Featured image by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram/Getty Images",0.0
U.S. extends some Iran sanctions relief under nuclear deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday extended some sanctions relief for Iran under the 2015 nuclear deal but said it has yet to decide whether to preserve the deal itself, the State Department said. President Donald Trump, who must make a decision by mid-October that could undermine the agreement, said Iran is violating  the spirit  of the 2015 deal under which Iran got sanctions relief in return for curbing its nuclear program. In a sign of Trump s desire to put pressure on Iran, which denies violating the deal, the U.S. Treasury announced new cyber-related and other sanctions on seven Iranian individuals, two Iranian entities and two Ukraine-based entities.  We are not going to stand for what they are doing,  Trump told reporters on Air Force One. But he stopped short of saying whether he will refuse to recertify the agreement. Trump must decide in October whether to certify that Iran is complying with the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). If he does not, Congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal. The prospect of Washington reneging on the agreement has worried some of the key U.S. allies that helped negotiate the deal, especially as the world grapples with another nuclear crisis, North Korea s nuclear and ballistic missile development. Republican Senator Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and wrote the law giving Congress the right to review the Iran deal, said he and the White House were preparing in case of a change in policy. He also said he recognized the need to work with allies.  I think it s important that ... we take steps that, to the extent we can, we keep all of our allies together,  Corker told Reuters.  What you don t want to do is self-create a crisis for no reason. You want to make sure that you have an outcome here that is a good outcome for the United States and our interest.  Asked if it made sense to abandon the Iran nuclear deal given concerns about North Korea, Corker said,  I don t think you should prejudge what they re (the administration) going to do.  Separately, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson argued that the United States must consider the full threat it says Iran poses to the Middle East when formulating its new policy toward Tehran, saying Iran had breached the spirit of the deal.  We have to consider the totality of Iran s activities and not let our view be defined solely by the nuclear agreement,  he told a news conference in London. Citing the preface to the 2015 agreement, Tillerson said  in our view, Iran is clearly in default of these expectations.  He cited Iranian support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, its development of ballistic missiles and  cyber activities.  The deal s preface does not oblige Iran to promote global peace. Rather, it says the nations involved  anticipate that full implementation of this JCPOA will positively contribute to regional and international peace and security.  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters the administration had approved waivers of some sanctions on Iran to  maintain some flexibility  as it develops its Iran policy. She did not specify which sanctions were waived. Earlier, sources said the United States will renew a waiver of the most punitive sanctions on Iran. Tucked into Section 1245 of the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act, Washington threatened to sanction the banks of Iran s main oil customers if they did not significantly cut their purchases of Iranian crude. Under the law, these sanctions can be waived for a maximum of 120 days, forcing the U.S. government to revisit the issue every four months. Even as the administration waived the oil-related sanctions, the Treasury Department announced it had sanctioned 11 entities and individuals for  engaging in support of designated Iranian actors or malicious cyber-enabled activity.  Of the 11, seven were Iranian individuals, two were Iranian entities and two were entities based in Ukraine. The Treasury alleged they either supported Iran s ballistic missile program or its Quds Force, or engaged in cyber attacks against the U.S. financial system. The action freezes any assets they may hold in the United States and generally prohibits U.S. individuals from doing business with them. ",1.0
PBS HOST ASKS HILLARY:Do You Believe The President Is Racist?Her Answer Proves That She Is The REAL Racist [VIDEO],"PBS host Judy Woodroof asked Hillary if she believed President Trump is racist? Hillary pauses for effect and then delivers her very scripted answer to Woodruff:  Here s what I believe, I believe that he has given a lot of encouragement and rhetorical support to the Ku Klux Klan, he accepted the support of David Duke. Hillary knowingly pushed the lie that Trump accepted the support of KKK member David Duke. It s the same lie she s been peddling since Trump became her opponent in the presidential race, even though she knows there isn t one shred of evidence or proof to back up her sick claim. Her answer to Woodruff is nothing more than a lame attempt to pin Trump a false allegation on our sitting President while deflecting from the truth about her ACTUAL ties to the KKK. Watch Hillary attempt to paint President Trump as a  racist .When President Trump was dropping out of the Reform Party primary in 2000, he clearly condemned David Duke during an interview with Matt Lauer.When pressed by Matt Lauer on why he saw the Reform Party as self-destructing, Trump commented: Well, you ve got David Duke just joined, a bigot, a racist, a problem, I mean, this is not exactly the people you want in your party. Watch Trump s 2000 interview with Lauer here:What Hillary Clinton didn t mention to Judy Woodruff during her interview, was that her presidential campaign received more than $20,000 in donations contributed by members of the Ku Klux Klan. Vocativ reported that a prominent member of the hate group Will Quigg of the California Grand Dragon for the Loyal White Knights said,  For the KKK, Clinton is our choice . Mr. Quigg, the leader of the Klan s California chapter, announced last month that he had abandoned supporting Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump in lieu of backing his likely Democratic opponent. The Klansman claims that members have raised more than $20,000 for Mrs. Clinton and have donated it anonymously to her campaign.  She is friends with the Klan,  Mr. Quigg told Vocativ.  A lot of people don t realize that. Hillary never made any secret of her love and admiration for her  mentor,  the late Klan leader Democrat Senator, Robert Byrd.In a video uploaded to the State Department s official YouTube page on June 28, 2010, Clinton commemorated late Sen. Byrd by saying,  Today our country has lost a true American original, my friend and mentor Robert C. Byrd. ",0.0
 American Racism Reaches New Heights Of Hypocrisy,"For the last couple of months, I ve been seeing numerous stories about the increasing rate of death among middle-aged whites. As a middle-aged white person myself I was curious, so I ve been looking at the articles. As I did so, I noticed an interesting trend. See if you can spot it:A week after it was published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a paper by the Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton showing that middle-aged white Americans are dying in much larger numbers than they used to is still the talk of the town.   The New YorkerSomething startling is happening to middle-aged white Americans.   NY TimesBirth of a Plague   NewsweekAnd here s the most recent and perfect example: according to new research into a crisis that is increasingly worrying healthcare officials and policymakers.   LA TimesIsn t it amazing how white people dying is suddenly a HUGE problem that needs to be addressed? Apparently, much of the spike is attributable to drugs, drinking, suicide and lack of proper healthcare. That, in turn, is attributable to the Great Recession as millions of people s lives were destroyed by forces outside of their control.Not to belittle their suffering (much) but boohoo. The black community has been dealing with this kind of widespread economic destruction for decades. There s a reason that every other corner in a ghetto is a liquor store (drive through parts of D.C. and you ll see what I mean) and drug use is rampant and it s not because black people are morally deficient as some people (conservatives) would like you to believe.But now that white people are facing the same levels of despair and lack of opportunity, they re responding in much the same way and America is very VERY concerned about their welfare. We need to DO SOMETHING about this crisis!This hypocrisy ties into the sudden about face on the war on drugs. Once upon a time, society needed to throw every drug user into to jail for decades at a time to protect society. That most of those arrested just happened to be black was just a coincidence, surely. These days, however, drug use has exploded in white neighborhoods as meth and heroin use are skyrocketing.But instead of demands for more mass incarceration, we hear pleas for mercy and understanding. We have to DO SOMETHING to help these poor victims.But only the white ones.If your blood isn t boiling right now, you haven t been paying attention. MuriKKKa.Featured image via micetrap ",0.0
U.S. urges EU hopeful Albania to get tough with 'big fish' of crime,"TIRANA (Reuters) - The United States urged its NATO ally Albania on Monday to start jailing bosses of organized crime if it hopes to make headway in its bid to join the European Union.   U.S. ambassador Donald Lu said fighting organized crime and corruption was  the biggest and most difficult challenge ahead  for the ex-communist Balkan country, which officially became an EU candidate in 2014 and hopes to begin accession talks soon.   Until the big fish are arrested, prosecuted and go to jail, the cannabis will return, judges will be bribed, and government officials will be corrupted,  Lu told a gathering of judges and aspiring magistrates.    Citing U.S. reports, Lu described Albania as  a center of organized crime activity, which includes trafficking in drugs, weapons and prostitution . He said four major clans in Albania controlled 20 families involved in a wide range of criminal activities.  Albania has a substantial black market for smuggled goods, primarily tobacco, jewelry, stolen cars and mobile phones. The country remains at significant risk for money laundering because of rampant corruption and a weak legal system,  Lu said. Despite efforts to clean up the judiciary under EU pressure, a hit-and-run incident involving an armored car belonging to a powerful businessman and a police chief in the central town of Elbasan in September demonstrated again how some groups continue to see themselves as above the law. After the incident, police stepped up their seizure of suspicious luxury cars, confiscating 17 armored cars.  Lu said he was troubled to see no major drug traffickers arrested or prosecuted in 2015 or 2016 when there was a sharp increase in the cultivation of cannabis in Albania. ",1.0
State Department website posts article on Trump's Florida resort,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. State Department website on Monday took down an article it published this month about President Donald Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort which had prompted criticism from prominent ethics experts that the piece represented use of public office for private gain. The original article was posted on April 4 on the Share America website, overseen by the State Departments Bureau of International Information Programs. It was also shared on the websites and social media pages of several U.S. embassies, including those in the United Kingdom, Portugal and Albania, as well as the State Departments Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs. Although it was posted weeks ago, the article surfaced on Monday when it was shared widely on social media. The State Department removed the articles content around 7 p.m. on Monday, replacing it with a short statement saying its intention was to inform the public about where the President has been hosting world leaders. We regret any misperception and have removed the post.     The article described the history of Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, and its size, status as a registered historic site, interior decoration and oceanfront location. By visiting this winter White House, Trump is belatedly fulfilling the dream of Mar-a-Lagos original owner and designer, socialite and cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, the article said. Posts dream of a winter White House came true with Trumps election in 2016. A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the White House did not know about the article in advance, and declined to comment further. Norman Eisen, ethics chief under Trumps predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama, said on Twitter that the article violated a federal statute barring the use of public office for private gain. Richard Painter, a former ethics lawyer for Republican President George W. Bush, said on Twitter that the post constituted use of public office for private gain pure and simple. Scott Amey, an attorney with the nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight, said the post may not be an outright endorsement of Mar-a-Lago, but that someone inside of the government should have said no to the story and further helping Trump make money while serving in the White House. The Share America article said that in 1973, Post willed the estate to the U.S. government, intending it to be used as a winter White House for the president to entertain foreign dignitaries. But Presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter never used the property, and in 1981 the government returned the estate to the Post Foundation because it was costing too much to maintain, according to the article. Trump, a businessman turned politician, bought the property in 1985, and turned it into a club open to dues-paying members 10 years later, it said.  The club has a $200,000 membership fee, and Trump has hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the resort. Trumps frequent visits there have come under scrutiny due to their expense and questions of how he has handled sensitive national security information while there. Trump maintains ownership of his global business empire, though he has handed off control to his two oldest sons, an arrangement that ethics watchdogs said would not prevent conflicts of interest.

Trump campaign manager charged with misdemeanor battery against reporter,"(Reuters) - Donald Trumps presidential campaign manager was arrested and charged with misdemeanor battery in Florida on Tuesday in an incident involving a reporter, the latest chapter in a raucous U.S. race marked by threats, insults and physical confrontations. Police in Jupiter, Florida, charged Corey Lewandowski, 42, with intentionally grabbing and bruising the arm of Michelle Fields, then a reporter for the conservative news outlet Breitbart, when she tried to question Trump at a campaign event on March 8. Republican front-runner Trump repeatedly defended Lewandowski throughout a day of campaigning in Wisconsin. He also rescinded a previous pledge to support the Republican presidential nominee if it is not him. No, not anymore, he said when asked if he would honor his previous pledge. At a CNN town hall on Tuesday night, Trump said he would remain loyal to his campaign manager and that Lewandowski would remain on the job even though it might be more convenient on behalf of his campaign to terminate this man, ruin his life, ruin his family ... ruin his whole everything and say: Youre fired. Trump also questioned Fields original description of the incident in which she said she was almost yanked to the ground by Lewandowski. He wondered aloud if she had posed a threat to him because she approached him with an ink pen. She had a pen in her hand that couldve been a knife, Trump said. Police released a video of the incident showing Fields walking alongside Trump and trying to question him. Lewandowski is seen grabbing her arm and pulling her backward. Previous videos of the incident had been obscured by people in the crowd. At the time, Lewandowski called Fields delusional and said he never touched her. Campaign rallies for Trump, the billionaire businessman who leads the race to become the Republican candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election, are tumultuous at times and have been marked by occasional clashes between protesters and supporters or security personnel. His pugnacious campaign style, which includes personal insults directed at rivals and scathing criticism of protesters, has been criticized for encouraging physical altercations at his rallies. Trump leads rivals Ted Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, and Ohio Governor John Kasich in opinion polls and in the number of delegates to the nominating convention, despite a concerted effort to stop him by a Republican establishment worried he will lead the party to defeat in November. Cruz said Trump of course should ask for Lewandowskis resignation. Look, it shouldnt be complicated that members of the campaign staff shouldnt be physically assaulting the press, Cruz said on the CNN town hall. Kasich said he considered such behavior totally and completely inappropriate. If it was me, if I was in this circumstance, I would take some sort of action, either suspension or firing, Kasich told reporters in Wisconsin. Cruz picked up the endorsement on Tuesday of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker ahead of the states primary next week. Walker, who dropped out of the presidential race last year, called Cruz a principled constitutional conservative. Im all in, Walker said in an interview on WTMJ radio in Milwaukee, adding he was not endorsing Cruz in an attempt to stop Trump. I just fundamentally believe if you look at the facts, if you look at the numbers, that Ted Cruz is in the best position by far to both win the nomination of the Republican Party and to then go on and defeat Hillary Clinton in the fall this year, Walker said, referring to the Democratic front-runner. Walker joins a number of other more establishment  Republicans who have backed Cruz as an alternative to Trump, who has racked up a strong delegate lead but alienated many party leaders with his harsh views on illegal immigration, Muslims and women. On his plane, Trump said Fields had been pursuing him after a news conference and Lewandowski was trying to get her off me. He questioned whether Lewandowski had given Fields the bruise on her arm. How do you know those bruises werent there before? he asked reporters in Wisconsin. Republican strategist Katie Packer, who runs an anti-Trump Super PAC, said the incident and the charges against Lewandowski reflected the candidates lack of respect toward women. He doesnt have the kind of values and the kind of temperament that we should expect from someone who wants to be commander in chief, she said. Lewandowski was charged with simple battery, defined under Florida law as intentionally touching or striking a person against their will. For a first offense, it is a misdemeanor in the first degree, which carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison or a fine of $1,000.  A court date was set for May 4, according to the police report. Jupiter police said Lewandowski turned himself in, and he was issued a notice requiring him to appear in court and then released. He was not booked into the jail.  Lewandowskis lawyer, Scott Richardson of West Palm Beach, Florida, declined to comment on whether his client would step down as campaign manager. Lewandowski will also be represented by Kendall Coffey, a Miami lawyer, the campaign said.  Fields resigned from Breitbart less than a week after the incident, citing what she said was the online news outlets refusal to stand behind her amid the allegations. ",1.0
"MEET CLASSY F*ck the police, F*ck the NRA, F*ck the law Professor Who Met With Obama After Speech","What a nice role model for young Americans who hope to someday grow up to be a Saul Alinsky radical just like Barack Hussein Obama, aka Barry Sotoero. Don t you think America is owed an explanation as to why this scumbag was able to meet with Obama following his speech a couple days ago in Omaha? A University of Nebraska-Omaha university professor who used a December 28 Facebook tirade to say  F**k the law,   F**k police,  and  F**k the NRA  was allowed to meet President Obama after his January 13 speech in Omaha.The professor s name is Amanda Gailey. She is also the director of Nebraskans Against Gun Violence.Here is Gailey s Facebook rant in it s entirety:F**k the society that has allowed itself to become so saturated in guns that it s plausible a child might have one at a park. F**k the laws that allow toy makers to make toys that look like real guns and that allow gun makers to make guns that look like toys. F**k racists who think black children look like adults. F**k a legal and police system that allows grown white men to pose with sniper rifles on a university campus or in a grocery store and allows insurrectionists to train guns on government agents with no consequences but sounds the alarms when a black child is carrying a toy gun. F**k police officers who undertook a job that carries inherent risk but think any perceived threat to them whatsoever justifies instantaneous lethal force. F**k police officers who pull up as close as possible to an alleged threat so that they can execute the person as quickly as possible without assessing the situation first. F**k prosecutors who can indict a ham sandwich but can t indict a cop who executed a child. And f**k the NRA for greasing this machine every fucking day with the blood of American children.On January 14 weeks after the original post was put up Gailey put up another post in which she attempted to explain that her criticism of police was limited to  bad-apple officers,  not good ones. And she was specifically outraged by the fact that the no charges were filed against officers who shot 195 pound, 12-year-old Tamir Rice after a 911 dispatcher told officers  a young man [was] playing with a weapon and pointing it at people outside of a local recreation center. Gailey wrote:I did write a Facebook post that expressed my outrage at the police shooting of a 12-year-old child and the failure to indict the bad-apple police officers involved. My criticism of the police was limited to those officers who engage in that kind of policing, which I believe is clear in my post. I did not malign the police in general, nor did I want to, because I respect the many good officers who serve our communities and have even helped me in the past. I know that most police officers are doing hard work in hard conditions, and they are in the front lines of a society saturated in guns, facing threats that police in our peer nations do not. They are key players in our struggle for safe and fair communities.This is Gailey s explanation for  F**k the police  as well as  F**k the society,   F**k the laws,  and  F**k the NRA,  among other things.

"Trump to give major North Korea speech, then press China to do more","SEOUL (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will wrap up his visit to Seoul on Wednesday with a major speech on North Korea and then shift focus to China, where he is expected to press a reluctant President Xi Jinping to tighten the screws further on Pyongyang,  U.S. officials say. Trump s address to South Korea s National Assembly will come a day after he seemed to take a more balanced approach: threatening to use America s full military might against North Korea if needed, but also offering it a diplomatic opening to  make a deal  to end the nuclear standoff. While Trump presented no specific solution to his toughest global security challenge, his more conciliatory rhetoric toward North Korea could help lower tensions between Washington and Pyongyang that have put much of the east Asian region on edge over the prospects for military conflict. It contrasted markedly with Trump s earlier threats to  totally destroy  North Korea if it threatened the United States, and the personal insults he exchanged with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. It remains to be seen, however, whether the unpredictable Trump, in his final day on North Korea s doorstep, will build  on this approach or return to the bellicose language that has characterized his handling of the North Korean issue. Trump s official  talking points  for his Asia tour show that he intends to use the speech in part to contrast South Korea s  amazing rise  with North Korea s  sad, backward  state  and to urge resolve against Pyongyang, according to a confidential document reviewed by Reuters. He is also expected to condemn Pyongyang for its poor human rights record. Trump will then fly to Beijing where, according to senior administration officials, he will try to convince Xi to squeeze North Korea further with steps such as limits on oil exports, coal imports and financial transactions. Previewing his Beijing visit, Trump told a news conference in Seoul on Tuesday that China and North Korea s other giant neighbor, Russia, were among countries whose cooperation will be  crucial in getting North Korea to rein in its nuclear and missile programs.  President Xi   has been very helpful. We ll find out how helpful soon,  Trump said. But it is far from clear if Xi, who has just consolidated his power at a Communist Party congress, will agree to do more. China says its leverage over Pyongyang is exaggerated by the West, and points to its support in the U.N. Security Council for recent sanctions on North Korea as evidence that it is doing all it can to curtail the isolated nation s nuclear and missile tests.  On this issue, China s position and stance is already very clear and staunch,  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Monday.  Everyone can see clearly that we don t need anybody to tell us what we should be doing.  But with Trump appearing to crack open the  door to diplomacy with North Korea   something that China has long urged   he may have a better chance of securing further promises to intensify economic pressure on North Korea, which relies on Beijing for more than 90 percent of its trade. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, however, has seemed willing to risk snubbing China when he deems it useful as he pursues development of a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. At the same time, Xi may be mindful that Trump has held off on trade actions against China that he loudly threatened during the 2016 presidential campaign to give Beijing more time to make progress on North Korea. For his part, Xi will also be looking to maintain the good personal chemistry the two leaders developed when Trump hosted him at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in April. The  bromance  is set to continue when Xi returns the favor by laying on a lavish welcome for Trump s visit starting on Wednesday. Trump is expected to go to the Forbidden City, possibly guided by Xi, and participate in an inspection of Chinese troops, though China has released few other details. ",1.0

These things cannot happen in a democracy."" @FoxBusiness @LizMacDonaldFOX pic.twitter.com/tMkX7wBoA9  Risk & Reward (@RiskRewardFBN) December 14, 2017THERE ARE SEVERAL PLAYERS IN THIS ANTI-TRUMP SCAM BUT FBI AGENT STRZOK IS THE MAIN CULPRIT:FBI Supervisor Fired For Anti-Trump Texts Oversaw Michael Flynn Interviews:Wow! Could this charade of an investigation into Trump-Russian collusion get any more embarrassing for special counsel Robert Mueller?A supervisory special agent who is now under scrutiny after being removed from Robert Mueller s Special Counsel s Office for alleged bias against President Trump also oversaw the bureau s interviews of embattled former National Security advisor Michael Flynn, this reporter has learned. Flynn recently pled guilty to one-count of lying to the FBI last week.FBI agent Peter Strzok was one of two FBI agents who interviewed Flynn, which took place on Jan. 24, at the White House, said several sources. The other FBI special agent, who interviewed Flynn, is described by sources as a field supervisor in the  Russian Squad, at the FBI s Washington Field Office,  according to a former intelligence official, with knowledge of the interview.Strzok was removed from his role in the Special Counsel s Office after it was discovered he had made disparaging comments about President Trump in text messages between him and his alleged lover FBI attorney Lisa Page, according to the New York Times and Washington Post, which first reported the stories. Strzok is also under investigation by the Department of Justice Inspector General for his role in Hillary Clinton s email server and the ongoing investigation into Russia s election meddling. On Saturday, the House Intelligence Committee s Chairman Devin Nunes chided the Justice Department and the FBI for not disclosing why Strzok had been removed from the Special Counsel three months ago, according to a statement given by the Chairman.The former U.S. intelligence official told this reporter,  with the recent revelation that Strzok was removed from the Special Counsel investigation for making anti-Trump text messages it seems likely that the accuracy and veracity of the 302 of Flynn s interview as a whole should be reviewed and called into question. The most logical thing to happen would be to call the other FBI Special Agent present during Flynn s interview before the Grand Jury to recount his version,  the former intelligence official added.The former official also said that  Strzok s allegiance to (Deputy Director Andrew) McCabe was unwavering and very well known. Flynn, a retired three-star general, issued a statement on Dec. 1, saying,  it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of  treason  and other outrageous acts. Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for. But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. According to another source, with direct knowledge of the Jan. 24 interview, McCabe had contacted Flynn by phone directly at the White House. White House officials had spent the  earlier part of the week with the FBI overseeing training and security measures associated with their new roles so it was no surprise to Flynn that McCabe had called,  the source said.McCabe told Flynn  some agents were heading over (to the White House) but Flynn thought it was part of the routine work the FBI had been doing and said they would be cleared at the gate,  the source said. It wasn t until after they were already in (Flynn s) office that he realized he was being formerly interviewed. He didn t have an attorney with him,  they added.Flynn s attorney Robert Kelner did not respond for comment.A former FBI agent said the investigation into Strzok and the reported text messages between him and Page, shows a  bias that cannot be ignored particularly if he had anything to do with Flynn s interview and his role in it. The former U.S. intelligence official questioned,  how logical is it that Flynn is being charged for lying to an agent whose character and neutrality was called into question by the Special Counsel. According to an anonymous source in The Washington Post, Strzok s and Page had exchanged a number of texts that  expressed anti-Trump sentiments and other comments that appeared to favor Clinton.

Clinton to propose creation of immigrant affairs office,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton on Wednesday will propose the creation of a new national Office of Immigrant Affairs should she win the White House in November, as she seeks to woo minority and immigrant voters in New York less than a week before the states primary. The office would coordinate policies and programs among federal agencies and with state and local governments, Clinton said at an event in New York City where she met with immigrant-rights activists. Its an issue that cuts across all levels of government, she said. She added that it would expand the efforts of President Barack Obamas Task Force on New Americans, which was created in 2014 to help immigrants and refugees integrate better into the United States. In contrast, Republican candidates have largely proposed tougher immigration rules. Republican front-runner Donald Trump has called for building a wall along the border with Mexico and a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. The New York primary on Tuesday could either help former Secretary of State Clinton consolidate her status as the Democratic front-runner or hand a significant victory to rival Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator seeking to defy expectations and win the partys nomination for the Nov. 8 election. Both candidates are campaigning across the state, looking to win over New Yorks diverse population, including voters from immigrant families. Around 19 percent of the states population is Hispanic or Latino, according to the U.S. Census. With 247 pledged delegates at stake, the state is among the most significant nominating contests left on the calendar before the Democrats July 25-28 convention in Philadelphia. Clinton holds a double-digit lead in opinion polls over Sanders in New York, the state where he was born and which she served for eight years as a U.S. senator. She also holds a commanding lead in pledged delegates overall so far, leaving Sanders only a narrow path if he is to win the nomination out from under her, a task some pundits say is already beyond him. A Democratic candidate needs 2,383 delegates to clinch the nomination. Those can come from any combination of pledged delegates won in primaries and caucuses, as well as so-called superdelegates, who can vote as they choose.    ",1.0
 Will Smith GOES OFF In Furious Rant Against Trump And His Supporters (TWEETS),"When Donald Trump isn t getting blasted for his disrespectful comments about Muslim soldiers who died sacrificing their lives for America, the disgraced Republican nominee is being reminded of what awful things he s said about other groups.Thanks to actor Will Smith, this time it s women. In a recent interview, Smith reminded everyone that Trump s infamous misogyny and sexism are not to be forgotten amongst all of the other groups of people The Donald offends in any given week. Smith ripped Trump and his followers a new one when he said: For a man to be able to publicly refer to a woman as a fat pig, that makes me teary. And for people to applaud, that is absolutely f*cking insanity to me. Smith specifically is making reference to Trump s comments about Rosie O Donnell, but we all know Trump s anti-women remarks go far beyond her. In the past, Trump has also attacked Arianna Huffington, calling her a  dog  and tweeting that she s  unattractive both inside and out.  And let s not forget Trump s well-known feud with Fox News  Megyn Kelly.TwitterTwitterBut Smith didn t stop there. He continued to get more outraged, saying: My grandmother would have smacked my teeth out of my head if I had referred to a woman as a fat pig. And I cannot understand how people can clap for that. It s absolutely collective insanity If one of my sons, I am getting furious just thinking about it, if one of my sons said that in a public place, they couldn t even live in my house anymore. Smith also went beyond Trump s misogyny and called the business mogul out for his bigoted rhetoric toward basically all minorities: I think as much as we want to believe that love is the greatest human motivator, it s not. Fear is. Fear is the most dangerous and powerful motivator because when a human being gets scared, fight or flight kicks in. And there is this really separatist non-inclusive xenophobic, racist wave that is sweeping the globe that is making us pull apart farther than putting us together.The importance of leaders is that they have to be level headed, they have to be calm, because when people get scared, they lose their morality and that reptile mind takes over. It s the type of thing that you see in all forms of nature, but our leaders can t be that. For Smith, the only comfort he has in the midst of Trump s hateful campaign is his belief in America to know better than to elect the former reality TV star. Once again shaming Trump for his remarks about women, Smith said: For me, deep down in my heart, I believe that America won t and we can t (elect Mr. Trump). Of all the things he has said, and we could go through the laundry list, that was the one that was such an absolute illustration of a darkness of his soul. I just cannot figure out how people can clap for that. He added: I have faith in America. America has had really critical times but the good (people) tend to make their way to the top.

 Judge Rules Man Who Called 911 On John Crawford Can Be Charged (VIDEO),"An Ohio judge ruled that Ronald Ritchie, the man whose 911 call led to the officer-involved shooting of a Black man in an Ohio Walmart store in 2014, can be charged with making a false alarm.In August 2014, 22-year-old John Crawford was shot at least ten times by police, as he shopped for an air gun inside a Beavercreek, Ohio Walmart.Police arrived at the store in response to calls placed by Ronald Ritchie and his wife.During his 911 call, Ritchie claimed that John Crawford had a gun and that he was using it to threaten people.Video evidence showed that John Crawford had picked up the air gun in another part of the store, likely to purchase it.While Ritchie told the 911 operator that John Crawford was pointing the gun at customers, and at one point stated he was aiming it at children, after reviewing the video the judge determined Ritchie s statements were not true.As the AP reports here, the judge specifically noted in her statement: at the time that Ronald Ritchie is relaying to dispatch that Mr. Crawford is pointing the gun at two children, the video does not depict this event. As Addicting reported in August 2014, questions about Ronald and April Ritchie s 911 calls arose almost immediately after the 911 recordings were were released to the public.Ritchie was interviewed immediately following the death of John Crawford. Watch the video from WHIO.Less than 30 days after he told the 911 operator that John Crawford was threatening people inside the store with a gun, he retracted those statements, telling reporters  at no point did he shoulder the rifle and point it at somebody. Contrary to Ritchie s statements, video footage shows that Crawford was using the air gun to prop himself up, leaning on it as he did his shopping. He was talking with his girlfriend on the phone when a group of white officers shouted at him to drop the gun, then immediately opened fire, shooting him multiple times in the back.His last words were  It s not real. The judge ruled that Ritchie cannot be charged with inciting violence, including panic, involuntary manslaughter or reckless homicide, all charges that the court was asked to consider.Ritchie can face charges of making a false alarm, however   a crime for which he could serve six months in jail and pay fines of up to $1000.

House of Representatives to try again to seek Iran deal clampdown,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives plans to reconsider legislation to restrict President Barack Obamas ability to lift sanctions on Iran under an international nuclear deal after its passage was canceled on Wednesday when too few members voted. Obama, a Democrat, has promised to veto the measure, saying it would kill the landmark agreement. No Republicans in Congress supported the accord after it was announced in July.  The Houses Republican leaders decided to vote again later this month in the hope of attracting more support. The measure passed by 191 to 106, almost entirely along party lines, with almost every yes vote coming from Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it. Nearly a third of the House, 137 members, did not vote, and House officials said the chamber would consider it again during the week of Jan. 25. New House speaker Paul Ryan has been trying to keep votes closer to their allotted times rather than hold them open for members who take too long to come to the chamber. The Iran vote was cut off promptly at 15 minutes.  The vote came hours after Iran released 10 U.S. sailors it had held overnight, bringing a swift end to an incident that had rattled nerves days before the expected implementation of the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers. Supporters said the seizure of the sailors was one reason to support the bill. Many U.S. lawmakers have clamored for tougher action against Iran after it tested ballistic missiles late last year and for its refusal to release American prisoners. Iran has been on a bit of a tear, said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as he sought support for the bill. If Iran behaves this way now, in a few days when it gets its hands on this bankroll ... what other actions are we going to see from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards? Royce asked. Iran will receive millions of dollars held up under the sanctions regime after the nuclear pact is implemented. Democrats, including some who opposed the nuclear agreement, likened the bill to the Republican-led Houses more than 60 votes to repeal Obamas healthcare law. We should go back to the drawing board rather than ramming through a partisan measure that will never become law, said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, who opposed the nuclear pact. The White House said on Monday Obama would veto the Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act, saying it would prevent the United States from implementing the Iran deal by tying Obamas ability to lift sanctions to non-nuclear issues.

 Democrats In Four States Are Now SUING Trump For Voter Intimidation,"Democratic party leaders from four states have officially filed federal lawsuits against Donald Trump and his advisor Roger Stone, as well as the state Republican parties for conspiring to threaten, intimidate, and thereby prevent minority voters in urban neighborhoods from voting in the 2016 election. The lawsuits, which have been filed in Arizona, Nevada, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, were spearheaded by Marc Elias, who is the general counsel for Hillary Clinton s campaign. The suits request a federal judge to step in and prevent the defendants from activities such as monitoring polls and verbally harassing voters.The suit against Trump, Stone, and the Nevada Republican Party, which was filed by the Nevada Democratic Party, quotes an unnamed Trump official who said, [w]e have three major voter suppression operations under way.  This, says the suit, is proof of their intentions.The complaint also says: Trump s supporters have responded with pledges to descend upon polling places in  certain areas  where many minority voters live in order to interfere with their efforts to exercise the franchise Immediate relief is necessary. There are only 8 days left until Election Day, and early in-person voting in Nevada is well underway. Trump s calls for unlawful intimidation have grown louder and louder, and the conspiracy to harass and threaten voters on Election Day has already resulted in numerous acts that threaten to interfere with the voting rights of registered Nevada voters. Stop the Steal, a super PAC formed by Stone, is also named in the suit. According to the lawsuits, Stone has a history of engaging in voter intimidation, racist and misogynist hate speech, and incitement to violence. The complaint further states that Trump has repeatedly spread  misinformation  about voter fraud by claiming that the election is rigged against him. An example of this is October 20 when Trump told a crowd gathered at a rally in Delaware, Ohio that Clinton is  truly capable of anything, including voter fraud. The lawsuit also states that Trump, Stone, and the local Republican parties have blatantly violated both the Voting Rights Act and the Klu Klux Klan Act.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",0.0
CHARLIE DANIELS WARNS LIBERALS: Knock It Off Or There Will Be Blood In The Streets!,"Over a century ago, the United States of America went through a divisive and bloody Civil War that separated the people of this nation bone from marrow. It split friends, families and eventually the nation itself as a line was drawn dividing the Union States of the North from the newly formed Confederacy of the Southern States.Ostensibly, the war that followed was fought over the abolition of slavery, a devilish practice that never should have been allowed in the first place, and although it was the basic issue for the conflict   as is the case so much of the time   there were a myriad of other issues involved.One   in my opinion   was just plain stubbornness and pride and the dogged determination that the South would not let itself be told what to do by the other half of the country, but trade, tariffs and different attitudes and beliefs about just how far a federal government could go in setting the tone and making laws to be obeyed by all the states were also involved.The point I m trying to make is that the feelings festered so long and ran so deep that men whose fathers had stood shoulder to shoulder in the war for independence faced off across fields of battle and killed each other.The Civil War never should have happened, and had cooler heads prevailed on both sides, never would have. Southerners had to know that slavery was an abomination to the principles they had fought and died for in the Revolution.No man has the right to own another man, to reap the fruits of his labor for nothing, to consider his children nothing more than commodities to be sold off or traded away on a whim, separating families and breeding human beings like livestock.But instead of acknowledging the very obvious evil of this situation, politicians from the South, convinced that the economy of the Southern States was dependent on slavery, chose to become a separate nation and soon after over six hundred thousand Americans lost their lives in a senseless war that would set the Southern States back a half century.Surely, had it been approached by fair, level-headed men on both sides of the issue, abolition could have been achieved without war. But the rhetoric grew ever hotter. Brash young men on both sides, who had never fired a gun in anger, viewed a war as the pinnacle of romanticism, and implacable politicians refused to give an inch. Is this not the same attitude we see on the streets of America today?I see young people interviewed on television who can t even articulate the reason they are protesting. Others bent on destruction who probably espouse no cause but chaos.I ve seen hysterical protestors screaming about First Amendment rights which they seem to think only protect them and those who think like them and that the opposition has no First Amendment protection and should be shouted down at all costs.The rhetoric is becoming hotter and more nonsensical, the radical element more apparent, the violence and destruction of property more common place.The pot is boiling and it s only a matter of time before there will be blood on the streets.Americans have the right to civil disobedience, a right to gather and demonstrate against some policy they feel is unfair or harmful to the country at large, but they do not have the right to interrupt commerce, break windows, burn cars or do bodily harm to those who disagree with them.People who won t listen to reason, who ignore the law of the land and who try to stifle the opinions of others tend to forget that there is an element of violence on the other side as well, a side that, thankfully, so far has not yet come forth.But, should these conditions continue, someday soon the violent elements of both persuasions will find themselves on the same streets, and what will ensue will not be pretty.Learn from history, or repeat it.What do you think?Pray for our troops, our police and the peace of Jerusalem.God Bless America  Charlie DanielsCharlie Daniels is a legendary American singer, song writer, guitarist, and fiddler famous for his contributions to country and southern rock music.

"Special counsel asks White House to save Trump Jr., Russian meeting documents","WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The special counsel investigating possible collusion between President Donald Trumps 2016 campaign and Russia has asked White House officials to preserve any records of a meeting last year between the presidents eldest son and a Russian lawyer, according to a source with knowledge of the request. Special counsel Robert Mueller sent a document preservation request to the White House, saying the June 2016 meeting that Donald Trump Jr. had at Trump Tower in New York is relevant to his investigation, the source said on Friday. The White House counsels office relayed the request, a routine part of the early phase of any investigation, to other members of the White House staff on Wednesday, the source said. News earlier this month of the meeting between Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer whom he was told had damaging information about his fathers presidential rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, fueled questions about the campaigns dealings with Moscow. The Republican president has defended his sons meeting as simple politics. Trumps son-in-law and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort also attended the meeting. The Senate Judiciary Committee has called for Trump Jr. and Manafort to testify next Wednesday at a public hearing in its Russia probe. The committee said in a statement late Friday that Trump Jr. and Manafort had agreed to negotiate with the panel over whether they will be interviewed by committee members and over documents it is seeking. The committee said it had not issued subpoenas for them to appear at Wednesdays hearing but reserved the right to do so. The House of Representatives Intelligence Committee said it would interview Kushner on Tuesday. Mueller, appointed by the Justice Department in May, is probing allegations of Russian interference in the election and potential collusion by Trumps campaign, an issue that has engulfed the six-month-old administration. Trump has long expressed frustration with a probe that he has called a political witch hunt, and he has denied any collusion. Moscow has denied it interfered in the election campaign to try to tilt the November 2016 vote in Trumps favor. Document requests of the type sent by Mueller generally cover emails, text messages, voicemails, notes or records. The counsel is looking for any indication that the president knew the meeting his son had was planned and might have suggested topics for discussion, the source said. Mueller would also be inquiring into whether Trump was briefed on the meeting afterward, as well as what was discussed, the source said. Mueller would be interested, the source said, in topics such as any discussion of U.S. economic sanctions on Russia, possible Russian investments in the United States or elsewhere, or a possible lifting of a Russian ban on Americans adopting Russian children. Russia imposed the adoption ban to retaliate for the 2012 Magnitsky Act, which imposed sanctions on Russian individuals to punish Russia for human rights violations. Russias ambassador to Washington was overheard by U.S. spy agencies telling his bosses that he had discussed campaign-related matters with Trump adviser Jeff Sessions last year, the Washington Post reported on Friday, citing current and former U.S. officials. Sessions, who was a U.S. senator at the time and is now the attorney general, initially failed to disclose the contacts with Ambassador Sergei Kislyak and then said they were not about the campaign. Under pressure over having not disclosed the meetings with Kislyak, Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe in March. The recusal angered Trump, who said in a New York Times interview this week that he would not have chosen Sessions for attorney general if he had known Sessions would recuse himself. [nL1N1KB0UN] Newspaper reports said Trumps lawyers are reviewing ways to limit or undermine the special counsel.  The Washington Post and The New York Times on Thursday cited unidentified people familiar with the strategy. A Trump attorney contacted by Reuters, John Dowd, denied the reports and praised Mueller. We think hes a straight, honest guy, Dowd said. Dowd said communications with Mueller were productive and we have confidence hes going to do the right thing. Another Trump lawyer, Jay Sekulow, told the Times that addressing possible conflicts of interest in Muellers team would be appropriate but declined to comment on specifics. Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway referred on Friday to reports that members of Muellers team have made donations to the Democratic Party. People should know what folks paths and motivations and political motivations are, she said in a Fox News interview. According to the Post, Trump has asked his advisers about his power to pardon aides, family members and even himself in connection with the Russia probe. Trumps lawyers have been discussing the presidents pardoning powers, a second person told the newspaper. Dowd dismissed the pardon report as nonsense. Its just not true, he said. Separately, the spokesman for Trumps legal team, Mark Corallo, confirmed his resignation on Friday. And lead attorney Marc Kasowitz will take on a reduced role on the outside legal team, according to media reports. Other recent changes included the hiring of veteran Washington lawyer Ty Cobb to a White House job to handle responses to the Russia probe. [nL1N1K60C4] ",1.0
 Late Night Hosts Out Of New York City Utterly CRUCIFY Ted Cruz For Being There (VIDEO),"When you go after a city that s home to most of the late night shows that air on television, guess what, you re going to get roasted. Which is exactly what just happened to Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz when he arrived in New York City after his  New York values  comments.In a video montage pieced together by Politico, they show host after host going after Cruz, and even Trump, with some jokes that clearly show their disdain for the Texas senator and real estate mogul/reality television star.You ll see Conan O Brien first, and yes, he broadcasts out of Los Angeles now, but was long a New York resident when his show was out of the city. Then you ll see Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon, Late Show host Stephen Colbert, Late Night host Seth Meyers, and of course Trevor Noah from The Daily Show.One of the best digs at Cruz came from Seth Meyers when he said: Hillary rode the subway with a group of reporters and her Secret Service detail, then after the train was gone, Ted Cruz scurried across the tracks and disappeared into a hole. And he s absolutely correct, not only is Cruz a rat, is a disingenuous one at that.The gloves came off, and rightfully so. It was sincerely a beautiful thing to witness. These Republican candidates are a parody in and of themselves and deserve every ounce of mockery they receive.Watch the video mash-up here from Politico:Featured image via video screen capture",0.0
" MI Gov. Dick Sends SEVEN National Guardsman To Help 100,000 Flint Residents","Earlier this week, as public outrage and media attention focused on his failed response to the Flint water disaster, Michigan s republican governor announced that he was calling in the National Guard to help deal with the escalating crisis.On January 13, those troops arrived in the city of 100,000 people. All SEVEN of them. Yes, seven. As in one less than eight.Doing the math, Snyder s response equates to one guardsman per 14,285.7 people.The city of Flint is experiencing a crisis of epic proportions, thanks entirely to the Snyder administration. Water poisoned with lead, and water that is potentially contaminated with the Legionella bacteria (which has already caused 87 serious illnesses and ten deaths) is just one aspect of what is happening in Flint.After the governor and his appointed emergency managers switched the city s water supply to the Flint River, they decided not to bother to treat it with standard corrosion control measures.According to researchers from Virginia Tech University, Flint is the only city in the U.S. that did not have these measures in place.As Marc Edwards of the Virginia Tech water study described to Michigan Radio back in October: What we discovered to our shock was that they switched to a new water source that was obviously very corrosive, meaning it would eat up the lead pipe and iron pipe and essentially put the metals into the water, without controlling the corrosion. And this is a horrible idea in a city full of lead plumbing and lead pipe like Flint. He went on to describe the standard practice for changing a water source. Before you switch to a new water source, six months to a year ahead of time, you are supposed to do laboratory experiments to determine the corrosivity of the water, and the chemistry   the pH, the alkalinity, and the phosphate that you need to make sure that the lead stays on the pipes and out of the water. Edwards explains that Flint s new water system had to have a  corrosion control  plan in place, otherwise the result is that you re  doing an uncontrolled human experiment on a city s population. The decision by Rick Snyder s emergency manager to just skip what was apparently viewed as an  unnecessary  corrosion control expense has basically been just that.  An uncontrolled experiment on a city s population. The amount of damage done to the city s infrastructure is just beginning to be realized.This photo from Flint Water Study researchers Ni Zhu and Siddhartha Roy shows the magnitude of the situtuation.Image credit: Flint Water StudyAccording to a new report released today, researchers believe that the damaged and corroded pipes that are transmitting water throughout the city are likely to become a breeding ground for bacteria, such as the Legionella bacteria which causes Legionaire s disease, along with a host of other potential pathogens.Because of the nature of the Legionella bacteria, which is transmitted through tiny droplets of water in the air, Virginia Tech researchers are recommending that vulnerable populations have minimal contact with the water. That includes people who smoke, the elderly, people with diabetes, people who have recently had surgery and others who might be at greater risk of contracting a waterborne respiratory disease.About 100,000 Flint residents are affected by this unmitigated disaster.In response, Governor Snyder put on a big show of  sending in the National Guard.  Now we know that only SEVEN guardsmen were actually dispatched to the city.After being forced to respond to questions regarding the number of guardsmen he sent to the city, the governor s office proclaimed that there could be as many as 30 or 40 National Guardsmen sent to Flint by the end of the week.During his PR conference on Tuesday, Snyder told the people of Michigan  As we work to ensure that all Flint residents have access to clean and safe drinking water, we are providing them with the direct assistance they need in order to stretch our resources further. The Michigan National Guard is trained and ready to assist the citizens of Flint. He neglected to mention that he was sending SEVEN guardsmen.As reported by Fox 2: The Governor s rhetoric is not doing much to quiet the growing fury in Flint. Gov. Rick Snyder called in the National Guard to assist those helping to get bottled water and filters to the people of Flint. Just seven members of the National Guard showed up to help the nearly 100,000 people in Flint. Watch this video on Governor Snyder s pathetic response to the Flint water disaster, via Fox 2.

Chronology: Europe's long road in search of a common defense,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - France, Germany and 21 other EU governments signed a defense pact on Monday they hope marks a new era of greater European military integration after Britain s decision to quit the bloc. Below is a list of dates in European defense cooperation: 1949 - The United States, Canada and European countries set up the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a U.S.-led military alliance. 1950 - The European Defence Community is proposed as a European alternative to NATO to incorporate West Germany and create a European army, a joint budget and shared arms.  1954 - The French parliament rejects the European Army plan. Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Britain form the Western European Union, a common defense group with a shared air force and joint command. 1993 - The EU s Maastricht Treaty redefines European integration and introduces a Common Foreign and Security Policy as one of its goals, allowing European governments to take joint action in foreign policy. 1998 - Britain and France agree to common defense in the Saint-Malo Declaration, and London pledges to play a central role in the security and defense policy of the European Union. 2003 - The European Union launches its first independent military mission outside of Europe, Operation Artemis, with United Nations backing, to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 2004 - The European Defence Agency is formed to help EU governments develop their military capabilities. 2007 - Rapid-reaction forces of about 1,500 soldiers, called EU Battlegroups, are formed under control of the Council of the European Union.

California lawmakers consider spending billions to fix housing,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Affordable housing advocates are closely watching a package of bills currently under consideration by California lawmakers that would invest billions of dollars in helping to alleviate the states severe housing crisis. For years, California residents have struggled to afford surging real estate and rental prices in many of the countrys most expensive housing markets. Nearly one-third of California renters pay more than 50 percent of their income toward rent. If passed, the bills would create a permanent $300 million-a-year fund for affordable housing, streamline the approval process for housing construction in cities and authorize a $3 billion bond for the 2018 ballot, the first housing bond in California for over a decade. The states Senate has approved the package, but the Assembly, which is expected to vote next week, has shown more reticence over costs. Lawmakers worked closely with Democratic Governor Jerry Brown, who in July announced his support for a general obligation bond, a permanent funding source for affordable housing and regulatory reform.  This comprehensive approach does whats long been needed in California, Brown said in July. Astronomical housing costs are straining family budgets and stressing employees who cant afford to live where they work. Thats unacceptable. On Thursday, California Treasurer John Chiang urged state lawmakers to quickly pass the package as well as to increase the general obligation bond to between $6 billion and $9 billion to kick-start construction. We have the opportunity now to move decisively toease a 1.5 million-unit shortfall in affordablehousing. Butwe must think big and act boldly, Chiang in a statement. Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Len and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon have also expressed support for a housing deal. Homeownership rates in California are at their lowest since the 1940s and the lack of supply is seen as a major contributor to the problem. Production of new homes across the state averaged less than 80,000 annually over the last decade, far below the projected need of 180,000 additional homes annually, according to the California Department of Housing and Community Development.

Trump campaign star Conway named as his presidential counselor,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Kellyanne Conway, a Republican pollster who was widely credited with bringing a more disciplined approach to Donald Trumps presidential election campaign, will become White House counselor when he takes office next month. In her new post, Conway will play a key advisory role, helping to manage Trumps messaging and legislative priorities, the transition team said in a statement on Thursday. It praised Conway, 49, as the first woman campaign manager to guide a winning U.S. presidential campaign. Trump also tapped three loyalists to lead his communications team. The Republican National Committees Sean Spicer will be press secretary, while Hope Hicks, Jason Miller and Dan Scavino will round out the communications team. Both before the Nov. 8 election and after, Conway, as a senior adviser on the transition team, has been a frequent presence on U.S. television news programs, often called upon to defend or explain Trumps thinking. Conway played a crucial role in my victory, Trump said in the transition team statement. She is a tireless and tenacious advocate of my agenda and has amazing insights on how to effectively communicate our message.  Trump, a New York businessman, takes office on Jan. 20. Conway, interviewed by ABCs Good Morning America shortly after the announcement, was asked when Trump would hold his first news conference. She avoided directly answering the question. Trump has held several rallies since winning the election but has not taken formal questions from reporters.  He canceled a Dec. 15 news conference to discuss how he would handle his vast business interests once in the White House and said he would reschedule that for January. Conway told ABC that Trump was focusing on forming his Cabinet. Hes been very busy doing that, she said. Because of her prominent role in the campaign and transition team, there had been considerable speculation over what post Conway, a veteran political strategist, might occupy in Trumps administration. Conway, who has four children, said she did not immediately accept a position offered to her early on in the transition period because she had to weigh her family obligations. I would say that I dont play golf and I dont have a mistress so, I have a lot of time that a lot of these other men dont, Conway told Fox Business Network. I see people on the weekend spending an awful lot of time on their golf games and thats their right, but the kids will be with me, we live in the same house, and they come first. ",1.0
THE OBAMA BOUNCE: UKIP Leader Claims Obamas Insulting Threat To UK Voters BACKFIREDActually Drove Voters To Support Leave EU Movement,"Barack Hussein Obama has been in over his head since he first stepped foot in the White House. Our Community Organizer In Chief just found out how unwelcome his Chicago style politics are in the UK   UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader Nigel Farage told Breitbart that the visit by President Obama, where he threatened to send Britain to the  back of the queue  if the public voted to leave the European Union (EU), backfired and caused a  Brexit Bounce , swaying Britons to vote for Brexit.Comparing the outcome to the American Independence Day, Mr. Farage said: You [Americans] have your Independence Day where in July you celebrate being your own country, governing yourself, having your own courts, controlling your own borders and that s what happened to us yesterday. We have broken away from a political union where our power was being overruled, our courts were being overruled, and we had a complete open border for anybody from southern and eastern Europe, so this is a major historic step. On the EU post-Brexit, he said: We ve not just changed British history. I m sure that the EU project itself will now come tumbling down. I would like to think and hope that right across the globe what we ve done is to prove that people power can beat the establishment. The European Union project has failed. It is dying before your very eyes. It is unwanted, it is unloved, and people across the country are saying what UKIP has been saying for years:  We want our country back, we want our democracy back, we want the closest possible relationship with our neighbours. We re happy to have a NAFTA kind of agreement with free trade, but we don t want political union . Asked of any lessons drawn from his own experiences that could be applied during the American presidential elections, Mr. Farage advised: Threatening people insults their intelligence. Don t threaten people repeatedly because if you do in the end they think you re crying wolf and they won t believe you. It s Project Fear, or in the end when Obama came it was Project Threat.Citing Mr. Obama s visit to the UK at the request of Prime Minister David Cameron:The lessons learnt from the Obama visit are fascinating. Here is the most powerful man in the world coming from a country that we have always had huge regard for. And people in Britain listening to Obama said:  how dare the American president come here and tell us what to do  and it backfired.And I think we got an Obama Brexit Bounce, because people do not want to be told how to think and how to vote.  BreitbartWatch here to see how citizens reacted to Obama s threat:https://youtu.be/w-DSGtfWgegRepublican lawmakers warned US President Barack Obama his controversial intervention into the British EU referendum debate threatens to harm the  special relationship. During a visit timed to coincide with Queen Elizabeth II s 90th birthday earlier this year, Obama warned that the United States would be in no hurry to agree a bilateral trade deal with a Britain outside the EU. I think it s fair to say that maybe at some point down the line there might be a UK-US trade agreement, but it s not going to happen any time soon because our focus is in negotiating with a big bloc, the European Union, to get a trade agreement done. And the UK is going to be at the back of the queue,  he said.Obama s comments caused furore among Leave campaigners, with UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader Nigel Farage accusing Obama of  talking Britain down. Former Defense Minister Liam Fox dismissed the president s intervention, calling his views  largely irrelevant,  as he will soon be leaving the White House. Via: RT",0.0

Jordan begins diplomatic offensive ahead of Trump move on Jerusalem,"AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan has begun consultations on convening an emergency meeting of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation before an expected move this week by U.S. President Donald Trump to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, a senior Jordanian source said.   A senior U.S. administration official said on Friday that Trump was likely to make the controversial declaration in a speech on Wednesday. Recognizing Jerusalem would upend decades of American policy and possibly inflame tensions in the Middle East. Jordan, the current president of the Arab summit, would invite members of the two bodies to convene if the recognition is extended, to  discuss ways of dealing with the consequences of such a decision that raised alarm and concern , the senior Jordanian diplomatic source told Reuters.  It could ultimately hamper all efforts to get the peace process moving and would certainly be provocative to Arab and Muslim countries and Muslim communities across the West,  said the source, asking not to be named.  No issue can move Arabs and Muslims in the same potent way as Jerusalem does.       King Abdullah s Hashemite dynasty is the custodian of the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, making Amman sensitive to any changes of status of the disputed city. Officials are worried the move could trigger violence in the Palestinian territories and a spillover into Jordan, a country where many people are descendants of Palestinian refugees whose families left after the creation of Israel in 1948.  A tremendous wave of anger will spread across the Arab and Muslim world,  said another regional diplomatic source in touch with U.S. officials on the issue. Tensions in Jerusalem s Al Aqsa compound, the third holiest site in Islam, earlier this year provoked days of unrest.  Word of Trump s planned announcement, which would deviate from the line taken by previous U.S. presidents who insisted Jerusalem s status must be decided in negotiations, drew criticism from the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, and the international community does not recognize Israel s claim on all of the city, home to sites holy to the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions.     Jordan lost East Jerusalem and the West Bank to Israel during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and says the city s fate should only be decided only at the end of a final settlement.   King Abdullah warned of the repercussions of Trump s expected move in talks this week in Washington with top administration officials.  Trump suggested earlier this year he was open to new ways to achieve Middle East peace that did not necessarily entail the creation of a Palestinian state, a hallmark of U.S. policy for decades.  If it happens (recognition of Jerusalem) it will jeopardize all efforts towards stability and peace in the region and thwart a resolution of the conflict,  the regional diplomatic source said.  ",1.0

 WATCH: Joy Reid Points Out That Trump Doesnt Have The Balls To Bully His Targets In Person,"Ever notice that Donald Trump is more than willing to attack people when they aren t around, but cowardly tucks his tail between his legs when he is face-to-face with them? Joy Reid certainly noticed.During an appearance on the Rachel Maddow Show on Thursday night, Reid pointed out that although Republican nominee Donald Trump brags about being tough when he is bullying people, he acts like a total coward when the people he is trying to bully are in the same room with him.To make her case, Reid brought up the fact that despite Trump declaring that Mexico will pay for his ridiculous wall he was timid during his meeting with the Mexican president. The bully instantly became the coward and it became clear that Trump only pretends to be tough in front of his own supporters.The fact that Trump resumed his pretended toughness and bullying towards Mexico only when he returned to the United States to deliver a speech in Arizona is proof that Trump is all talk and no walk.Furthermore, even though he trashed the black Flint pastor who shut him down during a speech that was becoming too political, he only did it on Fox News. He didn t dare challenge the pastor to her face in front of a crowd of a African-Americans. Once again, the bully shrunk into the coward he is. Donald Trump the blusterer is not the same guy when he is in front of the audience he is insulting when he is in front of the Mexican president,  Reid said.  When he is confronted by anyone, when he is confronted, he backs down and then turns around and tells a story about how tough he was. The more he puts himself in front of audiences of color, the more he shows off he is passive and aggressive. He is only aggressive when he is not in the presence of the person he is bullying. When he gets in front of the person that he previously insulted, he becomes incredibly passive. Here s the video via VidMe.Now that it s established that Trump is a coward, it ll be fun to watch how he reacts when it comes time to debate Hillary Clinton face-to-face. Because he has been bullying her the most.Featured image via screen capture",0.0

Ukrainian lawmaker blames Russia for deadly Kiev blast,"KIEV (Reuters) - A Ukrainian lawmaker wounded in an explosion in Kiev that killed two people blamed Russia on Thursday for the blast while investigators said they were considering various motives for what they called an act of terrorism. Ihor Mosiychuk, a member of the populist opposition Radical Party, was hospitalized but did not suffer life-threatening injuries, while his bodyguard and a passerby were killed. Two others were wounded. Since fighting with pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine broke out in 2014, the number of incidents involving explosives outside the conflict zone has increased. There has been a spate of vehicle bombings over the past 18 months in Kiev, the capital, and elsewhere, but investigators have failed to find those responsible.  Ukraine s state security service (SBU) said that unknown perpetrators had rigged a motorcycle with explosives on Wednesday that detonated as the lawmaker left a TV station. Radical party leader Oleg Lyashko said he had no doubt the incident was politically motivated, while Mosiychuk blamed Russia.  I believe that the initiators are in Moscow, the executors are in Kiev,  Mosiychuk said on Facebook. Russian involvement is one of the possible motives being investigated, deputy Kiev prosecutor Pavlo Kononenko told journalists.  Another explanation is Mosiychuk s political activity, his public position within our country,  he said.  A third explanation is an attempt on Mosiychuk s life for personal reasons.  The Kremlin dismissed the accusations as a product of anti-Russian sentiment.  Beyond all doubt, these are new signs of this anti-Russian campaign which has unfortunately swept across Ukraine and Kiev,  Russian President Vladimir Putin s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. Relations between Kiev and Moscow collapsed in 2014 after Russia seized Ukraine s Crimea peninsula and backed a pro-Russian separatist insurgency in eastern Ukrainian regions.      Radical Party lawmaker Evhen Deidei posted photos on his Facebook page from the scene of Wednesday s attack which showed the burnt-out shell of a motorcycle in front of a damaged vehicle.   Judging by the damage to the car and the shrapnel holes in the doors, the power of the explosion was pretty strong,  he said.  There is a lot of blood on the stairs, where Ihor was situated at the time of the explosion.  The interior ministry s Shkiryak said political analyst Vitaliy Bala was one of the three wounded in the blast. In June, a colonel in Ukraine s military intelligence was killed by a car bomb in central Kiev. In 2016 a prominent investigative journalist, Pavel Sheremet, was killed by an explosive device in his car.   ",1.0
BUSTED! ABC/WASHINGTON POST POLL Showing Hillary Clinton Leading Trump By +12 Is FAKE,"Those who were  shocked  by the latest ABC / Washington Post goal seeking report (aka  poll ) that shows Hillary opening up a 12-point lead with likely voters after the latest debate last Wednesday need to look a little further. Ironically, this  poll  farce was  embargoed for release after 9 a.m.  EST on Saturday, which made it a dominant topic of conversation on all the morning talk shows.Of course, like many of the recent polls from the likes of Reuters, ABC and The Washington Post, something curious emerges when you look just beneath the surface of the headline 12-point lead.Meanwhile, with huge variances in preference across demographics one can easily see how simple it is to  rig  a poll by over indexing to one group vs. another. While the pollsters release the the split of the sample pool by political affiliation, they do not share the split by any of the following demographics which are just as important to determining the outcome of the poll.  Zero Hedge METHODOLOGY   This ABC News poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone Oct. 20-22, 2016, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 874 likely voters. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 36-27-31 percent, Democrats   Republicans   Independents. As we ve pointed out numerous times in the past, in response to Reuters  efforts to  tweak  their polls, per the The Pew Research Center, at least since 1992, democrats have never enjoyed a 9-point registration gap despite the folks at ABC and The Washington Post somehow convincing themselves it was a reasonable margin.Rush Limbaugh weighed in on the suspicious outlier poll that came out on Saturday night: I don t care what network you watch, maybe with Fox exempted, although certain places at Fox you ll find the same sentiment. It s over. And they all cite these polls. They all cite the polls that show Hillary up 10 to 12 points. And even take the low point at 10, I just saw somebody on CNN, a conservative Republican say,  At 10 points with two weeks it s over, there s no way you can reverse that, it s history. So they all believe the polls. In fact, their belief in the polls is biblical. I think these people have a greater confidence and faith in the polls than they do in the Bible. So it s over. And, furthermore, to show you just how over it is, the Democrats are actually now in red states where Trump may win those states, but they re in there and they re working down the ballot and they re gonna win back the House, they re gonna win back the Senate, and Chuck-U Schumer is gonna end up a majority leader in the Senate.And you Republicans, you are toast, do you understand? You Republicans, it s toast, and you Republicans had better start doing your postmortems right now, and you had better starting figuring out why this happened. You lost this because you saw to it that Trump was nominated, and if you weren t for Trump, you better find out who made it possible for Trump to be nominated, and you better do something about those people. Americans who are sick and tired of a corrupt media and the corrupt politicians they prop up, need to ignore these manufactured polls. Instead of wasting time reading this drivel, Americans need to be out knocking on doors and contacting friends, to explain to them why we need a President like Trump to DRAIN THE SWAMP!There has never been a better time to ignore Hillary s media and stay focused on the prize ",0.0
Maltese journalist's son says she was murdered for exposing corruption,"VALLETTA (Reuters) - The son of Malta s best-known investigative journalist said on Tuesday his mother had been killed by a car bomb because of her work exposing political corruption, as hundreds of people demonstrated to demand justice after her death. Daphne Caruana Galizia, who wrote about graft across Malta s political divides on her blog, died when explosives ripped through her car minutes after she left her home in the north of the island on Monday afternoon. Maltese authorities were waiting for the arrival of Dutch forensic experts and American FBI agents to help the investigations.  My mother was assassinated because she stood between the rule of law and those who sought to violate it, like many strong journalists,  Matthew Caruana Galizia said on Facebook.  She was also targeted because she was the only person doing so,  he added. He described rushing to the scene, only to find the burning car and her remains. Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, who was accused of wrong-doing by Caruana Galizia earlier this year and had been suing her over some of her allegations, denounced her killing and pledged to track down those responsible. But a small group booed Muscat on Tuesday evening when he left his office, and the opposition is calling for him to resign.  The prime minister and his government have been responsible for diminishing the rule of law in Malta,  opposition leader Adrian Delia told Reuters.  They have created an environment where people are afraid to speak out.  On Tuesday afternoon, several hundred people demonstrated in front of the law courts demanding justice for Caruana Galizia s killers.  The state did not defend Daphne,  shouted Andrew Borg Cardona, addressing the crowd. He said those who accused her of  going over the top  with her investigations  are all guilty . One woman carried a votive lamp with the murdered journalist s picture in it and another carried a sign that read  Looks like we can t have freedom of speech but we want justice . Recently, Caruana Galizia had been following up leads from information in the so-called Panama Papers, a large collection of documents from an offshore law firm in the Central American nation that were leaked in 2015. She was tracing alleged links between Maltese officials and offshore banks and companies used as tax havens. Half an hour before the explosion, Caruana Galizia wrote on her blog:  There are crooks everywhere you look now. The situation is desperate.  The European Commission told journalists it was horrified by the murder in the bloc s smallest state and called for justice. Spokesman Margaritis Schinas was asked if the Commission would open a procedure to check if Malta was meeting the EU s standards for the rule of law, a process now being applied to Poland over judicial reforms there. He replied:  We never speculate on these questions. These are very serious subjects ... This is an outrageous act that happened, and what matters now is that justice will be brought.   This is what we need to see.  The killing near the village of Bidnija stunned the Mediterranean island. Authorities said it was the first murder of a journalist there.  I saw a small explosion coming from the car and I panicked. A few seconds later, around three to four seconds, there was another, larger explosion,  said resident Frans Sant, who was driving in the other direction.  The car continued coming down the hill, skidding at high speed, full of fire. The car missed me by around 10 feet. I tried to help, but the fire was too much and the car ended up in the field,  he told Reuters Television. ",1.0
Trump business policy forum says disbanding due to 'distraction',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps Strategic and Policy Forum is disbanding because debate over member participation has become a distraction from its goals of aiding policy discussions, the business advisory group said in a statement on Wednesday. As such, the President and we are disbanding the Forum, the group said. Intolerance, racism and violence have absolutely no place in this country and are an affront to core American values, it said, after corporate CEOs quit two Trump  business advisory councils in protest at his remarks blaming violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, not only on white nationalists but also on the protesters who opposed them.

 This Is Why Obama Is Already Winning The War To Replace Scalia,"The kneejerk response of Republicans to the death of Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia was a blanket statement refusing even a basic hearing for a replacement candidate submitted by President Obama, despite his Constitutional duty to do so.Now, only a few days later there are signs that the right s solidarity is turning to Jell-O before the eyes of the world.A series of statements from senior Republicans contradicted their own previously expressed views and seemed to question whether rank-and-file Republicans were completely on board with the plan from Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to do nothing on a Supreme Court nominee this year and let the next president make the nomination.Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) told Iowa radio reporters that he had not determined whether to have hearings before the Judiciary Committee, which he chairs.  I would wait until the nominee is made before I would make any decision,  Grassley, the committee chairman, said.To add insult to injury, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC), told a conservative radio host that  we fall into the trap if we just simply say  Sight unseen,  we fall into the trap of being obstructionist. President Obama amped up the pressure in his press conference on Tuesday, noting that he would be proceeding with a nominee and that the Senate had ample time to consider his submission and give him or her a fair up or down vote in front of the full Senate.As the conservative ranks get worn down, the left has expressed solidarity despite the testy primary between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Both candidates have made public remarks indicating that it is President Obama s right to make a nomination, and for that candidate to get a vote.Conservatives who insist on continued obstruction of a vacant Supreme Court seat will have to prepare themselves for at least nine months of public pressure asking why they refuse to fully staff America s highest court   or as seems to already be happening, giving in bit by bit.Featured image via Flickr",0.0
 Everyone KNEW Trump Would Be Golfing Again  So Protesters Were Totally Ready When He Showed Up,"There are only three things for certain in this world: Death, taxes, and Trump golfing every weekend. Today featured all three in a way.Two days ago, Trump spent around $90 million in tax dollars to bomb an empty airbase in Syria. The symbolic attack did little to stop the Syrian government s ability to bomb its citizens   bombers were reportedly back to using the airstrip just hours later   but it had the effect of inflaming already high tensions between the United States and supporters of the Syrian regime in Russia and Iran.So covering death and taxes, Trump moved onto golf.The fact that he would go on vacation just days after creating an international crisis was so painfully obvious that protesters planned for it. When Trump s motorcade was spotted on route to his golf course in Florida, the signs came out to greet him. According to reporters riding with Trump, the stuff Trump saw should put to rest any notion that he isn t aware that much of the country despises him.Pool: Motorcade passed ""group of about a dozen protesters w/ signs reading ""Resign,"" ""Loser,"" and ""Impeach Trump"" outside the golf course.""  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) April 8, 2017It s not clear yet whether Trump plans to lie about his golf outing as he s done in previous weeks. By a rough count, Trump has golfed around 15 times since becoming president 11 weeks ago. Many of those vacations were done in secret, with his staff covering for him with claims that he was in  meetings.  Inevitably, pictures of Trump in golf attire hitting the links turn up online exposing just how shameless this administration is.The fact that protesters can be so certain that Trump will be golfing   even after committing America to a possible war in Syria   is incredibly disheartening. You can plan your day around the assumption that the most powerful person in the country will be slipping into golfing shoes every single weekend. Hilariously, this criticism was most clearly leveled by one of Trump s biggest defenders: Sean Hannity.In 2013, Hannity hypocritically slammed Obama of playing golf during the Syrian civil war.The war in Syria rages on but so far Hannity hasn t complained about any one of Trump s 15 golf outings. Odd. And further undermining Hannity s complaint: Trump has spent so much time golfing that he s now spent a quarter of Obama s total cost in travel expenses in just his first 11 weeks. By the end of his first year, he will have cost the American taxpayer over $100 million.Report: Obama's travel expenses were $97m over eight years. Trump is at $23m in 10 wks https://t.co/7PmdQryBmO  Brandon Pope TV (@BpopeTV) April 8, 2017Featured image via  Ian MacNicol/Getty Images",0.0
European Parliament wants Britain to end discrimination against EU citizens: draft,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European parliamentarians want Britain to end  regrettable  practices that discriminate against EU citizens in the workplace and elsewhere, a draft resolution published on Thursday showed.  Lawmakers also urged British authorities to grant broad rights to EU citizens and their families in Britain after it exits the EU in 2019, an issue where EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Thursday big differences remained. The European Parliament  expresses concern about regrettable administrative practices against EU citizens living in the United Kingdom , the draft resolution said.  Lawmakers said there were also cases of British citizens discriminated against in other EU countries. The British government said on Sept. 9 that its Equalities Office (GEO) was  aware of, and is looking into, reports of discrimination against non-UK EU nationals seeking employment  in violation of the 2010 Equality Act. The document, agreed on Thursday by the leaders of the assembly s political parties, will be voted on by the chamber next week in Strasbourg. The document is not binding on EU negotiators but the 28-nation parliament has the right to veto any deal with Britain on its future relations with the EU. MPs also urged Britain to protect the rights of EU citizens and their children even if they are born there after Brexit.  Future family members should continue to benefit from right of residence under the same provisions as current family members,  the document said. EU lawmakers have opposed Britain s proposals to create a new category of  settled status  under United Kingdom immigration law for EU citizens. Differences on these issues remain, Barnier said on Thursday at the end of a fourth round of Brexit negotiations. Without sufficient progress on citizens  rights, the EU will not move on to negotiations on a future trade deal with London. ",1.0
Trump to nominate Huntsman as Russia ambassador: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will nominate Jon Huntsman, an envoy to China under former Democratic President Barack Obama, as U.S. ambassador to Russia, the White House said on Tuesday. The job, all the more high-profile because of allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate. If confirmed, Huntsman, who has long been expected to be Trumps pick for the job, will head to Moscow as the U.S. Congress and a special counsel investigate Russias role in the 2016 presidential election and allegations that Trumps campaign had ties to Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied the interference, and Trump has said there was no collusion with Moscow. Huntsman, a former Utah governor, was U.S. ambassador to China from 2009 to 2011. He has served in the administrations of five U.S. presidents and was a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. Trump has said he wants to improve relations with Russia. The Republican president met with Putin in Germany at the gathering of G20 leaders there earlier this month and officials said he raised the issue of Russian meddling in the election before moving on to other issues such as the war in Syria. Reports in March that Huntsman would get the Moscow envoy post were greeted with mixed reviews in Moscow, with one politician saying he was not a dove and the Kremlin saying it would welcome anyone who was a convinced proponent of establishing a dialogue with Russia.

SERIOUSLY INJURED Cop Sues Black Lives MatterDoes He Have A Case?,"This group of Black Lives Matter supporters marched at the Minnesota State Fair chanting,  Pigs in a blanket, fry  em like bacon!  The media, and the former President Barack Obama ignored it.Watch:Watch Michael Brown s stepfather encourage BLM rioters to burn down the city of Ferguson, MO:Daily Mail   Black Lives Matter and five of its leaders are being sued by a Baton Rouge cop who blames them for  inciting  Gavin Eugene Long s murderous rampage in the city last summer.The officer has not been named, but his description matches that of East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff s Deputy Nicholas Tullier, 42, who suffered severe brain damage in the attack.Tullier, a father of two, was shot in the head, shoulder and neck, and was left in a vegetative state.He has since returned to consciousness, regained some motor control and can now communicate non-verbally.His attacker, 29-year-old Long, was shot dead by a SWAT team member around ten minutes after the mass shooting began.Long, a black military veteran, shot six officers, killing three and seriously injuring one, on July 17 last year in response to the shooting of unarmed black man Alton Sterling by white cops.The suit, filed on Friday, says that BLM leaders  incited violence  in retaliation for the death of black men killed by police  and its denunciations of the attacks came  all but too late , CBS News reported.Long had left a note before the shooting in which he said he wanted to hurt  bad cops as well as good cops in hopes that the good cops (which are the majority) will be able to stand together and enact justice and punishment against bad cops. He also said in a YouTube video that he was only affiliated with  the spirit of justice. Don t affiliate me with nothing,  he said.  Yeah, I was also a Nation of Islam member, I m not affiliated with it  They ll try to put you with ISIS or some other terrorist group   no. Among the five BLM members named in the suit is DeRay Mckesson, 31, a former school administrator turned civil rights activist.The suit claims that Mckesson, who took part in nightly protests after Sterling s death on July 5, was  in charge of  a march on July 9 that turned into a  riot.

Is North Koreas Kim Jong-un Considering Using 70-Year Old Biplanes to Go Undetected By Modern Radar?,"What will he think of next? Is Kim Jong-un is preparing his special forces for suicide parachute missions across the border on 70-year-old Stalin era biplanes?Footage has emerged of North Korean paratroops jumping from the aged aircraft from very low levels in a show of force.The aircraft, which were designed in 1947, have an incredibly low radar profile   meaning they are difficult to track using conventional radar. They also fly at such a slow speed that modern anti-aircraft systems are programmed to ignore their limited returns.Also, the aircraft can hug the earth meaning ground-based missile systems will not pick them up and supersonic attack jets will find difficulty in detecting them from above. The bottom of the wings and the fuselage of Kim s fleet of aircraft have been painted blue with the top of the wings is green as a form of camouflage to prevent both ground troops and aircraft spotting them. According to The Drive, the aircraft could even land on short sections of road, allowing their troops to disembark and begin a sneak attack. It is feared the old aircraft could even deliver a nuclear bomb   possibly in a suicide attack into a strategically vital location. It is believed North Korea has at least 1,000 artillery pieces within striking range of Seoul, the South Korean capital, which is home to 25 million people. Kim has claimed North Korea now has technology to miniaturise its nuclear weapons to fit onto an ballistic missile. North Korea could potentially load a bomb onto the back of an An-2   with its one-tonne cargo capacity   and detonate it over the south. Read more: Daily Mail ",0.0
"Roadside bombs wound 20, kill soldier in Thailand's troubled south","BANGKOK (Reuters) - Roadside bombs planted by suspected Muslim insurgents in southern Thailand killed one soldier on Thursday and wounded 20 other people, most of them soldiers and police, security forces said. The blasts occurred in Yala, one of the predominantly ethnic, Malay Muslim provinces in the deep south where a separatist insurgency has dragged on for decades, with more than 6,500 people killed since 2004 alone. The first bomb did not result in any casualties, but the other two killed one soldier and wounded 18 soldiers and police and two villagers.   It is believed to be the work of violent groups already creating incidents in the area,  Pramote Prom-in, a spokesman for regional security forces, told Reuters.  As with most violence in Thailand s deep south, there was no claim of responsibility. The insurgents are fighting for secession from mostly Buddhist Thailand. Until they were annexed in 1909, Thailand s three southernmost provinces of Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat were  part of an independent Malay Muslim sultanate. ",1.0
 Trump Begins Day Of Diplomacy By Escalating Hot War With The Press (TWEETS),"Donald Trump is supposed to have several important phone calls with world leaders today, amounting to what is being billed as a  day of diplomacy.  Given Trump s inexperience and impulsive statements, world leaders are especially skeptical of what his being leader of the free world (*SHUDDER*) will really mean for the world. So, one would think that he would spend his morning preparing for his calls, right? WRONG.Instead, Trump is up and tweeting, when he is, as of this writing, set to be on a call with the Prime Minister of Japan at any moment. His target? Why, the press, of course. The Washington Post and the New York Times have been on Trump s hit list for quite some time, and that thorny relationship has gotten worse, since Trump s White House is leaking like a sieve regarding his temperament and inability to do his job as president. It was the Washington Post who said Trump s team is portraying him as a  clueless child,  which of course enraged the thin-skinned sorry excuse for a  president.  To that end, Trump fired off a series of tweets doing his best to discredit those outlets:The failing @nytimes has been wrong about me from the very beginning. Said I would lose the primaries, then the general election. FAKE NEWS!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28, 2017Thr coverage about me in the @nytimes and the @washingtonpost gas been so false and angry that the times actually apologized to its ..  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28, 2017 dwindling subscribers and readers.They got me wrong right from the beginning and still have not changed course, and never will. DISHONEST  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28, 2017So, in other words, Trump is proving the aides who are leaking the details of his alarming behavior to the press right. He is clueless, dangerously impulsive, petty, and acting like a child. In fact, they are likely leaking this information to the public in a desperate attempt to make Trump behave like a world leader rather than like the man baby that he is, since he gets all of his information from the cable news shows.Whatever the reason, keep the leaks coming, folks. The American public   and, indeed, the press   need to keep the pressure on Trump and let the nation and world know just what a dangerous fool is currently occupying the Oval Office.#RESIST.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",0.0
"Netanyahu, Trump align on Iran ahead of Israeli leader's visit","JERUSALEM/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and new U.S. President Donald Trump, seizing on an Iranian missile test, are nearing common ground on a tougher U.S. policy towards Tehran ahead of their first face-to-face talks at the White House. But people familiar with the Trump administrations thinking say that its evolving strategy is likely to be aimed not at dismantling Irans July 2015 nuclear deal with six world powers, as presidential candidate Trump sometimes advocated, but tightening its enforcement and pressuring the Islamic Republic into renegotiating key provisions. Options under consideration, they say, would include wider scrutiny of Irans compliance by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, including access to Iranian military sites, and seeking to remove sunset terms that allow some curbs on Iranian nuclear activity to start expiring in 10 years and lift other limits after 15 years. In a shift of position for Netanyahu, all signs in Israel point to him being on board with the emerging U.S. plan, though it may prove impossible to get other world powers and Iran to consider revising the landmark nuclear deal. Two years ago, Netanyahu infuriated the Obama White House by addressing the U.S. Congress to rally hawkish opposition to a budding Iran pact he condemned as a historic mistake that should be torn up. As Trump and Netanyahu prepare for their Feb. 15 meeting, focus has shifted to Irans ballistic missile test last week. The White House said the missile launch was not a direct breach of the nuclear deal but violates the spirit of that.  Trump responded by slapping fresh sanctions on individuals and entities, some of them linked to Irans elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC). A U.N. Security Council resolution underpinning the nuclear pact urges Iran to refrain from testing missiles designed to be able to carry nuclear warheads, but imposes no obligation. However, Trump tweeted, Iran is playing with fire and they dont appreciate how kind President Obama was to them. Not me! Trumps national security adviser, Michael Flynn, warned that Washington would no longer tolerate Irans provocations. Netanyahu appreciated the comments. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Irans supreme leader, on Tuesday dismissed the U.S. decision to put Iran on notice over its missile tests and called Trump the real face of American corruption. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was quoted as saying Iran would not renegotiate the nuclear deal. Beyond the rhetoric, the missile test gave the new Republican president and the conservative Israeli leader - who had an often acrimonious relationship with Trumps Democratic predecessor Barack Obama - an early chance to show they are on the same page in seeking to restrain Iranian military ambitions. Netanyahu wrote on Facebook last week: At my upcoming meeting with President Trump in Washington, I intend to raise the renewal of sanctions against Iran in this context and in other contexts. Iranian aggression must not go unanswered. In London for talks with British Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday, Netanyahu said responsible nations should follow  Trumps imposition of new sanctions as Iran remained a deadly menace to Israel and threatens the world. But he stopped short of any call to cancel the nuclear accord. Israeli officials privately acknowledged that he would not advocate ripping up a deal that has been emphatically  reaffirmed by the other big power signatories - Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China - since Trumps election victory. Russia said on Monday it disagreed with Trumps assessment of Iran as the number one terrorist state and a Russian diplomat said any move to rework the nuclear pact would inflame Middle East tensions. Dont try to fix what is not broken, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said. Trumps stance could weaken the hand of pragmatists in Tehran who have been willing to negotiate a detente with the West after decades of volatile confrontation, a former senior Iranian official said. Under the accord, Tehran received relief from global economic sanctions and in return committed to capping its uranium enrichment well below the level needed for bomb-grade material, cutting the number of its centrifuge enrichment machines by two-thirds, reducing its enriched uranium stockpile and submitting to a more intrusive IAEA inspections regime. Diplomats close to the IAEA consider the deal a success so far, voicing little concern with overall Iranian compliance - despite Netanyahus insistence that it will only pave the Islamic Republics path towards nuclear weapons once major restrictions expire 15 years after its signing. With German, French and British firms busy cultivating new business with Iran, Washingtons peers in the six-power group almost surely would rebuff any U.S. thrust to reopen the deal. Daniel Shapiro, who recently ended his tenure as U.S. ambassador to Israel under Obama, told Reuters he would be surprised if Trump and Netanyahu determined so early in the time working together that they would rather scrap that agreement than try to enforce it in a tough manner and put other pressures unrelated to that deal on the Iranians. Some foreign policy expertssay U.S. efforts to tighten the screws on Iran could seek to goad it into ditching the nuclear accord in hopes that Tehran - and not Washington - would then have to shoulder international blame for its collapse. According to Israels Haaretz newspaper, an Israeli intelligence assessment recently presented to Netanyahu said revoking the pact would be an error, causing a chasm between Washington and other signatories like Russia and China. Amos Yadlin, former head of Israeli military intelligence, said there were many areas outside the deal where pressure could be applied on Iran to change what he called its negative behavior of subversiveness, supporting terrorism. But beyond new sanctions and sharpened rhetoric, analysts say,it is unclear how far Trump could go. Arguments for restraint would include the risk of military escalation in the Gulf, out of which 40 percent of the worlds seaborne crude oil is shipped, and strong European support for the nuclear deal. Though the new U.S. strategy is in the early stages of development, the Trump administration, the sources say, is considering arange of measures, including seeking zero tolerance for any Iranian violations. Trumps aides accused the Obama administration of turning a blind eye to some alleged Iranian infractions to avoid anything that would undermine confidence in the integrity of the deal. Obama administration officials denied being soft on Iran. Other U.S. strategy options, the sources say, include sanctioning Iranian industries that aid missile development and designating as a terrorist group the Revolutionary Guards, accused by U.S. officials of fuelling Middle East proxy wars. That designation could also dissuade foreign investment in Iran because the Guards oversee a sprawling business empire there. ",1.0

Obama scolds Senate Republicans for Supreme Court threat,"RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Tuesday vowed to pick an indisputably qualified nominee for the Supreme Court and chided Republicans who control the U.S. Senate for threatening to block him from filling the pivotal vacancy. Obama told senators he has a constitutional duty to nominate a new justice after Saturdays death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia and reminded them of their constitutional obligation to do their job and vote to approve or reject his nominee. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the seat on the nations highest court should remain vacant until Obamas successor takes office in January so voters can have a say on the selection when they cast ballots in the Nov. 8 presidential election. Im amused when I hear people who claim to be strict interpreters of the Constitution suddenly reading into it a whole series of provisions that are not there, Obama said. The Constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now, Obama, a former constitutional law professor, told a news conference at the close of a two-day meeting with leaders from Southeast Asia. In Washington, Scalias chair in the courts ornate chamber was draped with black wool crepe in accordance with court tradition following a justices death. The court said Scalias body will lie in repose at the Supreme Court building on Friday before his funeral Mass at the  Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington on Saturday. Obamas nominee could shift the balance of power on the court, which had five conservatives and four liberals before Scalias death. The president said he understood the high stakes for Republican senators under pressure to vote against his pick for the lifetime appointment, who conceivably would be the deciding vote in cases where the court is split. Obama said the venom and rancor in Washington has led to the Senate routinely blocking his nominations for lower courts and other posts but said the Supreme Court is too important to get trapped in political gridlock.  Its the one court where we would expect elected officials to rise above day-to-day politics, he said. But Republicans have pointed out that Obama and members of his cabinet, who were then in the Senate, were not above trying to block the Supreme Court nomination of Justice Samuel Alito by then-President George W. Bush in 2006. While he complained about filibusters today, he joined filibusters while in the Senate, said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Asked about his record, Obama acknowledged Democrats have played politics with nominations, too, through what he described as strategic decisions that ultimately did not block the presidents nominee. But what is also true is Justice Alito is on the bench right now, Obama said. Obama shed little light on whom he would choose or how the White House will try to finesse his choice through Congress. Were going to find somebody who is an outstanding legal mind, somebody who cares deeply about our democracy and cares about rule of law, Obama said. Im going to present somebody who indisputably is qualified for the seat, and any fair-minded person, even somebody who disagrees with my politics, would say would serve with honor and integrity on the court, he added. Asked directly if that meant he would choose a moderate candidate, Obama said, No. He said there was more than enough time for the Senate to hold hearings and vote on his nominee without the White House needing to resort to a procedure known as a recess appointment to get around the Senate when it is not in session. But he did not explicitly rule out a recess appointment. Republican Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, whose panel weighs Supreme Court nominations, said on Tuesday he will wait until Obama names his pick to fill the vacancy before deciding whether to hold confirmation hearings. Grassley has offered mixed messages since Scalias death on how the Senate should proceed on the vacancy, alternating hardline views on blocking any nominee with comments not ruling out hearings.  I would wait until the nominee is made before I would make any decisions about confirmation hearings, Grassley said, according to Radio Iowa. In other words, take it a step at a time. ",1.0
 Stock Market Literally SHUTS DOWN And Dollar Drops As Conservatives Kill Economy By Voting For Trump,"The prospect of Donald Trump winning the presidency is scaring the hell out of the world s markets, and conservatives are to blame.The economy is facing a free-fall that will make Brexit look like a yawn if Donald Trump pulls out a win. As the electoral votes came in for Trump on Tuesday night, Dow Jones futures dropped an astonishing 750 points while the value of the dollar dropped just over one percent.According to Market Watch,Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 750 points before modestly paring losses as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump s lead in the Electoral College over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton widened.Dow futures YMZ6, -3.63% were off 700 points, or 3.9%, at 17,574. The U.S. dollar USDJPY, -3.23% slumped 3.2% to  101.64. The ICE U.S. Dollar index, a measure of the dollar s strength against a basket of six rivals, was off 1.2% at 96.68.And the damage was not isolated to the United States as Asian and Australian markets also fell and the Mexican peso dropped in value to a new record low as well.In Asia, stocks opened sharply lower, with Hong Kong s Hang Seng index HSI, -2.82% down 607 points, or 2.7%, at 22,299.

If the world economy takes a major hit and consequently hurts this country and erases all of the progress we have made since the Great Recession eight years ago, Republicans will OWN this. It will be their fault and they will be the only ones to blame.This election is a seriously embarrassing moment in our history and our reputation around the world just went from one of respect to a total joke.These conservative voters in rural areas just got duped into thinking that this billionaire blowhard actually cares about them, their families, their jobs, and their financial future. But they are about to be severely disappointed because Trump only cares about himself. He does not care about making sure people get a fair wage. He does not care about all those blue-collar workers who somehow think Trump will bring back manufacturing jobs. This is a guy who imports materials from China because he d rather buy cheap instead of buying from American companies.So if you are a conservative and you lose your job, home, and savings. Look in the mirror and blame yourself. You caused your own misery and you deserve every bit of it.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",0.0
 Five Times Five-Time Draft Dodger Donald Trump Insulted Those Who Actually Served,"Instead of honoring Purple Heart Day, Trump began his morning by launching a vicious attack against Richard Blumenthal.Interesting to watch Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut talking about hoax Russian collusion when he was a phony Vietnam con artist!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2017Never in U.S.history has anyone lied or defrauded voters like Senator Richard Blumenthal. He told stories about his Vietnam battles and .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2017 conquests, how brave he was, and it was all a lie. He cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness like a child. Now he judges collusion?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2017Trump later followed that up by posting an image of himself with a Purple Heart recipient.On #PurpleHeartDay?I thank all the brave men and women who have sacrificed in battle for this GREAT NATION! #USA?? pic.twitter.com/QmfdLSLp6p  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2017And then he attacked Blumenthal again.I think Senator Blumenthal should take a nice long vacation in Vietnam, where he lied about his service, so he can at least say he was there  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2017This despicable attack against a man who actually wore the uniform of his country for six years as a United States Marine is just the latest example of Trump insulting members of our armed forces.Here s are five more.Early on in his campaign, Trump insulted Senator John McCain, who spent years as a prisoner of war during Vietnam suffering gruesome torture that affects him to this day. He chose to undergo that torture rather than be released before other soldiers, because he had connections they did not. He s not a war hero,  Trump said.  He s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren t captured. McCain is a recipient of the Purple Heart and a Silver Star among many other decorations in recognition of his service and sacrifice.In the final months of the campaign, Trump attacked a Gold Star family for simply challenging him to read the Constitution.Khizr and Ghazala Khan spoke to the Democratic National Convention in opposition to Trump and his racism against Muslims. Trump responded by smearing the Khans, suggesting that Ghazala was forbidden from speaking.Their son, Captain Humayun Khan, was killed in Iraq while saving the lives of his fellow soldiers. He was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart for his sacrifice.A month prior to the election, Trump appeared to suggest that veterans with PTSD are weak. When you talk about the mental health problems, when people come back from war and combat   and they see things that maybe a lot of the folks in this room have seen many times over and you re strong and you can handle it, but a lot of people can t handle it. In August 2016, Trump once again belittled the service of wounded veterans by taking a Purple Heart as a gift from a veteran, remarking that getting one this way was much easier than getting one the hard way. I always wanted to get the Purple Heart. This was much easier. The worst insult to veterans is the fact that Trump repeatedly dodged the draft during Vietnam. He received five deferments during the war despite being physically fit and having gone to military school.Trump was finally declared medically unfit because of a supposed bone spur in his foot, a condition that even seasoned professional athletes play through.It should also be noted that Trump has failed to produce any evidence proving that his bone spur was real.Trump would later remark that his  personal Vietnam  was sleeping around and not getting a sexually transmitted disease. Trump s  personal Vietnam  was taking place at the same time John McCain was still working to recover from his injuries during the real Vietnam War.And those examples are just the tip of the iceberg. Since taking office, Trump insulted World War II veterans by ranting on Twitter instead of honoring the anniversary of D-Day and insulted veterans across the nation by attacking transgender service members.Donald Trump can say he loves the troops all he wants. His past words and actions make it clear that he is lying every time he makes such a declaration. Trump only cares about himself.Read more:Featured Image: Screenshot",0.0
"Catalonia's leader rules out snap election, crisis deepens","MADRID/BARCELONA (Reuters) - Catalonia s leader Carles Puigdemont on Thursday said he would not hold a new regional election to break the deadlock between  Madrid and separatists wanting to split from Spain, sharpening a political crisis that could turn into direct confrontation. Puigdemont had been expected to announce an election to head off moves by Madrid to take direct control of the autonomous region in the next few days. But, speaking in the courtyard of the regional government headquarters in Barcelona, Puigdemont said the central government had not provided sufficient guarantees that holding an election would prevent the imposition of direct rule.  I was ready to call an election if guarantees were given. There is no guarantee that justifies calling an election today,  Puigdemont said. He said it was now up to the Catalan parliament to move forward with a mandate to break from Spain following an independence referendum that took place on Oct. 1 - a vote which Madrid had declared illegal and tried to stop. Some independence supporters are pushing him to unilaterally declare independence. Late on Thursday, the regional government s business head resigned over his opposition to a unilateral declaration, a sign of growing division in the separatist movement. Puigdemont s stand sets the stage for the Spanish Senate on Friday to approve the take-over of Catalonia s institutions and police, and give the government in Madrid the power to remove the Catalan president. But this could spark confrontation on the streets as some independence supporters have promised to mount a campaign of civil disobedience. Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, speaking in a Senate committee, said:  The independence leaders have shown their true face - they have promised a dream but are performing tricks.  The aim of Article 155   the constitutional trigger for direct rule   was to permit any election to take place in a normal and neutral situation, she said. The Spanish government has said it would call such a vote within six months of taking over Catalonia. The political crisis, the gravest since Spain s return to democracy four decades ago, has divided Catalonia itself and caused deep resentment in other parts of the country. It has also prompted a flight of business from the wealthy region and worried other European leaders who see it as fanning separatist sentiment elsewhere on the continent. It was not clear whether Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would immediately enforce direct rule or simply seek the Senate s authorization to do so without making it effective on the ground. Exactly how the central government would enforce it in practical terms, and how Catalan civil service and regional police would react, is also uncertain. National police used heavy-handed tactics to try to prevent the Oct. 1 referendum from taking place, drawing accusations that they were resorting to the repressive behavior of the 1939-1975 Franco dictatorship. However, in a fast-moving battle of wills that has seen both sides stake out hard positions and try to keep each other guessing, it was not impossible that a sudden breakthrough could  be made in the next 24 hours. Spain's IBEX .IBEX closed up 1.9 percent as hopes of such a breakthrough fueled optimism among investors. Catalonia contributes a fifth of Spain's economy, the fourth-largest in the euro zone. Most Spanish blue-chips posted substantial gains, notably Banco Sabadell (SABE.MC) and Banco Santander (SAN.MC), both up 3.2 percent. CRACKS IN PRO-INDEPENDENCE CAMP According to Spanish media, Puigdemont is ready to call an election if the government drops Article 155, releases two senior secessionist leaders who are in jail and removes national police from Catalonia. Even if the Senate voted for direct rule on Friday, Puigdemont would not be stripped of his powers until Saturday when the law is published in Spain s official state gazette. Ander Gil Garcia, a spokesman for the Socialist group in the Senate, said:  We are in the last hours of the penultimate day in which we can avoid what nobody wants.  He appealed to Puigdemont to call a regional election  and avoid a disaster from which Catalonia and Spain would take a long time to recover.  A regional election could either strengthen Puigdemont s mandate if pro-independence parties won or allow him a graceful exit if they did not. Cracks though are beginning to appear in an increasingly-frustrated Catalan independence movement. The Catalan government s business head, Santi Vila, who has opposed a unilateral declaration of independence, said on Thursday he had resigned and said his  attempts at dialogue had failed.  Earlier on Thursday, when it was thought Puigdemont would announce an election, he was denounced by some angry independence supporters as a traitor. Several hundred gathered outside the regional government headquarters in protest. Some pro-secession lawmakers and mayors announced they would step down. Catalonia s pro-independence party ERC would leave the regional government if Puigdemont called a snap election, a party source said.  And far-left party CUP, which supports Puigdemont s minority government, said it would oppose a vote. Albert Ribas, a 37-year-old hotel director listening to a radio in Barcelona s Sant Jaume Square, said it had been a hard day.  We have lost our dignity. But I suppose we had to show the outside world that we re still making the effort to talk to the Spanish government. But again we see we have hit a wall.  ",1.0

 WATCH: CNN Analyst Calls Trump A Son Of A Bitch On The Air,"Donald Trump s destructive vision of America is eliciting strong reaction from millions of people across the country, including political analyst David Gergen.Trump delivered a speech in Cincinnati, Ohio in which he continued to use divisive rhetoric and attacked the media before once again calling on all Americans to bow down and kiss his ass for the good of the nation.During an appearance on CNN on Thursday, Gergen slapped down Trump s disingenuous call for unity and put aside niceties as he eulogized the America that has been a respected world power for decades. I think if there was any doubt that we re putting an end to one chapter in American history and moving to a new one, he dispelled that tonight. This is goodbye to American leadership in the world. Goodbye to globalization. He s bringing America home. He s going to lead a nativist, nationalistic, populist movement and if you want to join up with him fine. If you don t, forget it. Gergen said he got a  very clear impression  that Trump is going to ignore foreign policy and leave it to a team of advisers and focus on domestic policy in his  pugilistic, narcissistic way  without regard for who he hurts.Indeed, Trump s domestic policy could include dismantling Medicare and Social Security, the two most successful and popular government programs in American history. Trump also intends to attack minimum wage and give bigots the kind of freedom to discriminate against others that they haven t had in a long time. Even the Voting Rights Act, Civil Rights Act, and women s rights are going to be targeted. He s in charge,  Gergen continued.  And he has a lot of support in the Congress. That kind of speech will fire up his base, and it s going to leave a lot of other people I knew I didn t like the son of a bitch. Here s the video via YouTube. Gergen s remarks are at the three minute mark:Donald Trump s agenda needs to be obstructed at every turn over the next four years. He has no intention of uniting America or doing what s best for America. He only cares about what is best for himself and his cronies. Not a single word that comes out of his mouth is true and if our democracy is to survive, we must resist. Republicans refused to unite behind President Obama for eight years. It time for Democrats to show Trump the same courtesy.Featured Image: Screenshot",0.0
 Hillary Absolutely DESTROYS Trumps Stupid Slogan In One Perfect Tweet (IMAGE),"There s absolutely nothing more frustrating than hearing Donald Trump and his band of merry morons repeatedly say we need to  Make America Great Again.  Newsflash: it already is great. However, for the racist base that he s desperately trying to appeal to, who d love to go back to an America filled with discrimination and horrific policy,  great  is likely synonymous with  hate,  or even  white.  Basically his rhetoric can be summed up with,  Make America Able To Hate Again    because that s what his minions are voting for, and proof of that hate and racism can be found and any one of his many, many events.Likely tired of seeing and hearing this slogan over and over and over, one person seemed to have just about enough, so they took to their Twitter feed to make it known they re not only over it, but they re going to correct it. That person? Hillary Clinton.The Democratic candidate and former Secretary of State, likely alongside her staff, tweeted out during the latest GOP debate, that in all legitimacy was a clusterf*ck, a far better slogan that actually fits with the times and doesn t base itself on hate.She wrote: America never stopped being great. We just need to make it work for everyone   Make America even greater. America never stopped being great. We just need to make it work for everyone. #GOPdebate pic.twitter.com/RiyhfZAAZ1  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 26, 2016She s exactly right. The nation never stopped being great. In fact, over the course of a century we ve seen the barriers holding back women, people of color and the LGBT community start to disappear before our eyes. And while we have so much further to go, we are better off than we were. FAR better off, but  we just need to make it work for everyone.  A slogan that the former Secretary of State has been pushing forward in regards to not only better treatment of women, people of color and the gay community, but also in regards to economic inequality and the barriers still holding many Americans back.Kudos to the Clinton for destroying Trump s stupid slogan where it stands. America is already great, but we together can make it greater.Featured imag via YouTube/Instagram/Twitter",0.0
" Harry Reid UNLEASHES Anti-Trump Rant On Senate Floor, Calls Him A Human Leech (VIDEO)","Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid has it out for Republican nominee Donald Trump.On Thursday on the Senate floor, Senator Reid (D-Nev.) unleashed a rant against the business mogul with a bitterness that makes you wonder just how long he had been holding it in. Reid is approaching retirement as January draws near, and it s clear that the Democratic leader wants America to understand just how important it is to make sure that the country isn t left in Trump s little, orange, greedy hands.Making reference to a Newsweek article that questions the Trump Organization s international business ties and suggests that a President Trump could be disastrous for national security, Reid called Trump  a spoiled brat  and  a notorious con artist  whose questionable, scammy business practices would only spill over into his administration if he becomes President. Reid said: Let s be clear about Donald Trump. He s a spoiled brat, raised in plenty, who inherited a fortune, used his money to make more money, and he did a lot of it by swindling working men and women. Why would he change as president? The answer is simple. Trump won t change. He is asking us to let him get rich scamming America. Donald Trump is only trying to help one person   Donald Trump.   If given the opportunity, Donald Trump will turn America into a big scam, just like Trump University. Reid also raised some eyebrows by calling Trump a  human leech. Trump is a human leech, who will bleed the country and sit at his golf resort laughing at the money he has made. You can watch Reid s amazing anti-Trump rant below: Reid s rant is pretty epic and judging from his other statements about Trump, there s probably many more Trump disses on the way before his retirement. Just earlier this week, Reid attacked Trump for insulting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton s health by calling Trump fat and drawing attention to his own unhealthy lifestyle. Reid said: Take a look at this character that s running for president. He complains about her health? What does he do? He s 70 years old, he s not slim and trim, he brags about eating fast food every day. Look at his health a little bit. Let s just say we hope Harry Reid keeps this up!Featured image via Alex Wong / Getty Images",0.0
Not again! German media bemoan grand coalition scenario after limp TV duel,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A mood of pre-election apathy rippled through German media on Monday, as commentators concluded Angela Merkel s rival for chancellor had blown his best chance of depriving her of fourth term in office. With three weeks to go until polling day, several national newspapers taking stock the morning after a lackluster two-way televised debate concluded that a re-run of the grand coalition of Merkel s conservatives and challenger Martin Schulz s Social Democrats (SPD) was likely.  Angela Merkel and Martin Schulz barely showed any differences in their only direct face-off. Why don t we just set the grand coalition up again now?  magazine Der Spiegel said on its website, adding the debate would not have changed voters  existing preferences. That would be a continuation of the team that has governed Germany for the last four years. But that combination has in the past been viewed as a last resort, and surveys suggest a three-way coalition between the conservatives, Greens and the Free Democrats (FDP) as an alternative option. Polls over the past three months have consistently shown Merkel s conservatives holding a double-digit lead over the SPD - but the gap has never stretched so far as to give her CDU/CSU alliance a parliamentary majority. Polls showed Merkel was also the winner of Sunday s duel - a disappointment for Schulz, who had hoped he could use his only direct clash with her to turn his party s fortunes around.  We re at risk of another grand coalition,  read the headline in mass-selling Bild newspaper. It said while Schulz had tried to attack  the eternal chancellor , he had done so with velvet gloves, pointing out that he often said he shared Merkel s opinion. Bild said the pair had failed to differentiate themselves.  There were two professional politicians speaking and you just couldn t shake off the suspicion that both of them could work together in government without much friction,  it added. Local newspaper Berliner Zeitung newspaper s front page showed a scorecard that read 0:0 - a draw for both candidates.  It was supposed to be the first climax in the race for the chancellery ... But substantive accents were missing. Undecided votes were likely unconvinced by either of the candidates,  it said. The rivals  body language was also telling, it said, with Schulz smiling a lot while Merkel often looked  as though she was witnessing something that she didn t quite like.  Newspaper Handelsblatt said Schulz had not really attacked the incumbent chancellor, adding:  Martin Schulz doesn t want to be chancellor in September apparently but rather Angela Merkel s office manager.  But Berlin s Tagesspiegel newspaper said Schulz had scored points for taking more decisive positions on Turkey, pensions and the need to punish the German automotive industry for the diesel emissions scandal.  When it came to showing hard edges, Martin Schulz was more convincing,  it said, adding,  this evening may have changed things.  ",1.0
" Bristol Palin Being Sued For Custody And Child Support, Probably Wishes She Had Practiced Abstinence Now","Bristol Palin brought this upon herself. After all, she could have just practiced what she preached. Now, it s her turn to take responsibility.But she didn t, and now the daughter of America s village idiot has a second out-of-wedlock baby by a second dude, who now wants Bristol to pay him child support as well as give him joint physical custody of the little girl named Sailor Grace.Palin has already been embroiled in battles with her other baby daddy Levi Johnston over their 7-year-old son Tripp. And now she gets to battle Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer.According to legal documents obtained by Radar Online: The parties have reached a final custody and visitation agreement for residing in the same community and have executed, personally and through their attorneys, a confidential stipulation regarding custody. Therefore, the only pending issue to be addressed by the Court is the matter of past and future child support. And Bristol Palin isn t the struggling single mom she pretends to be. She has a lot of money to make child support payments.After getting knocked up and giving birth the first time around, Palin became a paid spokesperson for for an abstinence-only campaign, making $262,000 in 2009 alone. And then she got a $100,000 payday by selling her story to In Touch Weekly. And Palin owned a $400,000 modern lakefront home in Alaska, pictures of which you can see here.Combine all of that with the millions of dollars her mom has suckered from conservatives across the country via donations and book sales and it becomes quite clear that Bristol can afford to pay child support.One would think Bristol would learn her lesson by now. But apparently she s quite comfortable being paid to preach abstinence while having sex and babies with any guy she meets. The hypocrisy is stunning and makes it hard to feel sorry for her.For years now, she has criticized women and girls for being irresponsible when it comes to sex and birth control. Now it s time for her to take responsibility for her own actions, which means she should have to pay child support in a timely manner so that her child can have at least one parent who has some discipline and isn t a spoiled brat who whines all the time.Featured Image: Inquistr",0.0
 Republicans Sabotage Obamacare So They Can Claim It Doesnt Work,"Did your Obamacare premiums go up this year? Blame Republicans.In their effort to destroy President Obama s signature legislative achievement, Republicans voted to repeal the law a bazillion times since taking over the House. They ve also filed lawsuit after lawsuit hoping that a federal court will see things their way and strike it down.However, both efforts have failed miserably as the Supreme Court has ruled against Republicans in two major cases. Plus President Obama would simply veto any repeal bill should it reach his desk.Republicans desperately want to use Obamacare as a campaign talking point this year. The only problem is that Obamacare is turning out to be a successful healthcare program that is becoming as ingrained in our society as Medicare and Medicaid as more and more Americans sign up and get health insurance.According to the Washington Post, more than 11.3 million Americans have signed up for Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act.Furthermore, CNBC reports that  fewer than 1 in 10 Americans lacked health insurance in 2015, the first time ever in the nation s history that the uninsured rate has fallen so low, and a clear sign of Obamacare s impact. It s a stunning victory for a program that has only been in full effect since 2014. Much of that success is due to the Medicaid expansion part of the law, which means even less people would be uninsured if Republican-controlled states had not refused to expand Medicaid for their own citizens.Obamacare has also created jobs despite Republican doomsday predictions.All of these successes not only makes Obamacare more popular, they make it harder for Republicans to repeal it without suffering major consequences on Election Day.That s why Republicans have devised an underhanded new strategy in their continuing obsession to kill Obamacare.Talking Points Memo reports:In late 2014, Republicans inserted a provision in budget omnibus legislation that tinkered with what s known as the risk corridors program, which buoys insurers who spend more money than they planned for on covering populations that are sicker than anticipated.The provision resurfaced in the political discourse last fall when Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) took it on a victory tour during his presidential campaign, bragging that he stopped a health insurance  bailout.  The legislation did not so much end the program as screw up the mechanism by which money can be carved out to fund it. The risk corridors can now only be funded by transferring profits from insurers whose populations cost them less than expected, and the government can no longer pull from savings elsewhere in the law to make up the difference.Washington and Lee University School of Law health law expert Timothy Jost explained to TPM that while the tweak isn t near enough to destroy the law, it has caused  significant problems,  and is a  major factor contributing to premium increases this year. Basically, Republicans are deliberately making minor tweaks to Obamacare mechanisms so that certain parts of the program become weaker than they were originally. New reports then come out showing that premiums went up. Then Republicans use those new reports to brag about how Obamacare is broken even though they were the ones who broke it in the first place.So if you discover that your healthcare premiums have risen this year, you can blame Republicans for that and you can make sure they never screw with your healthcare again by punishing them at the voting booth this November.Featured image via Flickr",0.0
Letter with granular matter sent to Trump's son in New York,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Authorities were investigating a threatening letter containing a granular substance that was sent to Donald Trumps son urging an end to the elders presidential campaign, a New York City police official said on Friday.

There was a substance inside that is being tested, its not lethal, the official said. The letter, which contained threats over Trump continuing his campaign, was being examined by law enforcement experts, the official said. No suspects have been identified.

Trump Supreme Court nominee's confirmation hearing to start March 20,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee will hold its confirmation hearing for President Donald Trumps U.S. Supreme Court nominee, conservative federal appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch, beginning on March 20, the panels Republican chairman said on Thursday. The hearing is likely to last three to four days, with Gorsuch and committee members making opening statements on the first day, the nominee facing questions on the second day and outside experts also testifying, Senator Chuck Grassley said. Grassley said in a statement that Gorsuch, nominated by Trump on Jan. 31, has so far met every demand posed by Democrats, who are the minority party in the Senate but can still delay action if they can muster enough votes. Hes a mainstream judge.Hes displayed independence. Hes met with dozens of senators who have nothing but positive things to say. He is well-qualified and respected, Grassley said. Supreme Court nominees require Senate confirmation for the lifetime job on the nine-justice court. With four liberals and four conservatives now on the court, Gorsuchs confirmation would restore the conservative majority that had existed for decades until the February 2016 death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Democrats, still furious over the Republican-led Senates refusal last year to consider Democratic President Barack Obamas nominee Merrick Garland to replace Scalia, have raised questions about whether Gorsuch would be willing to demonstrate independence from Trump if confirmed to the job. In light of Trumps pointed criticism of judges who ruled against him in the past, Democrats are likely to question Gorsuch about the importance of an independent judiciary. After courts put on hold Trumps ban on people entering the United States from seven Muslim-majority countries, the president criticized the proceedings as disgraceful, called one of the jurists a so-called judge and labeled the judiciary so political.  Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said last week Gorsuch told him during a private meeting that Trumps comments about the judiciary were disheartening and demoralizing, an account that Gorsuchs spokesman, Ron Bonjean, confirmed but Trump disputed. The Senates top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, last week accused Gorsuch of avoiding answering questions like the plague during their private meeting and dodging efforts to gauge his judicial independence. Trumps fellow Republicans control the Senate 52-48 but Schumer has insisted Gorsuch would need to win 60 votes, rather than a simple majority, to move toward confirmation. Democrats can seek to use a procedural maneuver to block a confirmation vote if Gorsuchs supporters cannot muster 60 votes, although Republicans could change the Senate rules. If the hearing goes smoothly and the full Senate votes to confirm him soon afterward, Gorsuch could be on the court before the end of the courts current term in June. ",1.0
Obama praises Argentina's 'man in a hurry' Macri for reforms,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday championed Argentinas new center-right leader Mauricio Macri as an example for other countries in Latin America, praising the fast pace of reforms to strengthen the economy. Obama, on a two-day visit to Argentina that marks a detente after years of tensions, said Argentina under Macri was poised to play a more influential role on the global stage.  In his first 100 days in office, Macri has distanced himself from South Americas leftist bloc, old allies of former President Cristina Fernandez, and sought a thaw in relations with Western capitals as he seeks new investment in Latin Americas No. 3 economy. I can tell you President Macri is a man in hurry, Obama told a joint news conference after the two leaders held talks. Im impressed because he has moved rapidly on so many of the reforms that he promised, to create more sustainable and inclusive economic growth, to reconnect Argentina with the global economy and the world community, he said. Macri offers Obama a new ally in South America, a region where a strong leftist bloc turned its back on Washington over the past decade but where public opinion is now shifting toward the political center as governments grapple with graft scandals and an economic slowdown. Argentina is re-assuming its traditional leadership role in the region and around the world, Obama said.   His trip to Argentina to forge a new friendship follows a historic visit to former Cold War foe Cuba that aimed to boost U.S. credibility across Latin America. For years, much of the region took a dim view of Washingtons longstanding policy of trying to force change on Communist-ruled Cuba by isolating it, a strategy that Obama has cast aside. Macri said Obamas visit marked the start of new mature relations in which the countries would cooperate on issues ranging from trade to fighting international drug trafficking. Macri has lifted capital and trade controls, slashed bloated power subsidies and cut a debt deal with holdout creditors in the United States. But he still has to grapple with double-digit inflation, a yawning fiscal deficit and a shortage of hard currency, and has made securing new foreign investment flows a priority. The American Chamber of Commerce in Argentina said  U.S. firms would invest $2.3 billion in Argentina over the next 18 months, including more than $100 million each from General Motors Co, Dow Chemical Co, AES Corp and Ford Motor Co. Argentine Finance Minister Alfonso Prat-Gay urged business leaders, at a forum where the new investment flows were announced, to think long-term and said policies aimed at cutting inflation and reinvigorating growth would be felt in the second half of the year. Weve cleaned out the rubbish, Prat-Gay said in reference to Fernandezs protectionist policies that stunted investment. Now were entering the starting gates. Obama said the two governments would work to identify barriers impeding greater trade flows between the two economies, adding that a free trade agreement was something that might lie at the end of the process. Right now theres a lot of underbrush, a lot of unnecessary trade irritants and commercial irritants that can be cleared away administratively and thats some of the work that we intend to do right away, Obama said. Foreign companies operating in Argentina routinely complain about costly customs requirements, cumbersome red tape and strong workers rights. Obama said Argentina could be an effective partner in the fight against drug trafficking and organized crime and said both countries would work together in response to the Zika virus that has spread across parts of South America at lightning speed. The two countries announced an agreement on joint steps to fight climate change including working to cut carbon emissions from air flights and integrating solar and wind power into electricity grids. Crowds have cheered Obamas motorcade as it travels along Buenos Aires tree-lined boulevards, handing the U.S. leader a friendlier reception than his predecessor George W. Bush, whose presence at a Summit of the Americas in 2005 was met with protests and snubbed by then President Nestor Kirchner. But left-wing political parties have promised protests on Thursday, which coincides with the 40th anniversary of the coup on March 24, 1976, that installed right-wing military rule.     In an era when Cold War thinking often put Washington behind right-wing governments in the region, the United States initially backed the 1976-1983 dictatorship, during which as many as 30,000 people were killed.  Obama said he would visit a memorial to victims of the Dirty War to pay tribute to the Argentines who stood up against human rights violations, and re-affirmed that his administration would declassify U.S. military and intelligence records related to the junta. I hope this gesture also helps to rebuild trust that may have been lost between our two countries, Obama said. ",1.0
" Ammon Bundy Arrested, Ryan Bundy And Tarp Man Shot After Confrontation With Police (VIDEO)","The ammosexual terrorists currently staging an armed occupation in a federal bird sanctuary in Oregon are standing their ground amid reports that Ammon Bundy and three of their compatriots have been arrested. Monumental imbecile, godawful radio host, and wannabe journalist Pete Santilli s live feed cut out as he stood in front of a hospital near the Malheur Wildlife Refuge to announce that Bundy and others had been arrested, and two had been shot.Santilli says that one of the Faithful received a phone call from the FBI: The word is right now that everyone   and this is the message that they wanted to convey, and if anybody s watching this stream at the refuge   the FBI has conveyed a message: you are free to go, and you must leave now. The confirmation is as follows,  Santilli said.  It is reported that Ammon Bundy is in custody by police. The roads are on lockdown reports of shots being fired and the report that we re getting right now is that two people have been shot.   WRGB reports that one of the militants is dead: Officials said it all began with a traffic stop while Bundy and some of his followers were en route to a community meeting in John Day, about 70 miles away.Shots were fired after FBI agents, Oregon State troopers and other law enforcement agencies made the stop. CNN reports its unclear who fired first.Details of the arrest and confrontation remain unknown, but charges are pending related to the group s 25-day takeover of the wildlife refuge.According to Oregon Live, Ryan Bundy suffered a minor gunshot wound, and Santilli s staff reports that  Tarp Man  Lavoy Finicum, who once warned that he would take death over jail, was also struck by gunfire. The name of the deceased has not been officially released. However, Assemblywoman Michele Fiore says that Finicum is, indeed, dead: If in fact Ammon Bundy has been taken into custody,  he added,  It s not a good thing. Certainly not a good thing.  During the stream, Santilli received a phone call and the stream cut out shortly afterward.  According to Oregon Live, aside from Ammon and Ryan Bundy, the following were arrested:Ryan W. Payne, 32, of Anaconda, Mont., Brian Cavalier, 44, of Bunkerville, Nevada, and Shawna J. Cox, 59, of Kanab, Utah.They have all been charged with conspiracy to impede federal officers, a felony.It is unclear if the remaining domestic terrorists will go home, but it seems unlikely. Many have pledged to fight to the death, with the group begging for clean underwear, tampons, and snacks to survive a long stay at the refuge.  What this means for the occupation remains to be known, but we sincerely hope that Y all Qaeda recognize defeat, give up peacefully, and slink home with their tails between their legs before lives are lost.Watch Santilli report the arrest below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-jYxOSnWY&w=560&h=315]The militants back at  base  are backing down, calling for  all patriots  to join them in defending their illegally-occupied land:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RoeNxjaShk]Militant Jon Ritzheimer posted a video of himself saying goodbye to his children.

Sanders releases universal healthcare plan before Democratic debate,"CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders released details on Sunday evening about his Medicare-for-all universal healthcare funding plan and how he would pay for it. The plan was released hours before Sanders was to square off in a Democratic presidential debate in Charleston, South Carolina, against Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and front-runner for the Democratic nomination, and former Maryland Governor Martin OMalley.  Clintons campaign had taken aim at Sanders in recent days, saying the U.S. senator from Vermont had not said how he plans to pay for his healthcare plan and that he needed to before the first party-nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 1. Sanders said that expanding Medicare, a government-run program that insures the elderly, would save $6 trillion over the next 10 years when compared with the current system, which was established by President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law, the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Individuals would pay a 2.2 percent premium and employers would pay a 6.2 percent payroll tax to fund the healthcare plan. Individuals making $250,000 to $500,000 a year would pay a tax rate of 37 percent and those making more than $10 million would pay a 52 percent tax rate, according to details provided about the plan. The average annual healthcare costs for a working U.S. family are nearly $5,000 in insurance premiums and another $1,300 on deductibles for care that is not covered, Sanders campaign said. Under Sanders plan, a family of four earning $50,000 would pay $466 to the Medicare program, saving roughly $6,000 per year, the campaign said. Clinton favors building on the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, and has said Sanders state-administered plan would jeopardize the healthcare of those with Republican governors. Sanders has said the federal government would intervene in such a scenario. It would be a mistake to really thrust our country into another contentious national debate about how were going to provide quality, affordable healthcare to everybody, Clinton told CNNs State of the Union program on Sunday. Sanders defended his forthcoming proposal on the same CNN program. I believe healthcare is a right for all people; it will be politically difficult to achieve, but I will maintain that vision and fight for it, Sanders said. Sanders last week tweeted a 1993 photo of himself and Clinton signed by the then-first lady, who was waging her own fight for universal healthcare, which thanked him for his commitment to real access to healthcare for all Americans.

 REPORT: Jared Kushner F**king Furious Over Bannon Activity In White House (DETAILS),"Many people have looked to Donald Trump s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to be a moderating influence on the erratic behavior of his father-in-law. This is largely true, but there s just one problem: From sundown on Friday until sundown on Saturday, Kushner observes Shabat, as he and his wife and children are Orthodox Jews. That means that Trump is left unattended with people like Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon and political operative Stephen Miller influencing his every move and appealing to his worst instincts.This seems to be the reason that some of Trump s biggest, most controversial and bumbling moves have happened on weekends   because these are things far-right extremists like Bannon and Miller are all for, while Kushner never would have allowed them to happen if he could help it. According to a source close to the situation, the timing of these blunders is no coincidence. Here are just a few items that have occurred in Kushner s absence:And of course, we re less than two weeks into the Trump presidency, so who the hell knows what is coming next? Well, it seems that Kushner is not happy with any of these developments at all. He is reportedly increasingly uneasy at the influence of far-right extremists like Miller and Bannon on Trump in his absence. Further, it seems that there is an intense power struggle within the White House, and Kushner seems to be losing. He is incensed at that development as well. He spent copious amounts of time setting up a call between Trump and Mexico s president, only to have Trump blow the whole thing up by impulsively tweeting that he should not meet with President Enrique Pena Nieto if there would be no wall payment. According to Vanity Fair, Kushner was, quote,  fucking furious. In short, Trump is taking his marching orders from Bannon and Miller, and not Kushner, and that isn t good for anyone. Kushner might be a rich, slimy sell-out, but at least he seems to be able to control Trump s worst instincts. Now that said control seems to be badly slipping, we should all be very afraid.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",0.0

LOL! TRUMP TWEETS Hilarious Message To #CrookedHillarySuggests She Gives It Another Try In 2020,"President Trump on Saturday criticized Hillary Clinton, the Democrat he defeated in the 2016 White House race, for her recent and repeated questioning of the election results. Crooked Hillary Clinton is the worst (and biggest) loser of all time,  Trump tweeted.  She just can t stop, which is so good for the Republican Party. Hillary, get on with your life and give it another try in three years! Crooked Hillary Clinton is the worst (and biggest) loser of all time. She just can t stop, which is so good for the Republican Party. Hillary, get on with your life and give it another try in three years!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2017The Republican president was likely responding to a Mother Jones interview published Friday in which Clinton questioned last year s election results, amid evidence that Russia tried to influence the race outcome. She called for an independent commission to investigate the matter.Clinton, in the interview, also alleged voter suppression in the 2016 race, saying,  In a couple of places, most notably Wisconsin, I think it had a dramatic impact on the outcome.   FOX NewsIn case America has forgotten why Donal Trump trounced Hillary in the polls, watch the short clip from their second presidential debate below:The very sick Hillary Clinton barely made it through to the November election without needing a stretcher, while running her very lackadaisical 2016 presidential campaign. It would be very interesting to see Hillary attempt a comeback 4 years later.Watch, as Hillary collapes while attempting to enter her van after leaving a 9-11 memorial service early, reportedly because she was suffering a mysterious medical situation that required her to leave during the ceremony. At first, her campaign said she was suffering from heat exaustion, after the American public refused to buy their excuse,  the campaign then said she had pnuemonia. After several weeks of watching her being propped up and carried around by the arm like a candidate who has one foot on a banana peel and the other in her grave, following her 9-11  incident , we re definitely not buying it.This IS NOT heat related. #HillarysHealth pic.twitter.com/PFNfCEVFrV  John Cardillo (@johncardillo) September 11, 2016And then, there is the long list of crimes committed by Hillary, that she has yet to be prosecuted for.The list of Hillary s crimes continues to grow, even after the election. Just before the 2016 presidential election, Breitbart put together a list of a few of the most well-documented crimes and national security nightmares that are in her resume. Here is the list:Clinton is promising expanded numbers of Syrian refugees brought to the United States, despite the fact that 99.1% of the 13,210 refugees admitted to the US in 2016 are Muslim and the FBI has said there is no way to adequately vet them for terrorist connections and sympathies.Our true national scandal is not that Clinton has so far escaped indictment, it is that so many of our civic and political institutions have been corrupted by a misguided loyalty to the Clinton crime syndicate.From the board rooms of Wall Street to the editorial boards of local newspapers and the town halls of the League of Women Voters, the defense of the  progressive cause  has come down to defending the indefensible  pay-for-play cronyism, open borders and national security breaches on a global scale.A full chronicle of Hillary Clinton s crimes will someday fill a large shelf of books, if not a whole library.There could be no better news for President Donald Trump in 2020, than the announcement that Hillary was going to throw her hat in the ring for the third time.

Hillary Clinton: Wall Street's favorite enemy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton began her presidential campaign by promising to do what it takes to rein in Wall Street. Boosted by Wall Streets toughest critics, U.S. senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic candidate has declared the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top and said she would raise bank fees and tighten banking regulations. She has encouraged regulators to break up too-risky banks. And yet, Wall Street appears unperturbed by the prospect of a Clinton presidency. In fact, the banking industry has supported Clinton with buckets of cash and stocks have sold off on days when the Clinton campaign stumbles. Privately, bankers say that they trust her to remain a pragmatist who will keep the current regulatory regime laid down by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform legislation passed in 2010. I dont think Clinton wakes up thinking about Wall Street, one senior banking industry lobbyist said. There are hints in apparently leaked email discussions among Clintons campaign staff that bankers are not far off the mark when they count on her to tread lightly.  Pressed during the campaign by progressive Democrats to call for a revival of the Glass-Steagall Act that would require separation of commercial and investment banking, Clinton ultimately refused. She also weighed another progressive favorite - a tax on financial transactions- but instead recommended a far narrower plan to tax only canceled orders by high speed traders. Ultimately, what bankers most like about Clinton is that she is not Donald Trump.  Many financiers fear her unorthodox Republican rival could disrupt global trade, damage geopolitical relationships and rattle markets, industry analysts and participants say. Those are the kind of things that corner offices think about, said Karen Shaw Petrou of Federal Financial Analytics Inc, whose firm advises financial firms about U.S. regulatory policy. The overriding concern about Trump has dominated peoples thinking. Trumps candidacy has upended traditional political alliances and bankers that usually contribute more to the Republicans have been flinging money at Clinton. Employees of the 17 largest bank holding companies and their subsidiaries have been sending her $10 for every $1 they contributed to Trump, according to a Reuters analysis. In 2012, the same group contributed twice as much to Republican candidate Mitt Romney as it did to President Barack Obamas re-election campaign.   People who work for hedge funds and private equity firms have contributed more than $56 million to Clintons presidential campaign and the supporting groups that face no legal cap on donations. Trumps campaign and related groups received just $243,000 from donors in the same sector, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. Its basically going with the devil you know over the devil you dont, said Brian Gardner, a managing director of New York investment firm Keefe Bruyette & Woods. What also helped, he said, was the familiarity with Hillary and Bill Clinton dating back to the 1990s when her husband was president and ushered in a period of financial deregulation. There is a closeness and a comfort level between the titans on Wall Street and the Clintons, he said. For bankers, the biggest worry is a scenario where Clinton wins and the Democrats take control of the House and the Senate, with progressives such as Warren and Sanders holding sway over everything from new tax laws to appointments of regulators. Already, Warren has called for immediate dismissal of the Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White. Last year, Warren successfully led a movement to derail Obamas plan to appoint banker Antonio Weiss to the top job at Treasury. Warren and other progressives will press Clinton to be tough on Wall Street in return for their campaign support.  Clinton leaned heavily on Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and progressive ideas, when she needed to excite voters, Adam Green with the Progressive Change Campaign Committee said. Elizabeth Warren has proven shes a very powerful ally to have on your side. And its well known shes also a formidable opponent to have against you, Green said.  However, recent polls suggest it is unlikely that Democrats will take the House and the future of the Senate is far from certain. Even if the Senate goes Democratic, it is likely to be led by New York Senator Chuck Schumer, a moderate who has represented Wall Street with the industrys backing. Clinton has said she will propose a risk fee on the largest financial firms and tighten up rules which allow banks to circumvent bans on proprietary trading by investing in hedge funds. Like Trump, she has proposed to end the tax break that private equity investors enjoy, termed carried interest. Yet such provisions will be probably tied up in a much larger tax initiative that will involve months, if not a year or more, of horse trading in Washington. Ultimately, it could end up overshadowed by other progressive goals, such as infrastructure funding, college affordability, or raising the minimum wage. Those are the causes that Clinton has prioritized and they are likely to supersede her anti-bank rhetoric, say bankers. One industry trade group representative said: Were not in her top 10 to take care of. ",1.0
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION: Teachers Should Incorporate Islam In More Subjects,"Does anyone in recent history remember the US Department of Education asking educators to place more emphasis on Christianity or Judaism in their curriculums? Yeah neither do we As parents across the country storm school board meetings over a perceived overemphasis on Islam in the curriculum, bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. are suggesting ways teachers can focus more on the religion.A recent blog posted to Home Room,  The official blog of the U.S. Department of Education,  points out that terrorist attacks in Paris and California sparked anti-Muslim incidents in schools and other places.Muslim students, and those perceived to be Muslim, could be bullied, and the government wants teachers to know how to  create an anti-bias learning environment  by focusing specifically on those students and their faith. This means incorporating the experiences, perspective and words of Muslim people into the curriculum through social studies and current events instruction, children s literature, in order to learn about different cultures,  the blog reads. When you teach about world religions, be sure to include Islam.   It s also important to be aware that some Muslim students may feel relieved and comfortable discussing these issues in class and others may feel nervous, scared or angry to be talking about a topic so close to home. The education experts   authors Jinnie Spiegler, director of curriculum with the Anti-Defamation League, and Sarah Sisaye of the Education Department s Office of Safe and Healthy Students   suggest that teachers pick controversial current events  ripe with examples of bias and injustice  to highlight anti-Muslim discrimination, and to  discuss what actions (students) could take to make a difference. Teachers should also take it upon themselves to spread awareness about  Muslim cultural traditions  by encouraging events like Hijab days, when female students wear the Islamic religious scarf donned by their Muslim classmates. The education experts provided a link to a YouTube video of an event at Vernon Hills High School in December as an example.Meanwhile, in places like Tennessee, state officials are reviewing curriculum early amid a barrage of complaints about questionable lessons on Islam in middle school history courses. Parents have highlighted lessons that required students to read, write and recite the Islamic conversion prayer; and pointed out the disproportionate amount of time students spend studying Islam versus other religions.Parents have also questioned the accuracy of texts that suggest Christians and Muslims worship the same God and that Islam is a  religion of peace,  EAGnews reports. A lot of the things we hear about Muhammad and a lot of the warfare that was waged is very much sugar coated,  Williamson County School Board member Susan Curlee said at a December town hall. My concern is, are we going to be asking students on a test to potentially compromise their faith for the sake of a grade?  she questioned.Also in December, parents in Greenville, Virginia raised objections to a world geography lesson at Riverheads High School that tasked students with copying the Islamic conversion prayer in Arabic, by hand. The intent, according to the lesson, is to  give you an idea of the artistic complexity of calligraphy,  The Shilling Show reports.The lesson doesn t appear to explain what the shahada or  Islamic statement of faith  is exactly    There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah    but it does discuss the inspiring beauty of the Koran.And it s those types of lessons that are sparking a backlash from parents across the country, from lawsuits in Maryland to proposed legislation in Tennessee, centered on what many view as Muslim  indoctrination  through curriculum.A bias toward Islam is one of the reasons Tyler County Board of Education President Bonnie Henthorn decided to homeschool her children, rather than allow them continue in public schools, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports.And while the Education Department blog stresses the importance of creating classrooms that are  free from discrimination and harassment based on protected traits   including religion,  it offers no suggestions for teachers struggling to explain to parents why government approved texts and associated lessons focus more on Islam than other religions.

U.S. Senate Democratic leader attacks Trump's health pick on ethics charge,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trumps choice to run the Department of Health and Human Services may have broken the law by making a stock purchase just before he introduced legislation that would have benefited the firm, the Senates leading Democrat charged on Tuesday. A confirmation hearing for Tom Price, a Republican congressman and orthopedic surgeon from Georgia, was scheduled for Wednesday before the Senate Health Committee. If confirmed, he would be a key player in carrying out Trumps plans to overhaul Democratic President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law. CNN reported on Sunday that Price bought between $1,001 and $15,000 worth of shares last March in Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc (ZBH.N), a medical device manufacturer. Days later, he introduced legislation in the House of Representatives that would have delayed a regulation that could have ultimately damaged the company, CNN said. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the leader of the Democratic minority in the Senate, called on the Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate whether Price had violated the 2012 Stock Act, a law designed to combat insider trading. Schumer said Prices Zimmer Biomet purchase may have been in violation of that law. It may be that this trade was illegal, Schumer said on the Senate floor on Tuesday afternoon. The Trump transition team said late on Monday that the stock purchase was directed not by Price but by a broker and that the congressman himself did not become aware of the stock buy until well after the legislation was introduced. The transition team urged CNN to retract the story. Any effort to connect the introduction of bipartisan legislation by Dr. Price to any campaign contribution is demonstrably false, said transition spokesman Phil Blando. Schumer did not sound convinced. Now they say theres a broker, its kind of strange that this broker would pick this stock totally independently of him introducing legislation thats so narrow and specific to this company, Schumer told CNN on Tuesday. Sean Spicer, who will serve as Trumps White House spokesman, defended Price. Regarding dem attacks on @RepTomPrice: this is a stock trade worth $300.  You couldnt get into a @SenSchumer fundraiser for that amount, Spicer said in a tweet. Another sign of trouble for Republicans in the healthcare arena emerged on Tuesday when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said a repeal of Obamacare - a top priority of both Trump and congressional Republicans - would increase the number of people without health insurance by 18 million in the first year. That number would grow to 32 million by the year 2026 and premiums would double in that time, the CBO said. The report based its analysis on a Republican repeal bill that was passed a year ago but vetoed by Obama. Republicans say the same bill is the blueprint for the repeal effort now under way in Congress. But House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, characterized the CBO projection as meaningless. He said it did not take into account measures under consideration to replace the law or actions that the incoming administration will take to revitalize the individual (insurance) market that has been decimated by Obamacare.   Price, an ardent advocate of Obamacare repeal, is one of eight Trump Cabinet nominees who will face Senate confirmation hearings this week. The hearings started on Tuesday with Ryan Zinke, a Republican congressman from Montana tapped for interior secretary, and Republican philanthropist Betsy DeVos, the nominee for education secretary. Trumps presidential inauguration is on Friday and his team is hoping to have as many of his nominees as possible, perhaps as many as seven, confirmed by then.  Price, however, will not be one of them. A second Senate panel, the Finance Committee, must also hold a hearing and a vote on Prices nomination, and it has not yet scheduled its hearing.  ",1.0
"Trump in TV event with Clinton, says Putin better leader than Obama","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump declared on Wednesday that Russias Vladimir Putin had been a better leader than U.S. President Barack Obama, as the Republican presidential nominee used a televised forum to argue he was best equipped to reassert Americas global leadership.  Trump suggested at the event in which he and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton made back-to-back appearances that U.S. generals had been stymied by the policies of Obama and Clinton, who served as the Democratic presidents first secretary of state. I think under the leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton the generals have been reduced to rubble. They have been reduced to a point thats embarrassing for our country, Trump said at NBCs Commander-in-Chief forum in New York attended by military veterans.  It was the first time Trump and Clinton had squared off on the same stage since accepting their parties presidential nominations in July for the Nov. 8 election. Clinton was grilled over her handling of classified information while using a private email server during her tenure at the State Department. FBI Director James Comey had declared her extremely careless in her handling of sensitive material but did not recommend charges against her. I did exactly what I should have done and I take it very seriously, always have, always will, she said.Trumps praise of Putin and his suggestion that the United States and Russia form an alliance to defeat Islamic State militants could raise eyebrows among foreign policy experts who feel Moscow is interfering with efforts to stem the Syrian civil war. If he says great things about me, Im going to say great things about him, Trump said of the Russian president. Certainly in that system, hes been a leader, far more than our president has been. Trump had called Obama the founder of ISIS, an acronym for Islamic State, in stump speeches several weeks ago. The statement drew broad criticism, prompting him to take a more disciplined approach to campaigning. He has since picked up ground on Clinton in national opinion polls. Trump also flirted with revealing what he had been learning in classified intelligence briefings given to him by U.S. officials because he is the Republican nominee. There was one thing that shocked me, Trump said. What I did learn is that our leadership, Barack Obama, did not follow what our experts ... said to do, and I was very, very surprised. ...Our leaders were not following what they recommended. Earlier on Wednesday, Trump pledged to launch a new U.S. military buildup, saying America was under threat like never before from foes like Islamist extremists, North Korea and China. The event offered a prelude to how Clinton and Trump will deal with questions on national security issues in their three upcoming presidential debates later in September and in October. Clinton began the forum saying her long experience in government as a U.S. senator and secretary of state made her uniquely qualified to serve as president. She said she had an absolute rock steadiness to be able to make tough decisions, a not so subtle dig at Trump, who Democrats say is temperamentally unfit for the White House. Moderator Matt Lauer doggedly pressed her about her handling of emails from a private server while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. The issue has raised questions about whether she can be trusted to serve as president. Clinton said none of the emails she sent or received were marked top secret, secret or classified, the usual way such material is identified.  Appearing in the second half of the hour-long show, Trump faced questions about his fitness for office. Asked if he would be prepared on Day One to be commander in chief, Trump said: One hundred percent. Trump quickly abandoned Lauers entreaties to avoid attacking his opponent and focus on what he would do if elected president in November. Shes been there for 30 years, Trump said. We need change, and we need it fast.  The event brought together the meticulously prepared Clinton, 68, the wife of former President Bill Clinton, and Trump, 70, a New York businessman whose brash, freewheeling style has allowed him to dominate the headlines during his campaign. Clinton said she regretted her decision as a U.S. senator from New York to vote in favor of the much-criticized 2003 Iraq war and that Trump had been in favor of it as well. Trump has condemned the war during his campaign and said he would avoid lengthy conflicts in the Middle East. On the U.S. intervention in Libya in 2011, Clinton rejected Trumps criticism of her support for the effort as secretary of state. Permitting there to be an ongoing civil war in Libya would be as threatening and as dangerous as what we are seeing in Syria, she said. Trump said Clintons handling of Libya proved disastrous. Republicans have made much of the fact that the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, was killed in an Islamist attack in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. She made a terrible mistake in Libya, said Trump. Clinton said U.S. policies under her leadership at the State Department had helped promote security. We made the world safer, she said. ",1.0
"AL SHARPTON CALLS For Less Legal Protection For Cops, More Federal (Obama) Involvement When Blacks Are Killed By Cops","How much longer before cops stop coming into the neighborhoods to help the people who hate them? The following is a statement from Ebonie Riley, Washington DC Bureau Chief of the National Action Network: We are disappointed in the decision of the court but unfortunately not surprised. As we have seen throughout the years, when officers opt for a trial by judge rather than by a jury, acquittal is the result. We have been through this with Sean Bell and far too many other cases in the past. This is exactly the reason we are calling for lowering the bar for federal prosecution, and greater involvement of the federal government in cases like this. In federal court, a jury trial cannot be waived without the consent of the prosecution   and we believe that is a fairer, more just process. We continue to stand with the Gray family as they fight for justice for their son.  Via: Weasel Zippers",0.0
U.S. imposes duties after finding seven producers dumped steel plate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Commerce made a final finding that seven foreign producers dumped certain carbon and alloy steel cut-to-length plate in the U.S. market, allowing it to impose duties ranging from 3.62 percent to 148 percent, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday. The determinations of dumping, or selling a product below its fair price, apply to imports of CTL plate from Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, Ross said. In addition, there was a final finding that South Korean imports were subsidized, leading to a countervailing duty of 4.31 percent being slapped on those products, he said at a department event. A healthy steel industry is critical to our economy and manufacturing base, yet our steel industry today is under assault from foreign producers that dump and subsidize their exports, Ross told the audience. In 2015, imports of CTL plate from the seven producers totaled $732 million, with those from Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea and Taiwan valued at an estimated $14.2 million, $19.8 million, $179 million, $196.2 million, $37 million, $54.9 million, $210 million and $21 million, respectively, department figures show. (bit.ly/2mSZM1Z) Cut-to-length steel is used in a wide range of applications, including buildings and bridgework; agricultural, construction and mining equipment; machine parts and tooling; ships, rail cars, tankers and barges; and large-diameter pipe. The finding followed an investigation prompted by a petition from Nucor Corp and U.S. subsidiaries of ArcelorMittal SA and SSAB AB. For Austrian producers and exporters, dumping duties on the Voestalpine group and all others were set at 53.72 percent. They were 5.4 percent for Industeel Belgium, 51.78 percent for the NLMK Belgium group and 5.4 percent for all other Belgium producers and exporters. Among French manufacturers and exporters, duty rates were set at 148.02 percent for Industeel France and 8.62 percent for Dillinger France and all others. In Germany, duties were set at 5.38 percent for AG der Dillinger Httenwerke, 22.90 percent for the Salzgitter group and 21.03 percent for all other exporters and producers. A spokesman for Salzgitter confirmed the company was facing duties, saying the decision to impose the duties and the level of them were incomprehensible.     In Italy, the department set anti-dumping duty rates of 6.08 percent for Officine Tecnosider, 22.19 percent for Marcegaglia SpA and NLMK Verona SpA and 6.08 percent for all other producers and exporters. Among Japanese producers and exporters, Tokyo Steel Manufacturing Co Ltd was hit with a duty rate of 14.79 percent. A rate of 48.67 percent was imposed on JFE Steel Corp and Shimabun Corp, and for all others it was set at 14.79 percent. Taiwanese companies Shang Chen Steel Co Ltd and China Steel Corp had anti-dumping duties of 3.62 percent and 6.95 percent, respectively, imposed on them. The rate for other producers and exporters was set at 5.29 percent. For South Korea, the department imposed an anti-dumping duty of 7.39 percent on POSCO, as well as a countervailing duty of 4.31 percent to account for subsidies. The same rates apply to all other producers and exporters. The findings allow the department to ask U.S. Customs authorities to collect cash deposits from exporters based on those rates. On March 3, in a decision stemming from the same investigation, the U.S. International Trade Commission said it had made a final finding that U.S. industry was being harmed by the dumping and subsidization of imports of carbon and alloy steel CTL plate from China. That allows for the final imposition of duties by the Commerce Department on Chinas producers and exporters of the plate. ",1.0
"Romney, potential U.S. secretary of state, hails Trump after dinner","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican Mitt Romney made an impassioned statement in support of President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday to try to erase doubts about him among Trumps supporters and remain in contention for U.S. secretary of state. Romney, a fierce critic of Trump during the Republican presidential primary battle, stopped short of an outright apology but his intention to wipe the slate clean was clear. The former Massachusetts governor, who was the Republican presidential nominee in 2012 and lost, praised Trump for a message of inclusion and bringing people together since his Nov. 8 victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Noting the appointments Trump has made to fill key cabinet positions for his administration and his desire for greater unity among Americans, Romney said that all of those things combined give me increasing hope that President-elect Trump is the very man who can lead us to a better future. Romney made his remarks after a lengthy meal with Trump and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus at a French restaurant at a Trump hotel in Manhattan. They dined on garlic soup with frog legs, scallops, steak and lamb chop. Since Trump began to seriously consider Romney as a potential secretary of state, some on Trumps team have voiced doubts about bringing in a former critic and rallied around their preferred candidate, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a long-time Trump friend and loyalist. Leading this effort in an unusually public way has been senior Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, who told a round of television interviews on Sunday that Trump supporters would feel betrayed if Romney was picked. Trump, however, has kept Romney in contention for the secretary of state position, and a Republican source close to the transition effort said Priebus has been pushing for Romney  behind the scenes. I had a wonderful evening with President-elect Trump, Romney said in remarks to reporters after the dinner. We had another discussion about affairs throughout the world and these discussions Ive had with him have been enlightening, andinteresting, and engaging. Ive enjoyed them very, very much. A senior Trump aide described Romneys remarks as solid. Trump is to meet on Friday for the second time with retired Marine Corps General John Kelly as part of his secretary of state search, the aide said. Trump is also considering U.S. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Corker met Trump at Trump Tower earlier on Tuesday and told reporters afterward that Trump needs to choose someone that hes very comfortable with and he knows theres going be no daylight between him and them. The world needs to know that the secretary of state is someone who speaks fully for the president and again, thats a decision hes going to have to make, Corker said. ",1.0
Venezuela frees two anti-Maduro activists; scores still jailed,"CARACAS, Venezuela (Reuters) - Venezuelan authorities overnight freed two activists who were in jail for more than a year after being accused of plotting against socialist President Nicolas Maduro, the opposition said on Saturday. Delson Guarate, who had been a mayor in central Aragua state, and former student leader Yon Goicoechea were among nearly 400 jailed anti-Maduro activists who rights campaigners say are political prisoners but whom the government calls coup-plotters.  I m with my family today,  tweeted Goicoechea, displaying a photo of himself against the backdrop of Caracas  Avila mountain.  Tomorrow I ll address the country. God is with us.    I m free!  Guarate tweeted. The pair s freedom, with some unspecified conditions attached, was confirmed by opposition parties and a rights group, but the government had no comment.  The releases came as Maduro called for one of the most prominent opposition leaders, congress head Julio Borges, to face treason charges for lobbying against his government in global financial circles. And the pro-Maduro Supreme Court began moves this week to remove parliamentary immunity for congress deputy leader Freddy Guevara, so he can be tried for instigating violence.  Guevara runs the militant Popular Will party, which both Goicoechea and Guarate belong to. It has been at the forefront of anti-Maduro protests, including four months of demonstrations this year that led to 125 deaths.  Critics say Maduro has turned the OPEC nation into a dictatorship. His supporters say the 54-year-old successor to Hugo Chavez is resisting a Western-backed push to oust him. In a New York Times column earlier this year, Goicoechea described how a dozen policemen put a black cloth over his head when they arrested him before taking him to a cell without natural light or ventilation.   When I stretched my arms, I could touch two opposite walls,  he wrote in the column smuggled out of prison.  The door was blocked with black garbage bags, leaving the room in total darkness.   There was rotten, worm-infested food on the floor alongside scraps of clothing covered in feces. It felt as if I had been buried alive.     Senior officials said Goicoechea was an  imperialist  agent caught with explosives in his possession, while Guarate had been financing  terrorism.  Neither was tried. Popular Will, which the government has threatened to proscribe as a terrorist organization, said it would not stop fighting for the freedom of all activists.  The dictatorship s  justice  is a revolving door,  said party legislator Juan Mejia.  Some leave, while others come in at its discretion and to its benefit.  ",1.0

Trump says waterboarding 'works' but will defer to Cabinet: ABC interview,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, asked about the practice of waterboarding as an intelligence-gathering tool, said: Absolutely I feel it works, but added he would defer to his Cabinet on whether to use it. Trump told ABC in an interview to be broadcast later on Wednesday he would rely on the advice of CIA Director Mike Pompeo and U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis, among others, about using the illegal technique. And if they dont want to do it, thats fine. If they do want to do it then I will work toward that end. I want to do everything within the bounds of what were allowed to do if its legal ... Do I feel it works? Absolutely I feel it works. Trumps predecessor, Barack Obama, signed an executive order in 2009 banning waterboarding - a form of simulated drowning - and other Enhanced Interrogation Techniques, which are denounced by many lawmakers and rights groups as torture.

 Notorious RBG Throws AMAZING Shade At Trump From SCOTUS Bench (VIDEO),"We love Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She s the sweet   but also sharp   liberal justice who sits on the Supreme Court. She s also no fan of Donald Trump. One tradition that Ginsburg   AKA The Notorious RBG   has is wearing a special  dissent  collar when she is going against major rulings presented the land s highest court. No such ruling was upon the justices today, but Ginsburg wore the collar anyway. It seemed to be her way of showing the nation and world that she disapproves of a Donald Trump presidency.Now, this fact is no secret; after all, America s favorite SCOTUS justice came under fire during the heated presidential campaign for remarks she made about the bombastic then-GOP presidential nominee. She said: He is a faker. He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego.   How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? The press seems to be very gentle with him on that. Ginsburg then went on to lament the idea of what a Trump presidency will do to our American reality, saying: For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be   I don t even want to contemplate that. Well, unfortunately, that is now our reality. I have to wonder what is going through Justice Ginsburg s head right about now.

 Adviser Who Oversaw Obamas Infrastructure Plan Blows IMMENSE Hole In Trumps Plan,"One of Trump s biggest campaign promises was to create jobs, and right now his plan is a massive, trillion-dollar infrastructure program. Sounds fantastic, right? Sure, it ll cost money, but it ll mean thousands of jobs and we get our crumbling infrastructure back into shape. Sweet!Or not, says former Obama adviser Ron Klain. Those trillions won t be poured directly into projects   they ll go to investors who then may or may not back needed infrastructure projects. Klain oversaw the implementation of President Obama s  Recovery Act  of 2009 and knows a thing or two about this, and he believes Trump s plan is actually a massive trap: Trump s plan provides tax breaks to private-sector investors who back profitable construction projects. These projects (such as electrical grid modernization or energy pipeline expansion) might already be planned or even underway. There s no requirement that the tax breaks be used for incremental or otherwise expanded construction efforts; they could all go just to fatten the pockets of investors in previously planned projects. How bloody fantastic   more tax cuts for the rich. In other words, the plan may or may not create jobs for Americans. It may or may not actually give us the influx of dollars we need to repair our decaying infrastructure. It s a very pretty Mardi Gras mask placed over what s basically more government welfare for the rich and powerful.In fact, Klain points out that there s no guarantee that this will create jobs because there s no requirement that those dollars go to unfunded projects. He also says that it s not likely to go to projects that aren t profitable for investors, such as expanding and rebuilding water grids or repairing existing roads and bridges.These investors could see up to $85 billion apiece with which they have to do nothing. Without the necessary strings, those trillion dollars will effectively be flushed down the toilet while rich investors make themselves richer.And Democrats jumping on board with this plan are busy collecting their 30 pieces of silver. According to Klain, it didn t go so well for them when they backed either Ronald Reagan s or George W. Bush s tax cut plans because ultimately, those plans increased inequality and blew holes in the federal budget. Democrats sold themselves out on those plans, though, and they re selling out again on this one.Worse, though, Trump s infrastructure plan could actually open the door to Republicans who want to weaken things like wage protection and union representation for construction workers. Both of these will badly harm Americans, including, and perhaps especially, the white working class.Democrats are taking a lot of heat over an idea that they needed to focus far more heavily on white, rural America during the election, and some Democrats have jumped on the Trump train s infrastructure ideas and are calling it a  jobs plan.  Except it s not, and it will probably hurt the working class even more. At the bare minimum, it won t help them, and then they ll blame Democrats for it because reasons.They ll blame Democrats if Trump s infrastructure plan doesn t go through, too. In other words, Democrats can t win for losing, even though Trump is the cartoon villain who deserves to have this land squarely on his head like a piano or a giant anvil.Trump s setting us up for a trillion dollar failure. All he and the Republicans care about are enriching the already rich. Klain is right. This is a trap, and we need to beware.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",0.0

Nevermind the fact that this has never been proposed by anyone who likes the idea of legalized paths to citizenship   it s just plain stupid. The only plan for Trump right now is to promote pure, unabashed hatred toward anyone not straight, white, male, and Christian.

 Trump Has Extremely Inappropriate Reaction To Being Contradicted By His Own National Security Adviser,"The majority of America has already noticed   and figured it out a long time ago   that Donald Trump doesn t have a measured, steady reaction to anything. Widely known for his lack of mental and emotional stability, America s new failing president continues to horrify the nation (and the world) with his over-the-top, inappropriate reactions to even the most straightforward issues and disagreements. How Trump treats members of his own team is a perfect example of this.Last month, Trump made a controversial remark when he insisted that South Korea should pay for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), a missile defense system that would help keep North Korea at bay. As Trump frequently talks out of his a** and makes statements that have no basis in reality, he was quickly contradicted by his own National Security Adviser, H.R. McMaster. In a public statement, McMaster stepped in and quickly assured the Korean government that the cost of THAAD would be taken care of by the United States. Apparently, Trump didn t take that too well.According to Bloomberg, it s just been revealed that Trump lost his sh*t over this and tore his own adviser a new one over the phone. Bloomberg reported: Trump was livid, according to three White House officials, after reading in the Wall Street Journal that McMaster had called his South Korean counterpart to assure him that the president s threat to make that country pay for a new missile defense system was not official policy. These officials say Trump screamed at McMaster on a phone call, accusing him of undercutting efforts to get South Korea to pay its fair share. Trump, as usual, was having a highly inappropriate reaction to his fragile ego being bruised. Apparently, this isn t even the first and only time something like this has happened. Bloomberg stated that in private, Trump calls McMaster the general undermining my policy  and appears regretful that he appointed him.The lack of trust and in-fighting we ve seen in the Trump administration   as well as Trump s lack of respect for the advisers HE appointed   is unprecedented on so many levels. This administration continues to be an embarrassment to this country, and most of us can t wait until this nightmare is over.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images",0.0

TWISTED LIBERAL KINDERGARTEN Teacher Allows Transgender Student To REVEAL Her TRUE GENDER To Class,"Silly parents you don t get to decide if, or when to talk to your kids about the .03% of the population who consider themselves to be  transgender.  And oh yeah your kids teacher will also inform your child that the gender they re born with doesn t matter, and that they can actually choose the gender they identify with.  Because liberal educators know better than you what s best for your child.The Rocklin Academy school board is facing tough questions from parents concerned over a controversial incident involving transgender discussions inside a kindergarten class. These parents feel betrayed by the school district that they were not notified,  said Karen England with the Capitol Resource Institute.WATCH:The incident happened earlier this summer during the last few days of the academic school year.At Monday night s board meeting, the teacher at the center of the controversy spoke out. With emotions high, she addressed a packed house. I m so proud of my students, it was never my intent to harm any students but to help them through a difficult situation,  she said.The teacher defended her actions to read two children s books about transgenderism including one titled  I am Jazz.  She says the books were given to her by a transgender child going through a transition. The kindergartners came home very confused, about whether or not you can pick your gender, whether or not they really were a boy or a girl,  said England.And many parents say they feel betrayed and blindsided. I want her to hear from me as a parent what her gender identity means to her and our family, not from a book that may be controversial,  a parent said. My daughter came home crying and shaking so afraid she could turn into a boy,  another parent said.The issue was not on the agenda, so parents spoke out during public comment. It s really about the parents being informed and involved and giving us the choice and rights of what s being introduced to our kids, and at what age,  said parent Chelsea McQuistan.Many teachers also spoke out in support of what transpired inside the classroom. They spoke about the importance of teaching students about diversity and having healthy dialogues.Unlike sex education, the topics of gender identity don t require prior parental notice.

Pope says humanity will 'go down' if it does not address climate change,"ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (Reuters) - Pope Francis said the recent spate of hurricanes should prompt people to understand that humanity will  go down  if it does not address climate change and history will judge those who deny the science on its causes.  If we don t turn back, we will go down,  Francis told reporters on Sunday on the plane returning from Colombia. Francis strongly backed the 2015 Paris agreement on reducing global warming, from which the United States withdrew this year. Francis spoke as hurricane Irma pounded central Florida as it carved through the state with high winds, storm surges and torrential rains that left millions without power, ripped roofs off homes and flooded city streets. Francis was asked about recent hurricanes, including Irma and Harvey, and if political leaders who do not want to work with other countries to stem global warming should be held morally responsible for future effects on the planet.  You can see the effects of climate change and scientists have clearly said what path we have to follow,  he said, referring to a consensus by scientists that global warming is caused by human activity such as fossil fuels.  All of us have a responsibility, all of us, small or large, a moral responsibility. We have to take it seriously. We can t joke about it,  he said.  Each person has their own. Even politicians have their own.  Ahead of the Paris summit in 2015, Francis wrote a major encyclical, or papal letter, on the care of the environment which backed the gradual elimination of fossil fuels to stem global warming. The accord, agreed on by nearly 200 countries, aims to cut emissions blamed for global warming. The United States committed to reducing its own by 26 to 28 percent, compared with 2005 levels, by 2025. Many world leaders criticized Trump for pulling out.  If someone is doubtful that this is true, they should ask scientists. They are very clear. These are not opinions made on the fly.  They are very clear. Then each person can decide and history will judge the decisions,  he said. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris agreement shortly after visiting the Vatican in May. The Vatican had urged him to stay in the accord. A Vatican official said at the time that the U.S. move was a  slap in the face  for the pope and the Vatican. ",1.0

Kremlin says U.S. tip-off about planned attack 'saved many lives',"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A U.S. tip-off about a planned attack in St. Petersburg helped save many lives and Russia and the United States should try to cooperate in the same way in future, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday. Washington provided intelligence to Russia that helped thwart a potentially deadly bombing, U.S. and Russian officials said on Sunday, in a rare public show of cooperation despite deep strains between the two countries.  It cannot be called anything but an ideal example of cooperation in fighting terrorism,  Peskov told reporters at a conference call.  We should aim for such standards.  The tip-off resulted in the detention of seven alleged supporters of the Islamic State militant group in St. Petersburg last week, Peskov said. Russia s Federal Security Service said on Friday that IS had planned attacks in public places on Dec. 16 and weapons and explosives were found when the suspects were searched. Peskov said Russian and American security services have contacts but this was the first time when their cooperation was so efficient.  This was very meaningful information that helped to save many lives,  the spokesman told reporters. Asked if President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin had discussed a possible meeting, Peskov replied that the issue  had not been brought up yet . ",1.0
 Donna Brazile DESTROYS Palin For Blaming Her Woman-Beating Sons Arrest On Obama (VIDEO),"Sarah Palin did something entirely expected of her, yet so irrationally stupid that it is almost baffling following the arrest of her son for drunkenly beating his girlfriend and making threats with a semiautomatic weapon: She found a way to blame President Obama.At a Trump rally, where nonsensical bullshit is accepted as fact without question by the vapid, racist buffoons that make up the billionaire s base, Palin said that PTSD and Obama were the true culprits in her son s woman-brutalizing, ammosexual ways: I can talk personally about this, I guess it s kind of the elephant in the room. My son like so many others, they come back a bit different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is that respect for what it is that their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military so sacrificially have given to this country. And that starts from the top. It s a shame that our military personnel even have to wonder, if they have to question, if they re respected anymore. It starts from the top. The question though that comes from our own president where they have to look at him and wonder, do you know what we go through? Do you know what we re trying to do to secure America and to secure the freedoms that have been bequeathed us? I can certainly relate with other families who kind of feel these ramifications of some PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with,  Palin said.  And it makes me realize more than ever it is now or never for the sake of Americas finest that we have that commander in chief that will respect them and honor them. Track Palin served with the Alaska-based 25th Infantry Division s 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team for a single year in 2008, while George W. Bush was still President.Palin s nonsensical claim didn t sit well with veterans   or with CNN political commentator Donna Brazile, who put Palin on blast Wednesday. You have known me for a long time, so I m just gonna say it: she s a liar,  Brazile told Anderson Cooper.  That s a damn lie.  She pointed out that House Republicans slashed $1.4 billion (with a  b ) from President Obama s requested budget for veterans  services, which included a $690 million reduction  for medical care   the sort of thing that would help veterans with PTSD: I care for all veterans   I am the daughter of a veteran. And to go out there and to insinuate that the president of the United States is trying to hurt veterans when in fact he is trying to put more resources so that we can give our young and old veterans the care we need, that s just a damn lie. You can say Donna Brazile said it. I approve this message. Of course [Track Palin] should be held responsible for his own personal behavior,  Trump supporter Jeffrey Lord contended when asked if Palin was right to blame Obama.  But we have been told time and time and time again that there is a serious problem within the VA treating veterans. And I think that s the point she s trying to make.  He did not explain how in the world blaming Obama brought attention to any issues with the VA. Drink the water, Jeff,  Brazile shot back.  Drink the water.

U.S.-led surveillance aircraft leave area near Islamic State convoy in Syria,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State said on Friday its surveillance aircraft had moved away from an Islamic State convoy which has been trying to reach territory in east Syria. The Islamic State convoy has split in two, with 11 buses remaining in the open desert after others turned back into government-held areas. The Syrian government and Lebanon s Hezbollah group offered the convoy of originally about 300 lightly armed Islamic State fighters and about 300 family members safe passage in return for the militant group surrendering an enclave on the Syria-Lebanon border. However, the coalition has blocked the convoy from entering Islamic State territory in east Syria, near the border with Iraq, by cratering roads and destroying bridges.  To ensure safe de-confliction of efforts to defeat ISIS, coalition surveillance aircraft departed the adjacent airspace at the request of Russian officials during their assault on Dawyr Az Zawyr,  the coalition said in the Friday statement, using an acronym for Islamic State. The coalition said Syrian pro-regime forces had  advanced past  the convoy.  The regime s advance past the convoy underlines continued Syrian responsibility for the buses and terrorists,  Brigadier General Jon Braga, director of operations for the coalition said. ",1.0
WHY MODERATE MUSLIMS DONT SPEAK OUT: Muslim Shopkeeper Makes Video Wishing Customers Happy EasterMuslim Man Stabs Him To Death [VIDEO],"The religion of peace and tolerance strikes again A shopkeeper was murdered by a fellow Muslim after he wished his Christian friends a peaceful Easter.Asad Shah, who was stabbed up to 30 times at his shop, had praised both the life of Jesus and  his beloved Christian nation . Left lying in a pool of blood, the 40-year-old died in hospital. Police, who were questioning a 32-year-old suspect last night, said the killing was religiously motivated.Mohammad Faisal, a family friend, said a bearded Muslim wearing a long religious robe entered Mr Shah s shop and spoke to him in his native language before stabbing him in the head with a kitchen knife.Mr Shah s brother, who was working next door, rushed out to find the killer laughing while sitting on the Glasgow newsagent s bleeding chest. The brother dragged Mr. Shah away but the guy continued attacking with the blade,  said Mr Faisal.  They struggled up to the bus stop where Asad collapsed. It was just a clear-cut revenge attack. For posting messages about peace, messages about greeting fellow Christians and Jews. Here is the video Asad Shah posted that inspired his brutal murder by a fellow Muslim: Before his death, Mr Shah had wished his friends a  Good Friday and a very happy Easter, especially to my beloved Christian nation .In his final post, he wrote:  Let s follow the real footstep of beloved holy Jesus Christ and get the real success in both worlds.

 Disrespectful Prick Ted Cruz Will Snub President Obama By Skipping Final State Of The Union Address,"Instead of respectfully attending President Obama s final State of the Union Address like other Republican nominees, Ted Cruz is skipping it.The Texas Tea Party Senator made the decision to campaign in New Hampshire on January 12th rather than spending a couple hours respectfully listening to what our current commander-in-chief has to say during one of his last major speeches as president.Of course, it s not like Cruz couldn t fly in and fly back out after the speech is over, which is why this definitely feels like a snub of President Obama, especially when you consider that Senators Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, and Bernie Sanders are all putting their campaigns on pause for the evening to hear what President Obama has to say.But Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler insists that this isn t a snub at all. Cruz is simply working hard to win New Hampshire, he says, even though Cruz is in third place in the Granite State 16-points behind leader Donald Trump. It s not a snub. He s going to be in New Hampshire, working hard to win New Hampshire. No disrespect. It just is going to work out this way. Tyler also added that Cruz will be be  disappointed  with the speech no matter where he is at the time it is delivered.  It won t matter because he ll be just as disappointed in New Hampshire as he will be in the chamber,  he said.Adding further insult and disrespect toward President Obama, Cruz intends to hold his own State of the Union hours before the real one in what the Dallas Morning News reports is being billed as the  State of Our Union Town Hall Meeting with Senator Ted Cruz. Basically, Cruz is snubbing the State of the Union Address to run off and pretend he is already president.And his disrespectful actions could come back to haunt him come Election Day in November.James Madison University professor of media and politics Dan Schill told The Hill that while Cruz s stunt won t necessarily harm him among Republican primary voters who already cheer anybody who disrespects President Obama, it may cost him voters who see this as being disrespectful. I don t think it will necessarily turn off too many primary voters in New Hampshire and Iowa, but there is that risk,  he said.  The choice to stiff the speech can send a message it s time for change. It may also backfire for people who see it as not respecting office of the presidency. In short, Ted Cruz is being a disrespectful little prick who believes he can fire up New Hampshire Republicans to vote for him if he snubs President Obama.It s one thing to dislike the man who is president, but disrespecting the office is totally unacceptable and proves once again that Ted Cruz isn t qualified to be president, whether he is a natural born citizen or not.Featured Image: Wikimedia",0.0

WHY DID HARRY REID LIE ABOUT THE ACCIDENT He Had That Left Him Blind In One Eye?,"Dirty Harry must ve jarred something in his head that makes him unaware that he s lying in public. He used to be pretty good at hiding it Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) is changing the story about how he sustained those gruesome New Year s Day injuries that have left him blind in one eye.Previously, Reid claimed that an exercise band he was using  broke. I was doing exercises that I ve been doing for many years with those large rubber bands and one of them broke and spun me around and I crashed into these cabinets and injured my eye,  (emphasis added) Reid said at a press conference on January 22.(You can see the video of that press conference here.)But now, in an interview conducted by Fusion (a joint venture between ABC and Univision), excerpts of which have been released today, Reid tells Univision anchor Jorge Ramos that the exercise band  slipped,  rather than  broke. [T]he [elastic band] strap had no handle on it, slipped, spun me around, uh, about, oh I guess four feet (Reid points with his right hand to the wall of the interview room) and so I smashed my face into a cabinet,  Reid tells Ramos.Reid s latest version of the incident, as told to Ramos, differs from previous versions advanced by his team in another very significant way. Sources familiar with the incident said Reid was exercising in his bathroom, with the exercise band attached to the shower door,  Politico reported on January 22. (emphasis added)As Breitbart News reported previously, that version of the story, almost certainly told to Politico by Reid s staffers with his approval, is not credible.Now, however, Reid tells Ramos a different story. The exercise band was not attached to the shower door in his bathroom, Reid says, but was instead attached to  a big metal hook that came out from the wall  in an unspecified room in his new Nevada home.Here s a partial transcript of the excerpt of the interview released by Fusion:Ramos: You said recently that the accident had nothing to do with your decision to retire.However, we are seeing the consequences of what happened.What really happened?Was it really with an elastic band?Reid: Yeah, I had a big, that thick (Reid gestures with his hands), that I had been using for about four years and I was, you know, trying to maintain my, uh, firmness, and, uh, that was my weight training. I was doing that in my new home here in Nevada and a big metal hook that came out from the wall that was hooked there that the strap had no handle on it, slipped, spun me around, uh, about, oh I guess four feet (Reid points with his right hand to the wall of the interview room) and so I smashed my face into a cabinet so hard that uh Ramos: It looked like somebody had hit you.Reid: I am so fortunate that, um, it wasn t over just a fraction of this way and hit me in the temple.Ramos: How s your eye?Reid: I am sightless in my right eye.Watch the full video of the excerpts of the Fusion interview here:Ramos then switched gears and asked Reid about  the most difficult moments of [his] 28 years in the Senate. Ramos failed to ask some key follow up questions about Reid s New Year s Day injury incident.For instance, Ramos failed to ask Reid if the accident took place in his bathroom, as Reid s office had previously claimed. According to Reid s latest version of the story, we do not know in which room of his house he now claims he sustained these injuries.Breitbart News has asked Senator Reid s office, which has carefully controlled the release of information about his New Year s Day injuries, to comment on his changed version of the story of his New Year s Day injuries, but has received no reply.Via: Breitbart News",0.0
Trump commerce nominee Ross to tell senators: 'I am not anti-trade',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trumps nominee for U.S. commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, will tell senators on Wednesday he is not anti-trade but that the United States should not put up with malicious practices or unfair subsidies from foreign trading partners. I am not anti-trade. I am pro-trade. But I am pro-sensible trade, not trade that is detrimental to the American worker and to the domestic manufacturing base, Ross said in a prepared testimony to the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee that was seen by Reuters. The 79-year-old billionaire investor said in his prepared opening statement that his wide-ranging investments had given him first-hand experience of the unfair trading practices of other countries, including non-tariff barriers to imports and government subsidies for exports to the United States. I think Ive probably had more direct experience than any prior Cabinet nominee has had with unfair trade in the steel business, in the textile business, in the auto parts business and other sectors, Ross said. I am very well aware of the issues many companies face, and Im sensitive to both the issues abroad and the issues here at home. Trump has voiced a hard line on trade with China and Mexico, saying major changes are needed to reduce their chronic trade surpluses with the United States. He has threatened to declare China a currency manipulator and levy tariffs on Chinese and Mexican goods, but little is known about his specific plans. Ross, who has been designated the leader of Trumps trade strategy, will tell the committee that countries should have access to the U.S. market if they agree to play by our standards of fair trade. We should not put up with malicious trading activities, state-owned enterprises or subsidized production, he said, without naming any specific countries. Like Trump, the outgoing Obama administration has been critical of Chinas subsidies for state-owned enterprises and its failure to reduce its industrial overcapacity, filing a complaint with the World Trade Organization over Chinese aluminum sector subsidies  last week. Ross will also say he was struck in recent meetings with technology executives by how similar their trade problems were to those faced by the more traditional industries in which he has worked. Ross disclosed earlier on Tuesday that he would sell investments valued at up to about $300 million, including his stake in his private equity firm, in order to avoid conflicts of interest as commerce secretary, a position with responsibilities ranging from trade enforcement and economic data production to  telecommunications auctions and weather forecasting.  Reuters also reported that companies run by Ross had shifted some 2,700 U.S. jobs to other countries since 2004, according to Labor Department data.             ",1.0
"U.S., Canada put pipeline fight in the past with state dinner","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is eager to turn the page on the years-long fight over a crude oil pipeline with Canada and celebrate its close economic and security ties with its northern neighbor, U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said on Wednesday. Trade between the United States and Canada and joint efforts to curb climate change will loom large on the agenda for the meeting between President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Washington on Thursday. It will be followed by a star-studded state dinner meant to recognize the importance of the bilateral relationship, the first state dinner to honor Canada in 19 years. Trudeaus Liberals came to power in November by ousting right-wing Conservative leader Stephen Harper, whose ties with Washington deteriorated as he hectored Obama over the Keystone XL pipeline. President Barack Obama blocked the project last year, a victory for environmentalists who had campaigned against the pipeline. The spat is in the past, Rice said. In any bilateral relationship, there are going to be issues of difference and occasional friction, she told Reuters in an interview.  The complexity and the breadth and the depth of the U.S-Canada relationship is such that no single issue can overshadow the totality of the relationship, she said. Obama and Trudeau will discuss the next steps for the Beyond the Border initiative, a plan to speed travel and trade, Rice said. With the longest peaceful border and $2 billion a day in trade in both directions, we have an enormous shared stake in a border that is open for business and open for travel - and safe, Rice said. Trudeau campaigned to strengthen ties with the United States, but also promised he would pull out six fighter jets from the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Rice said the White House is satisfied with steps that Trudeau took to beef up training, surveillance and other support to the coalition. Taken as a whole, we view the Canadian stepped-up contribution to the counter-ISIL campaign as being very, very valuable and welcome, Rice said, using an acronym for Islamic State. The White House has also watched closely as Trudeau welcomed 25,000 Syrian refugees to Canada in four months. Weve seen thus far that Canada is taking very seriously its responsibility to its own citizens and to our common security to be vigilant as it welcomes these new refugees, Rice said.     ",1.0
HILLARY ALINSKY IS NEXT: How POPULIST Movement Is Catching Fire WorldwideGLOBALIST Movement Is On The Run [VIDEO]," It s always the will of the people ultimately that wins out    Trump The vote to Brexit a hard-fought campaign by nationalist populists in the United Kingdom puts the world elite on their heels, as a similar but bigger and stronger such movement is brewing right here in the United States.Donald J. Trump, the presumptive 2016 GOP presidential nominee, has run a campaign so far and since winning the nomination focused squarely on the exact same issues that the Leave campaigners ran on in the United Kingdom. Uncontrolled migration, out-of-whack trade deals, national sovereignty, popular control of government, and rejection of world elites are what propelled Leave campaigners to a stunning victory in the United Kingdom. Those same issues are what has propelled Trump to a similarly shocking victory over 16 other Republican presidential candidates in the primaries, where he as Breitbart News has documented received millions more votes than anyone else who has ever won the GOP nomination has.They also set the stage for the 2016 general election. Trump has not shown a sign of backing down at all, on any of this, and in his speech earlier in the week laying out the case against Hillary Rodham Clinton the presumptive 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, his opponent in November he set the stage for this battle.Here s Trump on the UK Brexit: Everywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be. But we can t solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them,  Trump said in his Tuesday address.  We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place. The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money. Throughout the speech, Trump excoriated Clinton for her ties to the world s international elite citing Peter Schweizer s Clinton Cash to detail how she and her husband, former U.S. President Bill Clinton,  used the State Department to enrich their family at America s expense. She gets rich making you poor,  Trump said of Hillary Clinton, talking directly to the voters.The matching themes of Trump s campaign, and the successful Brexit campaign in the United Kingdom, are in large part why Trump s well-timed trip to Scotland purportedly for opening a golf course with his children, but seemingly because of the Leave success makes him the captain of an international populist rejection of the world s elite.Trump seized the mantle of the movement on Friday morning in Scotland, embracing the populism that has propelled him this far and sustained him even as the most sinister and brutal of attacks come his way from inside his own party and from the other side. This is an amazing honor,  Trump said on Friday, almost taking credit for Brexit. After noting Brexit won, and by a bigger margin than pundits, analysts, and prognosticators could have ever predicted, Trump noted that the will of the public is all powerful. It s always the will of the people ultimately that wins out,  Trump said. Via: Breitbart NewsTrump was on the RIGHT side yet again. He supported the Brexit from the get-go: ",0.0
JUST IN: Criminal Hackers Who Stole Data From 500 MILLION Yahoo Email Users Were RUSSIAN Agents Obama Regime INVITED To U.SCourted By FBI,"Just two years ago, the Obama White House welcomed Russia s top internal security official, Alexander Bortnikov, to Washington, as the head of a Kremlin delegation attending a highly publicized U.S. government summit on countering violent extremism.Obama was caught on an open mic telling Russian President Dmitry Medvedev (on the left) who is pictured toasting with Vladimir Putin and Head of the Federal Security Service Alexander Bortnikov, that he would  have more flexibility  after his second term. Of course, the mainstream media all but ignored the disturbing conversation. They re all over the fake news story however about Trump and his alleged Russian ties, of which they have absolutely NO evidence. What U.S. officials did not then know is that officers of the agency that Bortnikov heads, the FSB or Federal Security Service, were at that moment directing an audacious state-sponsored cyberattack to penetrate Yahoo s email network, deploying criminal hackers to steal data on 500 million email users, according to criminal charges unveiled by the Justice Department on Wednesday. The indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in California charged two FSB officers and two civilians   one Russian and one from Kazakhstan, now living in Canada   with crimes including computer hacking and economic espionage.The FSB sponsored cyberattack, which lasted from 2014 to last September, was described by government officials today as one of the largest data breaches in history: It involved the theft of vast amounts of credit card data and other financial information, as well as personal details on individuals of high interest to the Russian government: journalists, U.S. officials and U.S. and foreign corporate executives and employees, including a senior officer of a major U.S. airline and even a Nevada gaming official.But what was especially galling to U.S. officials is that the two FSB officers at the center of the plot, Dmitry Dokuchaev and Igor Sushchin, were assigned to the agency s Center for Information Security, or Center 18   a cybercrime unit that was the FBI s point of contact for investigating criminal hacking operations. What this shows is that we ve been had,  said Steve Hall, a former CIA station chief in Moscow who later directed agency operations in Russia.  Center 18 was the part of the FSB that was supposed to be working with us. But instead of working with the FBI and CIA to catch hackers, the FSB officers were actually working with hackers themselves, according to the Justice Department charges. In the Yahoo attack, two alleged cybercriminals were also charged as co-conspirators in the plot. One of them, Alexsey Belan, a notorious cyberthief who has been twice indicted in the United States and is on the FBI s  Cyber Most Wanted  list, received  sensitive  law enforcement and intelligence information from the FSB that helped him avoid detection by the FBI and facilitated his theft of proprietary Yahoo data   including stealing the company s Account Management Tool (AMT), a system that Yahoo used to make and log changes to user accounts. His purpose, a senior U.S. official said today, was to  line his own pockets with money. For entire story: Yahoo News",0.0

Cuba holds municipal elections on road to Castro eras end,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba took another step on Sunday toward the end of the Castro era, with millions of residents placing paper ballots in cardboard boxes for ward delegates to municipal assemblies. The vote comes the day after the first anniversary of revolutionary leader Fidel Castro s death and precedes another election early next year for provincial and national assembly deputies. The new national assembly, where 50 percent of the deputies must be ward delegates elected on Sunday, is expected on Feb. 24 to select a new president to replace Raul Castro, Fidel s 86-year-old younger brother, who has said he will step down after serving two five-year terms. The Castro brothers have headed the government since the 1959 revolution. Raul Castro will remain head of the Communist Party until 2021, the only legal party in Cuba. Nearly 27,000 candidates are running for 12,515 ward positions in Sunday s election, the only part of the electoral process that is contested publicly and with direct participation by ordinary Cubans. The results will be announced on Monday. The candidates for the provincial and national assemblies are nominated by commissions composed of representatives of Communist Party-controlled organizations, such as the trade union federation, then presented as a slate for a public vote. Those slates have had the same number of names as seats in previous elections. Fifty percent of those names must be ward delegates. The electoral cycle comes at a tricky time for the Caribbean nation as the revolutionary generation passes, an economic reform program appears stalled, aid from key ally Venezuela shrinks, and the Trump administration threatens. Yet candidates debated none of these issues before Sunday s vote. First Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who is expected to succeed Castro, lauded the electoral process and refused to speculate about his future.  Today is a day to talk about what we are doing and Fidel,  he told reporters after casting his ballot. Asked about relations with the United States, he said Cuba remained interested in improving them, but reiterated its position that negotiations would have to be based on mutual respect and equality and without dictates.  The future depends on them, not us,  he said. Campaigning is prohibited in Cuba, and candidates for the ward posts were nominated at neighborhood meetings based on their personal merits, not policy positions. They need not belong to the Communist Party, and many candidates are independents, but only a few government opponents have ever competed.  I am happy to vote, but I must say, like most young people I do not think it makes any difference,  said a young woman, who requested anonymity because she holds an important government job. She added that there was an ongoing discussion on how to reform the electoral process and make government more responsive. This year a coalition of opposition groups ran more than 160 pre-candidates, but most were blocked by state security from nomination meetings, and none are running on Sunday. ",1.0
Texas prosecutor offers probation to anti-abortion activist behind video,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - An anti-abortion activist indicted for using a fake drivers license ID to aid secret filming inside Planned Parenthood facilities turned himself into authorities in Houston on Thursday and was offered a probation deal, prosecutors said. David Daleiden, indicted in January by a Houston-area grand jury, appeared at Harris County District Court on a charge of tampering with a governmental record, which can bring up to 20 years in prison. He also faces a misdemeanor charge for trying to procure fetal tissue. Daleiden leads the California-based Center for Medical Progress that released the secretly filmed videos used to accuse the womens health group of trading in aborted fetal tissue.  He was offered a probation deal in which, if he keeps a clean record for a certain period of time, charges would be dropped, prosecutors said.   Daleidens lawyers said he planned to reject the deal and is seeking an apology from prosecutors. Daleiden told a news conference outside court that he wants Texas to prosecute Planned Parenthood, saying it is open for business in baby body parts.  Planned Parenthood has denied Daleidens allegations and sued in federal court, arguing the people who recorded the videos acted illegally. In a twist for the Texas Republican leaders who had ordered an investigation, the grand jury in January cleared Planned Parenthood of wrongdoing and indicted video makers Daleiden and Sandra Merritt. Were glad theyre being held accountable, and we hope other law enforcement agencies pursue criminal charges, as well, said Eric Ferrero, vice president at Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Merritt, a lesser figure in the filming, appeared at a Houston court on Wednesday and was also offered a probation deal. Lawyers for the activist do not dispute that the pair used false IDs but said they did so for investigative journalism. Countering that contention, Eric Ferrero, vice president at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said, We dont know of any journalists who have engaged in wire fraud and mail fraud, lied to multiple government agencies, tampered with government documents, and broken laws in at least four states only to lie about what they found. Its hard to imagine anyone calling that journalism.  The videos released last summer purported to show Planned Parenthood officials trying to negotiate prices for aborted fetal tissue. Under federal law, donated human fetal tissue may be used for research, but profiting from its sale is prohibited.

 The Law Says Donald Trump Can Already Be Impeached And That Might Be The Plan,"The moment Donald Trump is sworn in as president, Congress could begin impeachment proceedings and they could win. It could easily happen, and as much as we can t stand Trump, that would be horrible.Before you shake your head and dismiss this as just another conspiracy theory, here are some facts from a Utah law professor, Christopher Lewis Peterson, who wrote a 22 page article telling us how and why Congress can and should impeach Trump. Clearly, we won t reprint all of the 22 pages, but here s the abstract, which by itself is pretty compelling:In the final weeks of the 2016 Presidential campaign Donald J. Trump faces three lawsuits accusing him of fraud and racketeering. These ongoing cases focus on a series of wealth seminars called  Trump University  which collected over $40 million from consumers seeking to learn Trump s real estate investing strategies. Although these consumer protection cases are civil proceedings, the underlying legal elements in several counts that plaintiffs seek to prove run parallel to the legal elements of serious crimes under both state and federal law. This essay provides a legal analysis of whether Trump s alleged behavior would, if proven, rise to the level of impeachable offenses under the presidential impeachment clause of the United States Constitution. This essay begins with a summary of the evidence assembled in the three pending Trump University civil lawsuits. Next, it describes the legal claims involved in each matter. Then, this essay summarizes the applicable law of presidential impeachment under the United States Constitution and analyzes whether Trump s actions in connection with Trump University are impeachable offenses. Finally, I offer concluding thoughts, considering in particular the policy implications of a major presidential campaign with simultaneously pending legal complaints of fraud and racketeering.Now, why would a Republican Congress impeach a Republican President? Well, as you recall, the vast majority of the GOP wing of Congress only reluctantly supported Trump.Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, was perhaps the most vocal reluctant supporter, saying that he was  sickened  by Trump s rhetoric, but would support him anyway.Most thought Ryan was sticking with Trump as a matter of political expediency. After all, they share the exact same voter base, but perhaps Ryan, who s not stupid, had something up his sleeve. Trump s VP pick, Mike Pence, is tailor made to help elevate Paul Ryan s agenda. He s  ber conservative and  ber Christian. While Trump is a wildcard, Pence is someone who Ryan can Trust. Pence won t squawk while Ryan strips senior citizens of Social Security or the poor of food. Trump might not squawk, but he s not predictable, either.While both Ryan and Pence (and most Republicans in Congress) are social conservatives who want to set back rights for LGBT people and women, again, Trump is a wildcard. Trump used to be pro-choice and despite the fact that his campaign was built on hate, he said very little about LGBT people. It s highly doubtful that Trump will defend the rights of gay people or abortion rights, but that s not a chance Ryan or Republicans in Congress want to take.The Trump University lawsuit is set to start at the end of the month. It s a civil suit, but it will highlight that voters elected a con man. It will certainly be enough to make the most anti-Trump members of Congress talk and it could give us a President Pence. Yes, that s frightening.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images. ",0.0

A YOUNG FATHER EXPLAINS SOCIALISM To His 10 Year Old SonA MUST Read For Every American,"The discussion Bret Stephens had with his 10 year old son, is one every parent should be having with the very generation who has the most to lose if socialism really is implemented in America. As parents, we re asked countless times by our children to explain ghosts, scary shadows on the walls, or some other imagined childhood fear. How many times however, do our children ask us to explain something that every American should truly fear? How many times do we have the opportunity to explain the reality of Socialism to our children?  We Applaud Bret Stephens of the Wall Street Journal for the brilliant way he explained Socialism to his son. We thank him for sharing it with his readers.Noah, my 10-year-old son, was reading over my shoulder a powerful story about the state of medicine in Venezuela by Nick Casey in Sunday s New York Times. We scrolled through images of filthy operating rooms, broken incubators and desperate patients lying in pools of blood, dying for lack of such basics as antibiotics. Dad, why are the hospitals like this? Socialism. What s socialism? I told him it s an economic system in which the government seizes and runs industries, sets prices for goods, and otherwise dictates what you can and cannot do with your money, and therefore your life. He received my answer with the abstracted interest you d expect if I had been describing atmospheric conditions on Uranus.Here s what I wish I had said: Socialism is a mental poison that leads to human misery of the sort you see in these wrenching pictures.The lesson seems all the more necessary when discredited ideologies are finding new champions in high places. When Venezuelan President Hugo Ch vez died in 2013, an obscure U.K. parliamentarian tweeted,  Thanks Hugo Chavez for showing that the poor matter and wealth can be shared. He made massive contributions to Venezuela & a very wide world. The parliamentarian was Jeremy Corbyn, now leader of the Labour Party.Up north, Naomi Klein, Canada s second-most unpleasant export, treated Ch vez as heroically leading the resistance to the forces of dreaded neoliberalism. Jimmy Carter mourned Ch vez for  his bold assertion of autonomy and independence for Latin American governments and for his formidable communication skills and personal connection with supporters in his country and abroad to whom he gave hope and empowerment. There are lesser names to add to this roll call of dishonor  Michael Moore, Sean Penn but you get the point:  Democratic socialism  had no shortage of prominent Western cheerleaders as it set Venezuela on its road to hyperinflation, hyper-criminality, water shortages, beer shortages, electricity blackouts, political repression and national collapse. Ch vez and his successor, Nicol s Maduro, gained prestige and legitimacy from these paladins of the left. They are complicit in Venezuela s agony.And so to the U.S. election, specifically the resolutely undead presidential candidacy of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The Sanders campaign is no stranger to accusations that its brand of leftism is cut from the same cloth that produced Chavismo. Yesterday, one of Hillary Clinton s most prominent Super PACs attacked our campaign pretty viciously,  Mr. Sanders complained in September, noting that they  tried to link me to a dead communist dictator. The senator protests too much. As mayor of Burlington, Vt., in the 1980s, he boasted of conducting his own foreign policy, including sister-city relations with Puerto Cabezas in Nicaragua and Yaroslavl in the Soviet Union. On a 1985 trip to Nicaragua, he lavished praise on Daniel Ortega s communist regime Chavismo s older cousin. In terms of health care, in terms of education, in terms of land reform . . . nobody denies they [the Sandinistas] are making significant progress in those areas,  then-Mayor Sanders told one interviewer in 1985.  And I think people understand that and I think the people of Nicaragua, the poor people, respect that. If Mr. Sanders ever rethought or recanted those views, I m not aware of it.But the point isn t what Mr. Sanders may have thought of the Sandinistas in the 1980s or the Chavistas in the past decade. It s that the type of socialism that the senator espouses $18 trillion in additional government spending over the next decade, accusations that Wall Street is a criminal enterprise and the continuous demonization of  millionaires and billionaires is not all that different from its South American cousins.Democratic socialism whether Chavez s or Sanders s is legalized theft in the name of the people against the vilified few. It is a battle against income inequality by means of collective immiseration. It is the subjugation of private enterprise and personal autonomy to government power. Mr. Sanders promises to pursue his aims on the Scandinavian model, as if that was a success, and as if Americans are Scandinavians. It wasn t. We aren t. Bernie s Way paves the same road to serfdom that socialism does everywhere.That s a fact Americans might have learned after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. We didn t. Take the time to tell your kids what socialism is, and does, before they too feel the Bern.Via: Wall Street Journal",0.0
MSNBC HOST Compares Getting Close to Trump to Hugging a Suicide Bomber [Video],"President Trump came out today and said he doesn t have tapes of former FBI Director James Comey but that the possibility of someone else taping the conversation is there. The lefty media went nuts and claimed that Trump lied. The political analyst on MSNBC even compared President Trump to a suicide bomber. Oh, the drama from these liberal news analysts!Elise Jordan CALLS HERSELF A POLITICAL ANALYST BUT WE THINK SHE S MORE LIKE A POLITICAL HACK!MSNBC s Craig Melvin and Jordan were discussing Trump s tweet on Thursday saying he has no recordings of his private conversations with former FBI Director James Comey. Trump had previously suggested such tapes may exist.MELVIN COMMENTED:  Earlier in the broadcast I said bluff. I said the president was bluffing. I may have been perhaps too fair. It would seem as if the president may have been lying all along about the existence of these tapes. JORDAN REPLIED:  He wasted the country s collective time speculating over whether these tapes existed or not. It s a sad day when you cannot depend on the president s word. My advice would just be to Republicans who do cozy up to him it s just like hugging a suicide bomber. He blows you up in the process with him. MELVIN REPLIED:  That s a little strong ",0.0
 Mentally-Ill Mother Shoots Sleeping Five-Year-Old In The Head (VIDEO),"The warning signs were everywhere.Forty-one-year-old Sara Atkinson had stopped taking her medication. According to family members, she was growing increasingly paranoid. She claimed there were bombs planted in her home and thought there cameras hidden inside her five-year-old son s shoes.At one point Atkinson had threatened to kill herself and take her son with her.Shortly before Kenny Kreuscher s mother put a .22 rifle to his head as he lay sleeping, the little boy told his father that his mommy had punched him.Ken Kreuscher Sr. recorded the conversation with his son, documenting marks left on the child by his mentally ill mother, hoping that someone would intervene.Over the course of the past year, Ken Kreuscher had filed numerous police reports and contacted child protective services multiple times. He d gone to court to try to get an order of protection. I ve been telling everyone in court this was a possibility that this would happen,  Kreuscher said during an interview with Denver s KDVR, on March 11.But while Kreuscher raised the alarm over and over, no-one intervened on his son s behalf.At the beginning of March, the Colorado mother left the state with Kenny, traveling to Roundup, Montana.On March 5, while still in Montana, she shot the little boy in his sleep. She then turned the gun on herself.The five-year-old died 12 hours later.Here s more on the story from KUSA.There s a fine line between violating the rights of person who has been diagnosed with mental illness and protecting the lives of innocent people.Under federal law, a person who has been deemed to be a threat to themselves or others is not supposed to be able to possess a gun. The problem with the law, however, is that there are very strict rules about when and how a person with serious mental illness is determined to be a  threat to themselves or others. In the case of Sara Atkinson, although the people closest to her, including her own son, were sounding the alarm about her mental health, the law offers little help.While it s unknown where Sara Atkinson got the gun that she used to kill herself and her child, there was likely no law preventing her from purchasing or owning a gun, in spite of the warning signs in her behavior.Restrictions on gun ownership are limited to people who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution, people who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity in a court of law and people who have been found incompetent to stand trial.At one time, local law enforcement officials were far more likely to err on the side of caution, requesting gun permits and licenses be revoked in cases where a person s behavior suggested a potential threat.For example, until 2010, local law enforcement officials in Tennessee could ask the state to revoke a gun permit in cases where a person  poses a material likelihood of risk to the public. But second amendment nuts challenged the state s law, calling it a violation of gun owner s rights.Thanks to the NRA, all across the country, it has become increasingly difficult to limit anyone s access to a gun.Today, even when all of the warning signs are there, it s nearly impossible to revoke a person s  right  to own a gun.Image credit: video screen capture via KUSA",0.0
"EXCLUSIVE Post-Election, Liberal Meltdown Explained In One Hilarious Poem: Ode To Liberal Lunacy","If you re like me . . . it s probably been an entertaining year Full of liberal lunacy, hypocrisy, and fear. There s been so many  episodes , it s easy to forget. Luckily, they ve all been logged upon the internet.The circus added one more ring when Donald got the nod To represent the GOP . . . the libs cried  Oh my God.  The media assured them there s no way that Trump could win So they sat back on their parent s couch, enamored by the spin.Election Day was coming . . . entertainment getting slow, Thank God the folks in Hollywood maintained the status quo. A host of A-list wannabes began to trickle forth, And told us that if Trump should win . . . they d all be headed north.When Donald passed two-seventy . . . and victory was at hand, A Trump-induced psychosis sprouted up in Liberal land. The fireworks were cancelled, and purveyors of fake news Were left to invent reasons why their candidate would lose.They blamed it all on Comey, then they blamed a Russian hack A dog that ate their homework, and of course . . . the men in black. A unicorn, a sasquatch, and a faulty Gallup Poll Next . . . they ll blame the shooter who was on the grassy knoll.Those celebs that promised egress . . . failed to adhere We waited for the moving trucks, which never did appear. Yes, not a star left Hollywood, although we wished it so, Despite the fact that Rush and Sean would pay for them to go.So now we re stuck with Miley, and we re stuck with Barbra too, Several washed-up actors . . . and the women of The View. We still have Maddow s meltdowns, and Sharpton s brand of hate. And, we still have Lena Dunham . . . though she s lost a little weight.In Congress, you can bet there s more than one defective gene. Just climb on board the crazy train with Nancy and Maxine. They often make me wonder just how awesome it would be, If parts of California could just slide into the sea.I m watching Liberal journalists like Cooper, Wolf, and Tapper, Spew the Leftist mantra . . . as their careers go down the crapper. Deplorables will have their fun with Liberal rank and file, Watching rats abandon ship when Clinton goes on trial.When Debbie left the DNC, I thought we d lost our clown. Then, from the state of Idaho, came Sally Boynton Brown. The DNC will be reborn, no matter what it takes. And the mix will look like cereal . . . with fruit loops, nuts, and flakes.Then, I saw the women s march, a feministic treat. I watched with fascination as they spilled into the street. Among the more disturbing sights were  lady  Democrats Who dressed up as vaginas . . . others wore their  kitty  hats.An incoherent Ashley Judd paraded  round a stage Saying all those  nasty women  should demand a higher wage. Then ranting about blood-stained sheets upon those women s beds. Somewhere a doctor s wondering why he took her off her meds.Madonna parked her walker to begin her caustic din, Dreams of blowing up the Whitehouse as senility sets in. Even in her senior years . . . the party never ends. She dances  round her nursing home in Vera Wang Depends.The Liberals, you must admit, have done some crazy things. It s fun to see them come unhinged as Donald pulls the strings. So, if you feel you need a shot of petulance and mirth, Sit back and watch the Liberals, it s the greatest show on earth.

 Conservative Christians Get Their Asses Handed To Them For Supporting Healthcare Repeal,"A former evangelical Christian is ripping conservatives for repealing the Affordable Care Act.Bruce Horst knows what it is like to have pre-existing conditions while trying to purchase health insurance. Prior to Obamacare, insurance companies refused to cover him, leaving him and his family vulnerable if a health crisis ever arose. But because of Obamacare, people with pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied health insurance.Obamacare literally saved Horst and his family from the threat of bankruptcy over a medical issue.But last week during a late night vote, Republicans in the Senate and House voted to repeal the healthcare law that covers over 30 million Americans.And conservatives cheered.Well, that didn t sit well with Horst, who despite being an atheist, probably knows the Bible better than most of these so-called evangelical  Christians  do.So Horst took these fake Christians to the woodshed on Facebook for applauding the death sentence Republicans just handed to millions of human beings. I have the simple conviction that it is immoral to give a person medical help according to how much they can pay,  Horst wrote.  Or maybe it s because of what I ve read in the Bible. In 2010 I had been a Conservative Evangelical Christian for all of my adult life. I began to realize that others around me despised the thought of allowing people like me the benefit of affordable health insurance. For some reason, all of the Christians that I knew thought that offering health insurance to people like me would put them at some kind of a disadvantage that they were not willing to accept. Frankly, they had been lied to so they believed those  others  were going to get healthcare and make their own healthcare inadequate.As a Christian, I believed that I would be judged on the Final Judgment Day on how I took care of the  least of these  as described in the Bible book of Matthew, chapter 25. I came to the sober realization that Christians around me had no such convictions. If they didn t believe Jesus  words as recorded in the Bible, why should I? Then one day I discovered I could no longer believe any of it.While conservatives complain that not as many people are attending church anymore, it turns out their hypocrisy and heartlessness is one of the reasons why people such as Horst have stopped believing. Stripping millions of Americans of the healthcare they need just further proved that Horst was right to leave the church when he did.Horst went on to call out Republicans in Congress and blasted how the hypocritical conservatives are when they claim to be  pro-life. I understand that Congress is about to take away the healthcare coverage of about 18 million of our fellow Americans. And they are doing this at the insistence of Conservative Evangelical Christians. I have friends who are alive today because of Obamacare. Probably all of us do. To me, this proves my Christian friends are not pro-life, but instead they ve been told they are as a matter of manipulation, probably to keep them putting money in the offering plate, or voting for the  right  candidate. One thing is clear to me, they are not really pro-life.I don t know what Congress is going to do with healthcare in the next few days. I would love to be surprised to find that President Trump has convinced Congress to extend healthcare coverage to all, and I would be among the first to be grateful for this. While even if this does occur, if my Christian friends insist that healthcare only be given to people based on their ability to pay for such care, I would have to believe that the Jesus of the Bible would say to them,  depart from me, I never knew you.  Just like He did in Matthew 25.In other words, conservatives are going to hell for condemning millions of Americans to suffer. It s not what Jesus would do and any conservative who says otherwise is only pretending to be a Christian.Featured Image: i.ytimg.com",0.0

TIFFANY & CO. TAKES BIG RISKSides AGAINST Trump On Very Controversial Issue,"Who knew? Tiffany & Co. just decided to show its hand when it comes to politics. We re not happy to tell you that the luxury retail jeweler just bought into the global warming scam hook, line and sinker The American jeweler is asking the president to keep the U.S. in the Paris Climate Agreement.The American jeweler took to social media to send a message to president Donald Trump. Dear President Trump,  read the Instagram and Twitter posts.  We re still in for bold climate action. Please keep the U.S. in the Paris Climate Agreement. The disaster of climate change is too real, and the threat to our planet and to our children is too great. The move comes on the same day that the president postponed his decision on whether or not to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, reports CNN. The goal of the agreement is to create  a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2 C,  according to European Commission s website.Trump intended on making an announcement before attending the Group of Seven nations summit in Sicily, Italy, on May 26-27, but now, he s going to make a decision after the G7, explained White House press secretary Sean Spicer.Trump has a long history with Tiffany & Co; he named his youngest daughter after the iconic jeweler and the brand s flagship store is connected to Trump Tower in New York. Following the election, sales at the flagship store tumbled 14 percent in November and December, compared with the same period last year. Tiffany & Co. even canceled its holiday window unveiling event due to post-election protests around the area.Read more: Hollywood ReporterWhat they re not telling you is this  agreement  is a HUGE redistribution of American tax dollars to other countries! So if we are to address the Climate crisis we need to challenge the structural causes of the crisis which lies on unequal distribution of wealth, of carbon, and of power. Whether it s political power, economic power, or even military power.  -Camille Risler For many years the public at large has been spoonfed the idea that Global Warming Climate Change, is caused by man s excessive release of carbon into the atmosphere. And that the solution to the Climate crisis was to decrease the production of said gas.Over the past several years the Global Warming fanatics have changed their tune. Many of us in the  new  media have been warning about their true motives for year.Now, instead of the climate crisis being caused by carbon emissions, it is being caused by inequality.On Monday, during a press conference at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris, Ms. Camille Risler, a representative of the Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development (APWLD) which is an organization listed as an official consultant to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, stated that the cause of Climate Change is the unequal distribution of wealth, carbon, and power: This is the press conference of the Women and constituency. It is one of the nine official constituencies of the UNFCCC, and we are composed of 15 women s rights and feminist organizations from all around the world. So I m going to begin with kind of an overview of our positions and then I will give the floor over to my colleagues that will go more into details of each section of negotiations.I m Camille Risler. I m from France but I m living in Thailand. I m working for a feminist network that is called Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development and I m working for the Climate Justice Program.So what we want to highlight here is that Climate Change is a clear symptom of an unequal and unjust world.

BREAKING: WDBJ KILLER WAS ANGRY BLACK DEMOCRATReprimanded For Wearing Obama Sticker At Work,"An angry black, gay, racist, Democrat victim the poster child for today s progressive in America Gay Black reporter Vester Flanagan was an Angry Barack Obama Democrat. ** He was reprimanded for wearing a Barack Obama sticker at work. ** He had his racial suits tossed from court ** He was a  high paid companion  ** He attempted to subpoena personnel records on both of his victimsThen he shot them dead Killer Vester Flanagan was a big Obama supporter.The Huffington Post reported:Vester Lee Flanagan, the man suspected of killing two Virginia television reporters Wednesday morning, attempted to subpoena personnel records on both of those victims, as well as other staff members, as part of a lawsuit against the TV station.Flanagan s lawsuit, filed in the Roanoke City General District Court in March 2014, requested $25,000 from WDBJ, the station, which had terminated his employment the previous year. The suit cited wrongful termination, unpaid overtime wages, racial discrimination and sexual harassment for identifying as gay. The case was dismissed due to lack of evidence, although it s unclear whether a settlement was reached.According to an internal memo included in the court documents, after Flanagan was presented with a severance letter in February 2013, he said,  You better call police because I m going to make a big stink.  A newsroom employee called 911, and police officers arrived to physically escort Flanagan from the building.Memos indicate that Ward videotaped Flanagan as he was escorted out. Flanagan told Ward to  lose your big gut,  and flipped off the camera.WDBJ objected to Flanagan s request for employee documents, claiming the personnel records were proprietary information and irrelevant to his claims.The court filings also include Flanagan s application for employment at WDBJ and his resume, in which he reported graduating from San Francisco State University with a 3.7 grade point average and his affiliation with the National Association of Black Journalists.Flanagan was offered a position with WDBJ on March 6, 2012, as a multimedia journalist/general assignment reporter with an annual salary of $36,000. However, he quickly racked up a misconduct record during his year of employment.In a performance review in August 2012, Flanagan was given a  1,  the lowest rating, for being  respectful to coworkers at all times,  but a  4  for work diligence and attendance. He was written up in November 2012 for wearing a Barack Obama sticker.By the end of that year, his supervisor was expressing dissatisfaction with the quality of Flanagan s work, as well as his attitude towards his co-workers. Dan Dennison, the station s news director at the time, cited a story in which Flanagan reported on a local church s response to the mass shooting at Newtown, Connecticut. Via: Gateway Pundit",0.0

 Jeb Bush Rally Becomes Counseling Session As Supporters Give Him Advice To Fix His Struggling Campaign,"A desperate Jeb Bush held a campaign rally at a South Carolina golf course on Wednesday, and all his supporters wanted to do was give him advice on how to fix his struggling campaign.Bush was probably hoping to come out swinging as the South Carolina primary approaches, but his worried fans had different concerns.Like a child being advised on how to deal with being bullied, one Bush supporter named Edward Scott told Bush that he should  raise the bar  and rise above the bullying by Trump because his message is being lost the more Bush gets frazzled by the billionaire mogul. Your message doesn t resonate with the national community.   I was wondering because of your civility if you could raise the bar in the next session and try to be beyond the bully because I think that s who you are and I think they try to knock you off center. It appears you do get knocked off center, like anyone would, because of the insults to your family. I don t think I feel shaken up by the bully,  Bush replied.  I m the only guy going after the guy who I believe is hijacking the party. David Villinger also voiced concern about Trump taking over the race while Bush desperately focuses on attacking him instead of focusing on delivering his own message. I think the campaign has been co-opted by the P.T. Barnum of our time. And I think he is getting you off your good message and all the times that you ve shared with us today. But I think I would encourage you to emphasize those things. Indeed, Jeb Bush is currently polling in a distant fourth place behind Trump, who leads the field with 34 percent while Bush only has under 10 percent.Cruz clocks in at second place with 17 percent and Rubio is a close third place with 16 percent. Clearly, nobody is really all that excited about Jeb.In the end, Jeb Bush not only received advice, he got bad news because South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley endorsed Marco Rubio even after Jeb sent his brother to meet with her. Jeb could only give reporters some parting sarcasm. It s all been decided, apparently. The pundits have already figured it out. We don t have to go vote. I should stop campaigning maybe. And that s probably the best idea Jeb Bush has had throughout his entire campaign. Featured image from Flickr",0.0
 WATCH: Donald Trump Is An Imbecile Who Doesnt Understand How Executive Orders Work (VIDEO),"The more a Trump run for the White House as a major party candidate sinks in, the more his blatant incompetence stands out. In this recent interview with Greta Van Susteren, Trump is discussing possibilities for the vice presidency, which Trump has announced will be unveiled at the GOP convention. The convention, already guaranteed to be the circus the sideshows have been building up to, will definitely have the highest viewer ratings of all time. Trump then hints that his VP pick will most likely be a person with a political background because he believes passing legislation is more important than using executive orders to get things done.Then it happened. The thing that will bring Donald Trump to his knees. He pretended to know what he was talking about and said something incredibly stupid. As the race goes on, more people with a little bit of knowledge about something are going to hear something like this and realize immediately that it s amazing that Donald Trump ever graduated high school. He s a showman who built a movement of stupidity on social media and reality television. His remarks to Van Susteren about executive orders prove that he is completely incompetent to hold the office that issues them:  We re not gonna do the executive order thing like Obama. He couldn t get anything passed You re not gonna do executive orders?  asked Van Stern,  No executive orders? Well, we ll see,  says Trump,   It depends on what, but President Obama has been signing a lot of executive orders nobody s ever heard of an executive order before. I mean, I know Bush signed them and other people have signed them, but all of a sudden it s like this major event to get things done. It would be nice to go back to the old-fashioned way   it s called passing legislation; having people get together to pass legislation. You can just hear Joe Pesci doing a scene from Goodfellas.  Hey, yo What the hell is dis  zecutive order bullsh*t. At ain t The way we do things in Hell s Kitchen.  It s ridiculous. President Obama and a team of lawyers combed the laws and precedents of our country, being fully qualified and empowered to do so, and imposed directives to the agencies under the purview of the executive branch, like the INS, as any chief executive of any company would do to those under him. When the president signs an executive order it doesn t become a law, it becomes the current policy of the federal government in its own dealings.That certainly can have a profound effect on shaping federal law, as it sends a profound statement, but as for the bulk of executive orders, they cover the mundane to the ridiculous and have been signed by every single United States President. President Obama has signed fewer than either of the Bush buffoons or Uncle Ronny Reagan. Donald Trump doesn t even need to be prompted to Palin himself. He just does it by complete instinct at this point.",0.0

RINO SENATOR From Red State Tells Illegal Aliens: You Have Done Nothing WrongJoins Dems To Push DREAM ACT Legislation Only Hours After Trump Rescinds DACA [VIDEO],"Here are a few facts explaining who the DACA recipients really are.  The National UnDACAmented Research Project was compiled by Harvard University researcher Roberto G. Gonzales and published by the Center For Immigration Studies (CIS):In April 2016, the Washington Times reported that a massive anti-deportation infrastructure had emerged to try to protect illegal immigrants from President Trump s crackdown, with advocacy groups coaching potential deportees on how to massage encounters with police, and lawyers and judges working to shield them from charges that would make them priorities for deportation.A video released Monday by a coalition of advocates instructs illegal immigrants not to open the door to federal agents, what proof to demand if they are being arrested and what to say if accosted outside their homes.Meanwhile, attorneys are working to lower charges from some illegal immigrant criminals, hoping to blunt their crimes so they don t show up as high-priority deportation targets.The Washington Times reported on a recent case in California, where an immigrant from India was accused of abusing his wife. The Santa Clara prosecutor told The Daily Beast that he reduced a felony assault charge to a felony accessory after the fact charge in order to spare the man a sentence that would have made him a deportation risk.IJR- The same day that President Donald Trump  rescinded  the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) held a joint press conference in which they reintroduced legislation that would see Congress tackling many of the issues that DACA comprises. What Senator Graham and I want to deliver is the message today, is that we need to do our job right here in the United States Senate,  Durbin said.  We need to pass, in this month of September, a DREAM Act, a permanent law in this country, that says that these young people will have their chance to become part of America s future. The DREAM   Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors   Act has been circling Congress for more than a decade, having first been introduced by Durbin and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) in 2001. The legislation has failed to pass each time it has been introduced.Durbin then took a moment to speak directly to the DREAMers, saying,  Do not give up hope. If you are one of those DREAMers,  Durbin continued,  one of those protected by DACA, you need to be part of America in its future. We made a promise to you that if you gave this information to our government about you and your family, it wouldn t be used against you. I don t want that to ever happen. Durbin then turned over the podium to Graham, who said right out of the gate, speaking to the DACA participants,  you have done nothing wrong. You ve demonstrated your ability to be beneficial to the country now and in the future,  Graham said.  The only thing that stands between you and certainty in your life is the Congress. That cannot be that reassuring. Congress is going to have to up its game,  Graham opined. ",0.0
U.S. Senate aims to vote later Wednesday on Puerto Rico bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate is aiming to finish its work and vote later on Wednesday on final passage of a relief plan to help Puerto Rico address its $70 billion debt, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said.

Saudis pledge $100 million to African anti-jihadist force: Mali,"DAKAR (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has pledged $100 million to a new regional military force battling jihadist groups in West Africa s Sahel region, force member Mali said on Monday.  The contribution would be a major boost to the cash-strapped force and bring pledged commitments to more than half the roughly $500 million the G5 Sahel says it needs for its first year of operations.   The G5 Sahel - composed of the armies of Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad - launched its first military campaign in October amid growing unrest in the Sahel, whose porous borders are regularly crossed by jihadists, including affiliates of al Qaeda and Islamic State. Those groups have stepped up attacks on civilian and military targets, including tourist attractions in regional capitals, raising fears the zone will become a new breeding ground for militants.   Mali s foreign ministry said Saudi Arabian authorities made the pledge during a visit to the kingdom late last month by Malian Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Diop.  Saudi Arabia s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Sunni Muslim kingdom is competing with its main rival, Shi ite power Iran, for influence across West Africa and other parts of the Muslim world. Donors from both countries have given money to mosques and other causes there. France, the G5 s most vocal foreign backer, has pressed Saudi Arabia to take concrete actions to fight Islamist militants. French President Emmanuel Macron asked Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to contribute to the G5 when he saw him in Riyadh last month.  The European Union, France, the United States and each of the G5 countries have also promised to fund the force.    ",1.0
U.S. lawmakers raise privacy concerns over new hacking rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of lawmakers in the U.S. Congress on Thursday asked the Justice Department to clarify how a looming rule change to the governments hacking powers could impact privacy rights of innocent Americans. The change, due to take place on December 1, would let judges issue search warrants for remote access to computers located in any jurisdiction, potentially including foreign countries. Magistrate judges can normally only order searches within the jurisdiction of their court, which is typically limited to a few counties. We are concerned about the full scope of the new authority that would be provided to the Department of Justice, 23 senators and representatives wrote to Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The Supreme Court in April approved amendments to Rule 41 of the federal rules of criminal procedure that would allow judges to issue warrants in cases when a suspect uses anonymizing technology to conceal the location of his or her computer or for an investigation into a network of hacked or infected computers, such as a botnet.  Those amendments will take effect on December 1 of this year unless Congress passes legislation that would reject, amend or postpone the changes. Some lawmakers, led by Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, have introduced legislation that would halt the changes, but it has yet to gain much traction. In their letter, the lawmakers asked how the government would prevent under the expanded rule so-called forum shopping, where prosecutors seek warrants in districts considered more favorable to law enforcement.  They also asked how the Justice Department intends to notify users when electronic devices have been searched and whether law enforcement has the authority to disable malicious software on a protected device, including those belonging to innocent Americans, among other questions.  The Justice Department has worked on Rule 41 changes for years, arguing they are procedural in nature and necessary to keep pace with criminal threats posed by evolving technology. Civil liberties groups and some technology companies, including Alphabet Incs Google, have said the changes could allow for searches that run afoul of privacy rights. The Justice Department is reviewing the lawmakers letter, which asked for a response within two weeks, spokesman Peter Carr said. ",1.0
U.N. rights team to visit Mexico after journalist murders,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The United Nations said on Thursday a group of experts on freedom of expression will visit Mexico at the end of November to assess the safety of journalists in the country, one of the most dangerous in the world for reporters. David Kaye, U.N. Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, and Edison Lanza, who holds the same position at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, will visit from Nov. 27 to Dec. 4 after an invitation by the government.  This visit is about the crisis the press is going through in Mexico, the exponential increase in violence,  said Leopoldo Maldonado, the protection and defense program officer in Mexico at Article 19, a freedom of expression advocacy group. The visit comes as Mexico s journalists live through one of the worst waves of violence in recent history, with at least 11 reporters murdered in 2017, the same number killed in 2016. Over the past 17 years, 111 journalists have been killed in Mexico, more than one third of them under the administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto. Reporters are also having to contend with other forms of intimidation. In June, activists, human-rights lawyers and journalists filed a criminal complaint after experts found that their smartphones had been infected with advanced spying software sold only to the government. The Mexican government said at the time that there was no proof it was responsible for the spying and that it condemned any attempt to violate the privacy of any person. The rights experts will travel to Mexico City and the states of Guerrero, Veracruz, Tamaulipas and Sinaloa to meet legislative, executive and judicial authorities plus journalists and representatives of civil society, the U.N. said. Reporters Without Borders ranks Mexico at 147 out of 180 countries in its World Press Freedom Index, below Venezuela, South Sudan and Bangladesh, and one place above Russia.{rsf.org/en/ranking#} ",1.0

In response to the massive amount of hatred and bigotry that has been thrown at the trans community over the last few months, these amazing mothers have given anti-LGBT bigots a brilliant   and sometimes heartbreaking   look at the people who are on the receiving end of the attacks.The video, entitled  Meet My Child , was created by the Trans United Fund for the many transgender adults and children who have been discriminated against and attacked by politicians in 20 states via initiatives like  bathroom bills  in North Carolina. These lawmakers have made it their personal mission to strip trans people of their basic human rights and have Attempted to advance over 50 pieces of legislation attacking transgender people. These policies are a real danger to transgender people and hurt the most vulnerable, including America s transgender children. Meet My Child features three mothers sharing amazing stories of acceptance and love, as well as the process their families when through when their child expressed that they were transgender.

SAY WHAT? PROSECUTORS Claim Convicted ISLAMIC TERRORIST Used His LAPTOP and Jihadi Materials To Radicalize Fellow Prisoners In NY Prison,"According to The Sun, George W. Bush  successor, Barack Obama, promised to close the camp in 2009, calling it a  sad chapter in American history .But he faced strong opposition from Congress and succeeded only in reducing the number of inmates from 245 to around 40, as detainees were either freed or transferred to other countries.Since his election in 2016, Donald Trump has vowed to keep the prison open and use it to detain  bad dudes .He has also stated he would happily use torture against inmates.He said:  I would bring back waterboarding, and I d bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding  Don t tell me it doesn t work torture works  if it doesn t work, they deserve it anyway, for what they re doing to us. We have to fight fire with fire. According to CNN, the man convicted in the 2016 bombing in New York s Chelsea neighborhood that injured 30 people has been trying to radicalize other inmates, federal prosecutors say.Ahmad Khan Rahimi also told a judge he is on a hunger strike.Rahimi provided inmates with copies of terrorist propaganda and jihadist materials, including speeches by Osama Bin Laden and the late militant cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, bomb-making instructions, books on jihad and issues of the al Qaeda-backed magazine Inspire, prosecutors said.Rahimi  has been attempting to radicalize fellow inmates in the Metropolitan Correction Center by, among other things, distributing propaganda and publications issued by terrorist organizations,  according to a letter from Acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim to US District Judge Richard Berman.Rahimi let other inmates view the items on his laptop and gave them electronic copies, Kim s letter said. Discs of the materials were found in two inmates  possession.Defense attorneys for Rahimi have yet to respond to the allegations.Prosecutors said Rahimi began distributing these materials in October if not earlier. Rahimi was convicted October 16 on eight federal charges in connection with the Chelsea bombing.Among the inmates Rahimi gave the materials to, prosecutors say, is Sajmir Alimehmeti, who is scheduled to go on trial next month on terrorism-related charges.Rahimi was arrested and charged after a pressure cooker bomb went off in New York s Chelsea neighborhood on September 17, 2016. A second pressure cooker bomb was found a few blocks away, on 27th Street, but didn t detonate.Earlier the same day, a bomb went off near the start of a Marine Corps charity run in Seaside Park, New Jersey.After a two-week trial and roughly four hours of jury deliberation, Rahimi was convicted of charges including the use and attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, bombing a public place, destroying property by means of fire or explosives, and using a destructive device in furtherance of a crime of violence.During the trial, the prosecution presented evidence   including DNA and fingerprints   linking Rahimi to the bombs that were placed in New Jersey and New York.Rahimi faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison, according to an earlier statement from Kim.Rahimi faces separate charges in other jurisdictions in connection with the bomb that went off in Seaside Park, a backpack containing improvised explosive devices found the following day at a transit station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and a shootout he had with police before being taken into custody.",0.0
Two Republican senators seek to slash legal U.S. immigration,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Republican senators proposed steps to slash the number of legal immigrants admitted into the United States by half on Tuesday, but the legislation, developed with the Trump administration, faces an uphill climb to get through Congress. Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue said their bill would cut the number of immigrants granted U.S. residency each year to 500,000 from 1 million, through measures including cutting far back on which relatives can be brought into the country and eliminating a diversity visa lottery. The legislation does not address visas specifically tied to employment, such as the H-1B visas for skilled workers used by many technology companies. Cotton and Perdue said they had consulted Republican President Donald Trump, who vowed to crack down on both illegal and legal immigration during his campaign for the White House. Cotton said he had spoken to Trump about the bill by telephone as recently as Tuesday morning. The measure faces stiff opposition in Congress. Although Trumps fellow Republicans control majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives, several back comprehensive immigration reform, not a tough crackdown. Republican Senator John McCain said he disagreed with the bill. A long-time advocate for immigration reform, McCain praised the contribution of immigrants to the United States. We need more Sergey Brins and people like that who were born outside of this country and came here, received an education and made enormous progress for all mankind, McCain told reporters, referring to the Google co-founder, who came to the United States as a refugee from Russia. Any measure also would need Democratic support to advance in the Senate, and Democrats, who cite studies showing that immigrants boost the U.S. economy, are strongly opposed. Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen called it wrong and senseless to separate families and cut successful visa programs.  Perdue and Cotton acknowledged the bill would not come up any time soon, saying they hoped for a Senate vote this year. Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said Congress first needed to address border security, but said the new measure will be a helpful constructive proposal. The bill would admit only immediate family members of immigrants, eliminating preferences for adult siblings or adult children. Cotton said it would exclude parents unless they were sick and the family promised not to rely on public benefits. The proposal came amid a larger immigration fight over Trumps travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees. Cotton said his goal was to stop competition that lowers wages for workers without high school or college degrees. Unless we reverse this trend, we are going to create a near-permanent underclass for whom the American dream is always just out of reach, he said. Asked if the White House would support the legislation and whether it was working with the senators, a spokesman said, We are reviewing it. U.S. companies often argue in favor of immigration. More than 100 filed a legal brief opposing Trumps travel ban.   ",1.0
 Ex-KKK Grand Wizard: Maine Gov. Right To Call Out Black Mens Defilement Of White Women,"David Duke is perhaps one of the most notorious Grand Wizards of the Ku Klux Klan alive today. He also had quite a bit to say about Maine Governor Paul LePage s recent racist rant. LePage suggested that black drug dealers are coming into his state and selling drugs, and while they re at it, getting white women pregnant.Of course, the backlash was ferocious for LePage s remarks, and he tried to walk them back.  But David Duke, being the vile racist that he is, devoted airtime on a recent edition of his radio show to defend LePage. Calling LePage s racism the Trump effect of people not talking in politically correct manner,  Duke said: You are probably picking yourself off the floor to think that an elected governor in the United States of America would actually talk about this horrible destruction and defilement of young white women. These are not Anglo-Saxon guys from rural Maine doing this. These are, again, like the Puff Diddys   or whatever they want to call themselves   from New York. So, a black man having sex with a white woman is  defilement.  These remarks are especially egregious, considering the history in the United States of black men being lynched at the drop of a hate when a white woman cries rape. In the eyes of racists, there is nothing worse than a white woman coupling with a black man. If David Duke thought the historical context of what he is saying here would be lost on the rest of us, he is dead wrong.Duke also had a guest on his show who echoed his racist beliefs, Pastor Mark Dankof. Duke and Dankof then turned their attentions to Democratic Presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton, because of her speaking out against police brutality against people of color. Duke said to Dankof: Isn t this the same Hillary Clinton who has constantly told us about black people being victimized by police? She says that this is a racist problem that police are shooting down blacks. When the fact is, they shoot down proportionally a far higher capita of a white person who acts criminally. This is a lie, of course. See the Bundy militia for Exhibit A. If those were black people, they d have been dead the first day. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is white privilege. But then again, of course the likes of David Duke would never understand that, and nor would he want to.Duke s full comments can be heard here, at his media archive.Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story",0.0
CROOKED DEMOCRAT Congresswoman Corrine Brown Found GUILTY of STEALING Scholarship Money From ChildrenBlames RACISM For Verdict,"Celebrated Congressional Black Caucus member, and  legend  Corrine Brown would like Americans to believe that stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from underpriveleged children in her district, and using the money to vacation with her daughter, is not the reason she s been found guilty of 18 counts of fraud and corruption, it s because she is black. Washington Examiner   She partied with Nancy Pelosi, traveled on Air Force one next to President Obama, and cast her superdelegate vote for Hillary Clinton. But on February 9, 2017, Corrine Brown was in federal court for stealing scholarship money from school children.The disgraced congresswoman attempted to defend against charges that she funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars from a non-profit charity, One Door for Education, into her own pocket.After her former chief of staff testified against her, the question was no longer whether or not she s guilty. It s why Democrat brass would continually cozy up to a congresswoman who was so clearly corrupt?From the beginning, Brown s been shrouded in controversy. Shortly after she won election in 1992, the Federal Election Commission accused Brown of violating numerous campaign finance laws. Most notably, she accepted donations from foreign citizens and failed to report the use of a corporate plane. And that s just the tip of the ethical iceberg.A convenient rap sheet, put together last July by the Florida Times-Union, documents every allegation of wrongdoing brought against Brown during her 27-year career. Hollywood couldn t have better scripted some of the highlights.In 1998, Brown cashed a $10,000 check from Rev. Henry Lyons, the disgraced president of the National Baptist Convention who spent five years in federal prison for fraud. The congresswoman said tthat she used the unreported money to bus her supporters to an event.In 2000, Brown battled back a House Ethics investigation into her efforts to free imprisoned West African millionaire Foutanga Dit Babani Sissoko from federal prison. She appealed to Attorney General Janet Reno for help, asking her to spring Sissoko from prison. Though unsuccessful, Brown received a new Lexus worth $50,000 for her trouble.And in 2008, Brown took heat from the mayor of Jacksonville after she had sandbags delivered by the city to protect her home from Tropical Storm Fay. The congresswoman eventually pledged to pay the city $886.But none of this dissuaded Democrats from palling around the Florida woman. It s mind boggling that Brown not only fundraised with the president but also enjoyed prominent perches on the Transportation and Veteran Affairs Committees.First Coast News   On Thursday, November 16, 2017, the former Jacksonville area Congresswoman Corrine Brown took the stand, and plead for mercy from federal judge Timothy Corrigan. I am sorry you have to be here today to see me in this situation,  Brown said in her statement to the court.  I never imagined I would one day be in court asking people to speak on my behalf   never. In hindsight, I wished I had been more diligent in overseeing my personal and professional life The idea that some people could believe these charges hurt me because it runs contrary to everything I ve ever believed and done in my life. I hope and pray these proceedings to don t make them [ordinary people] lose faith in the system. I humbly ask for mercy and compassion. Brown was convicted on 18 counts of fraud and corruption in May.The lead prosecutor in the sentencing hearing argued Thursday that the former congresswoman should be sentenced to about 7.5 to 9 years in federal prison. Her defense attorney is seeking probation and community service.Brown s defense attorney James Smith objected to various aspects of the sentencing recommendations, including how much money Brown should be culpable for.Prosecutor Duva asked the court,  What accountability does the law require?  during his presentation.Duva said Brown was accustomed to receiving money she should not have received. She also lied about donations to colleges, churches and other entities.He also argued that Brown has made ludicrous comments during the investigation, including a comment where she essentially said that had investigators not been looking into her case, the Pulse shooting in Orlando would never have happened. She also referred to the charges as  bogus  and  racist,  implying that she was targeted for her race in the case.Duva objected to that notion by saying,  She was targeted because she committed fraud, not because she was black or white. Corrine Brown had several witnesses come forward Thursday in support of her through witness testimony during the sentencing hearing.Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee provided a glowing character witness of Corrine Brown during her sentencing hearing Thursday.Jackson Lee described via telephone testimony it as her  privilege  to characterize Corrine Brown as a  loving person. She said Brown has had a  pointed and direct effort [in] helping others, not herself. The veterans  community loved Congresswoman Brown, Jackson Lee said, stating that Brown has helped those with PTSD and other issues following fighting overseas. She also stated Brown helped tremendously with relief efforts during Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. That shows a character of giving to others unselfishly,  Jackson Lee said.Additional arguments by defense attorneyThe defense attorney belabored the point that they are against the notion that Brown abused a position of trust, which is established by the evidence presented in the trial.Smith explained the definition of obstruction of justice, which Brown is accused of doing while taking the stand by the prosecutor, stating that it is the  intention or deliberate effort while on the stand to make material falsehoods. The judge wasn t so sure and asked the defense attorney to elaborate.Smith appeared to get emotional after posing two questions:  What type of sentence does justice require in this case?  and  How do you sentence someone who is a legend? He attributes some of her actions to the progress our country has made in terms of relations for black people.Smith said he met with an Orlando attorney who was from Jacksonville and said the attorney described Brown as  our Martin Luther King  for black Jacksonville natives. None of those people had to push the boulder up the mountain like she did,  said Smith, referring to others in Congress.  She truly is a legend. There are a lot of moving parts in the case against Corrine Brown and her co-conspirators.Carla Wiley first became involved in the fraud scheme when she started dating Ronnie Simmons.She was president of a charity called One Door for Education, which was never actually registered as a 501(c)(3).The fake charity received more than $800,000 in four years, with about only $1,200 of it actually going to scholarships for students. That money is now gone.Simmons was dating Wiley when he told her he needed a nonprofit to financially back a reception for congresswoman Brown in 2012. Wiley offered One Door for Education as an option for that reception.The charity claimed to give scholarships to poor and underprivileged children seeking the become teachers.Lead prosecutor A. Tysen Duva argued during the trial that Ronnie Simmons worked under Brown and did her bidding by taking out $800 a day from the One Door for Education bank account and depositing it into Brown s personal bank account. He did this numerous times, according to Duva and evidence released earlier this month.The fake charity was essentially used as a slush fund for Corrine Brown s travels, expenses and shopping, according to the prosecutors.She used the money put in her bank account to go to Nassau, Bahamas with her daughter, fly to Beverly Hills and shop along Rodeo Drive, and attend a Beyonc  concert, according to court documents and previous reports by First Coast News.The prosecutors also argued that Brown committed wire fraud, mail fraud and stole money from the government after she lied on tax documents.Brown had friends in high places, such as former CSX CEO Mike Ward. She would ask them for donation to Open Door for Education and many of them gladly donated, according to previous reports and prosecutor testimony.Ward, for instance, contributed $35,000 to One Door for Education after learning that the money would go toward providing students with iPads for learning.Prosecutors also argued that Brown lied about and inflated what she gave in tithes to various churches. The churches came forward in the trial and said the donations claimed to be given by Brown did not match their records, to which Brown said she sometimes gave anonymous donations.Other legitimate scholarship organizations came forward and said they had never received funds from Brown s charity.Meanwhile, Brown s tax returns claimed she contributed as much as $30,000   20 percent to a third of her income, to various charities.",0.0
ARIZONA BIKERS ARE ABOUT To Become Violent Dreamers Worst Nightmare At Upcoming Phoenix Trump Rally," The Left has been itching for a fight the only problem is, they ve been itching for a fight against Trump supporters who re outnumbered so they can t fight back. They may be biting off a bit more than they can chew this time around A group of bikers said it plans to protect supporters from possible violence at a Donald Trump rally scheduled to be held in Phoenix on Saturday. We re going to stand between them and any protesters that come onto the property and hopefully protect them from any bodily harm, should it get to that point,  Cindy Perrin with Lions Guard Arizona said.The rally is expected to begin Saturday about 4 p.m. at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum on the Arizona State Fairgrounds near 19th Avenue and McDowell Road.The protest will be held at nearby Encanto Park from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.Perrin said the biker group, made up mostly of retired police officers, such as herself, and veterans, will be wearing American flag bandanas so they are easy to identify. If they have any problems, they ll be able to locate us and ask us for help,  she said.Perrin said her group is not expecting things to take a violent turn outside of Trump s rally, unlike several events the presumptive Republican presidential nominee hosted in California. We re not expecting it to get to that point in Arizona,  she said.The bikers will not be the only group attempting to keep things calm on Saturday. Arizona Department of Public Safety Capt. Damon Cecil said his organization has reached out to groups both for and against Trump. Most of those groups   not all, but most of those groups   we have talked to their leadership and got assurances their protests were going to be peaceful,  he said.Protest organizers are also hoping things remain civil. My message to the folks that want to protest is: You know what? Why don t you pick up a clipboard, let s get some voter registrations and get some more families registered to vote who will vote against Trump come November,  Tony Navarette with Promise Arizona said.DREAM Act advocate Carmen Cornejo said protesters who act violently are doing nothing more than falling into line with Trump s rhetoric. I invite all young people to not react with violence to the provocations and the incendiary comments of Mr. Trump,  she said. Via: KTAR",0.0
"Britain, Saudi Arabia sign military cooperation deal: state media","RIYADH (Reuters) - Britain and Saudi Arabia signed a framework deal on military and security cooperation, Saudi state news agency SPA said on Tuesday, redoubling efforts to counter Iran in the Gulf region and defeat Islamic State. Prime Minister Theresa May said in December that Britain would invest over 3 billion pounds ($4.05 billion) in defense in Gulf Arab states over the next decade as it seeks to build on traditionally strong ties with the conservative, oil-wealthy monarchies before its planned departure from the European Union. British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon discussed military cooperation with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who serves as the kingdom s defense minister and deputy prime minister, the SPA report said without providing details of the agreement. Gulf Arab states say Iran is trying to expand its influence in Arab countries, including Syria, Iraq and Yemen. Since March 2015, Saudi Arabia and Arab allies have been waging war against Iran-aligned Houthi forces that seized control of much of Yemen. Britain s close relationship with Gulf states has drawn concern from human rights groups, including criticism of Saudi air strikes in Yemen s war that have killed hundreds of civilians. British military personnel have been working with the Saudi forces. ",1.0
Saudi-led air strikes support Yemen's Saleh as he shifts against Houthis,"ADEN (Reuters) - A Saudi-led coalition launched air strikes on Yemen s capital, Sanaa, local media said, lending support to former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh after he signaled he was abandoning his support of the Iran-aligned Houthis - a shift that could pave the way to end three years of war. In a speech on Saturday, Saleh appeared to indicate the end of his loyalists  alliance with Houthi fighters. He said he was ready to turn a  new page  in ties with the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis, if it stopped attacks on Yemeni citizens and lifted a siege.  Residents on Sunday, however, said a coalition air strike overnight killed 12 Yemeni civilians in one family in the northern province of Saada, the home territory of the Houthis. The attack could not be verified. Saudi-owned al-Arabiya television said on Sunday coalition aircraft pounded Houthi outposts in southern Sanaa overnight, but gave no details on casualties.  Separately, the Houthis, who together with Saleh s loyalists, control most of northern Yemen, said they had fired a cruise missile toward a nuclear power plant under construction in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a report quickly denied by the UAE. Saleh s announcement on Saturday was welcomed by the Saudi-led coalition, which has been backed by the United States and other Western powers. The coalition, which includes the United Arab Emirates, is trying to help Yemen s internationally recognized President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi back to power, but it has struggled to advance against Houthi-Saleh forces. A split between Saleh s armed allies and the Houthis could tip the balance of power.   Army units loyal to Saleh have been clashing with Houthi fighters in the past five days, adding a new layer to an already complex situation in Yemen. Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash appeared to back Saleh s side in remarks on his official Twitter page.  The events in Sanaa are murky, but its national uprising needs support ... to protect the Arabian Peninsula from Iranian expansion,  he said. Residents in Sanaa reported on Sunday that the Houthis appeared to be clawing back some territory lost to Saleh over the previous four days, and Houthi tanks were deployed amid heavy gun battles in the city s central Political District. The area is a stronghold of Saleh s loyalists under the command of his nephew Tareq, an influential army general. The fighting has cut off the airport road, prompting the United Nations to try to evacuate at least 140 aid workers from Sanaa, according to U.N. and other aid officials. The U.N. was awaiting approval from the Saudi-led coalition, they said.  Residents earlier said Houthi fighters seized the television studios of Yemen Today, a news channel owned by Saleh, after clashes that damaged the building. Residents said 20 employees were trapped inside. The Red Cross said dozens of people have been killed in clashes over the past five days and called for civilian lives to be spared. In Tehran, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi called for calm and restraint.  All internal disputes should be resolved through dialogue to block the grounds for any abuse by the enemies of the Yemeni nation,  he said, according to a statement on the ministry s website. Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Middle East, and the proxy war between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed Hadi has created widespread hunger and disease, in one of the worst humanitarian crises of recent times. More than 10,000 people have died since 2015, more than two million have been displaced and nearly a million have been infected by a cholera outbreak. Famine threatens much of the country. Yemen descended into violence in late 2014 when the Houthis, a group that follows the Zaidi branch of Shi ite Islam, marched on Sanaa and seized control of the government. Backed by government troops loyal to Saleh, the Houthis fanned out across the country, forcing Hadi to flee to Riyadh. His ouster led the alliance headed by the Saudis to join the fighting. The Houthis said the missile fired on Sunday was directed toward the al-Barakah nuclear power plant in Abu Dhabi, but provided no evidence of any attack. There were no reports of any missiles reaching Abu Dhabi. The country s crisis management authority said the al-Barakah was well protected and urged the public not to listen to rumors.  The National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority denies claims by the coup trumpets in Yemen that they fired a missile toward the airspace of the United Arab Emirates,  the department said in a statement carried by state news agency WAM. It said the nuclear power project was  fortified and sturdy against all possibilities. And enjoys all measures of nuclear safety and security that such grand projects require . The Houthis had said Abu Dhabi, a member of the Saudi-led coalition fighting against them since 2015, was a target for their missiles.  The Barakah project, which is being built by Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) (015760.KS), is expected to be completed and become operational in 2018, the UAE energy minister has said. It is the second time this year the Houthis have said they have fired missiles toward the UAE. A few months ago, they said they had  successfully  test-fired a missile toward Abu Dhabi, but there were no reports of any rockets being intercepted by or falling in the UAE. ",1.0
 Danny Glover Is Appalled That Trump Is Time Magazines Person Of The Year,"The nation was in an uproar on Wednesday, after learning that Donald Trump, the most divisive person in modern history to be elected president (and yes, I m including Richard M. Nixon) was chosen as Time Magazine s  Person of the Year.  Actor Danny Glover is one of the people who spoke out about the cover.Image via Time MagazineNow, to be fair, the honor isn t always an honor. Hitler once graced the cover of the  Man of the Year  issue. As for Trump, Time said this:For those who believe this is all for the better, Trump s victory represents a long-overdue rebuke to an entrenched and arrogant governing class; for those who see it as for the worse, the destruction extends to cherished norms of civility and discourse, a politics poisoned by vile streams of racism, sexism, nativism. To his believers, he delivers change broad, deep, historic change, not modest measures doled out in Dixie cups; to his detractors, he inspires fear both for what he may do and what may be done in his name.The revolution he stirred feels fully American, with its echoes of populists past, of Andrew Jackson and Huey Long and, at its most sinister, Joe McCarthy and Charles Coughlin. Trump s assault on truth and logic, far from hurting him, made him stronger. His appeal part hope, part snarl dissolved party lines and dispatched the two reigning dynasties of U.S. politics. Yet his victory mirrors the ascent of nationalists across the world, from Britain to the Philippines, and taps forces far more powerful than one man s message.The article neglected to mention that Clinton won the popular vote. It barely mentioned Trump s racism, his xenophobia and his sexism. For that, and for the very fact that Trump is on the cover, Glover is p*ssed! It s irresponsible to make him person of the year,  Glover told reporters gathered at the Freedom Plaza rally.  Based on what? Based on the fact that he won the Electoral College? Based on the fact that he lied to people? Based on the fact that all the stories of all he s done to women and what he thinks about women. Based on his racism?  the actor continued. A racist as  Person of the Year?  Glover added. I m appalled, I m appalled. I m angry now that Time magazine would name this person  Person of the Year.  It s incredible,  the actor went on.Source: Daily MailGlover went on to talk about the fact that Trump ran on a campaign of racism and xenophobia. He called the magazine cover,  disrespectful,  and  a slap in the face.  As for giving the President Elect a chance, no way. Give him a chance what?  the actor mused.  You know what happens here. We fight harder. We push harder. We know who he is. We know exactly who he is. (W)e have to fight him every inch. We have to fight him every moment. Glover is right. Since the election, and even before, the media has bent over backward to normalize Trump and even his white nationalist followers. There is no  both sides,  not now. There is no  alt-right.  They are neo-nazis. The media needs to step up and do its job. We need journalists and media sources who aren t afraid to tell the truth about Trump. Time Magazine should be ashamed.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",0.0
TAKE THEM OFF OR PAY HUGE FINE! #NFL Wont Allow Player To Honor 9-11 Victims With Memorial CleatsDisrespecting Our Flag On 9-11 Is A-Okay,"We re still waiting for the NFL to make a statement about the disrespectful protests by multi-millionaire players who plan to protest an  oppressive  America and the cops who defend the stadiums, keeping fans and players safe while they play football on 9-11 Even as the NFL turns a blind eye to the lengthening list of players protesting America by refusing to stand for the national anthem, the league has decided to crack down on a player who announced his intention to wear cleats to memorialize the vicious terror attacks on September 11, 2001. Now a police union is vowing to pay the player s NFL fine if he ll wear them despite the league s punishment.The NFL has officially banned Tennessee Titans linebacker Avery Williamson from wearing cleats custom made as a memorial to the victims and first responders who fell in the line of duty during that terrible day on 9/11.In response the disappointed Williamson announced that instead of wearing them during Sunday s game with the Minnesota Vikings he would auction them off with the proceeds going to benefit Operation Warrior Wishes.But after hearing of the NFL s denial of Williamson s request to honor the fallen, two police unions stepped forward pledging to pay what would be a $6,000 NFL fine if the player ignored the league s demands and wore them anyway.For his part, the player said he doesn t want to cause anyone any trouble and just wanted to do a nice thing for the country. I don t want to draw negative attention, so I m just going to focus on playing the game,  Williamson said of the ban on the cleats.  Once I heard from them, I didn t even try to argue anything. I just left it alone. I didn t want to press the issue. The shoes Williamson calls his  patriot cleats  are blue with red- and white-striped Nike swooshes featuring the words  Never Forget  and  9/11  on the back. Also a number  11  representing the Twin Towers appear. The shoes were airbrushed by True Blue Customs in Lexington, Kentucky.In its denial the NFL reminded Williamson that all teams must be uniform on the field and no single player may wear unauthorized gear or sport special decorations upon that gear. The ban is usually aimed at keeping unauthorized financial sponsorships from appearing on field.This isn t the first time the NFL has denied a player s request to honor police or first responders, even as other players are permitted to indulge protests against the U.S.A. and support for Black Lives Matter.Only last month the NFL refused to allow the Dallas Cowboys to wear decals on their helmets showing support for the Dallas Police Department, which lost five officers in one terrible attack in July.The  Arm In Arm  decal was to have been worn when the team opened its preseason schedule during a game with the Los Angeles Rams.For entire story: Breitbart News",0.0

 Prominent Attorney And Law Professor Points Out That Trump Can Be Impeached For False Accusation Against Obama,"When Donald Trump falsely accused President Obama of wiretapping him he committed an impeachable offense.That s what Harvard Law professor Laurence Tribe wrote in response to Jonathan Turley on Tuesday after Turley claimed that Trump can t be impeached for posting  bad tweets. During an appearance on Morning Joe, Turley claimed that Trump could not be impeached for accusing President Obama of wiretapping him because the Constitution was written before Twitter was invented. There s no penalty to the president for bad tweets,  the George Washington University law professor claimed.  There s no impeachment for bad tweets,  he continued, arguing that the impeachment clause doesn t apply because Twitter  postdated the impeachment clause. Basically, Turley is saying that the Constitution only applies to society as it was in the 18th century, which is the kind of bullshit that conservative originalists use as an excuse to block progress.Well, Tribe was watching on Tuesday and he fired off a series of tweets slamming Turley. Using power of W[hite] H[ouse] to falsely accuse predecessor of impeachable felony does qualify as an impeachable offense whether via tweet or not,  Tribe concluded.1/On @JoeNBC @JonathanTurley says Trump s false claim that 44 wiretapped him cdn t be impeachable because #Twitter didn t exist when the  Laurence Tribe (@tribelaw) March 7, 20172/Impeachment Cl. was written in 1787.

Laurence Tribe (@tribelaw) March 7, 20173/Using power of WH to falsely accuse predecessor of impeachable felony does qualify as an impeachable offense whether via tweet or not  Laurence Tribe (@tribelaw) March 7, 2017In fact, Trump is not only abusing his power by falsely accusing a former president of a crime, he opened himself up to a defamation lawsuit.Just as a reminder, here is what Trump wrote about President Obama on Saturday.Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my  wires tapped  in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!  Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Trump offered absolutely no proof to back up his claims and he still hasn t offered any. FBI Director James Comey and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper have both strongly refuted Trump s claim.The bottom line is that the Constitution absolutely applies here because it would be meaningless if it only applied to the world as it existed in 1787.Featured image via Aude Guerrucci-Pool/Getty Images",0.0
"Venezuela political talks end without deal, new meeting planned Dec. 15","CARACAS (Reuters) - Members of Venezuela s government and opposition coalition failed to reach a deal in a new round of talks in the Dominican Republic on Saturday aimed at resolving the OPEC nation s protracted political crisis, but planned to meet in two weeks to try again. Various mediation efforts have failed in recent years. Foes accuse President Nicolas Maduro of exploiting dialogue to buy time, while he says the opposition prefers violence. Few Venezuelans expect further talks to yield a breakthrough, with Maduro s foes demoralized at seeing him consolidate power ahead of a likely re-election campaign in 2018. The disparate Democratic Unity coalition, which failed to dislodge Maduro in months of street protests earlier this year and then succumbed to infighting, is pressing primarily for a guarantee of free and fair voting next year.  It also wants a foreign humanitarian aid corridor to alleviate one of the worst economic crises in modern history, as well as freedom for several hundred jailed activists and respect for the opposition-led congress.   This process is difficult, heavy, hard and full of debate and confrontation,  said Julio Borges, president of the opposition-led congress, adding he hoped the two sides could come closer on Dec. 15. The government and the opposition did not compromise on any key points, according to one participant in the talks who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to media.  The opposition s bargaining power has been weakened by a surprising defeat in October gubernatorial elections. Furthermore, the multi-party group is divided, with more militant sectors opposing the talks they say simply buy the government more time.  However, debilitating U.S. sanctions against Maduro s government have given his administration more impetus for the talks. Maduro wants any potential deal with the opposition to include joint pressure on Washington to back off.  We said the true aid should come from putting an end to the attacks on Venezuela s economy,  said information minister and government negotiator Jorge Rodriguez, who struck a more positive tone than Borges and said his side was  deeply satisfied  with the two-day talks. There is no indication that U.S. President Donald Trump would be prepared to ease pressure on Maduro, whom he has called  a bad leader who dreams of becoming a dictator.   U.S. officials say Washington could strengthen sanctions unless Maduro enacts democratic changes. Foreign ministers from Chile, Mexico, Bolivia, Nicaragua and host Dominican Republic acted as guarantors at the talks held at the Foreign Ministry building in Santo Domingo. ",1.0
US-UK DIRTY WAR: Latin American-style Death Squads in Iraq Revealed Through Chilcot," Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireThis week another toxic revelation dripped from the Chilcot Report.According to top British SAS officers, US commander Stanley McChrystal s counter-insurgency  black-ops  featured a program of relentless violence designed to  speed up  the process of political cleansing and the so-called  reconstruction  of Iraq.What is so interesting here, is the Chilcot s choice of language, including the term  Latin American-style death squads , which by default implies the United States government was party to war crimes in Central America during the 1980 s   a claim which has always been strenuously denied in public, even though the general public and academia recognizes this to be a self-evident fact of America s long-running ugly history of intervention in that region.The Independent report reveals the level of sheer depravity by US command: The mission was an extraordinary set-up: inside the command centre    The Machine    was the  Death Star , on the walls of which were banks of television screens,  Kill TV , running live pictures of action taking place and surveillance footage in real time from which suspects could be picked out for future arrest or elimination. The Independent also detailed how reckless and violent practices by the US military caused noticeable divisions and splits between joint US-UK command structures and operations, including political tension between British military command.Through the newly created  Office of Special Plans , neoconservatives Paul Wolfowitz and Douglas Feith rolled out their own sub-layer to the US controlled shadow government in Iraq, including the establishment of the  Iraqi De Baathification Council  which, under the supervision of then US Viceroy Paul Bremer, began dismantling the Iraqi military, security and intelligence agency infrastructures of President Saddam Hussein. And so began the process of the Pentagon s  de-Baathification  process in Iraq, immediately followed by a hive of violent  Gangs and Counter-gangs  created by the US and UK covert military and intelligence apparatuses. Front and center in this effort were US operatives John Negroponte and his understudy at the time, Robert Ford, who was later dispatched as US Ambassador to Syria in the run-up to the Syrian Conflict which began in 2011.The legacy of this destructive policy still lingers in Iraq and now in Syria. This unquestionably spawned ISIS and many other terrorist factions in both Iraq and Syria. Only last week, Iraq saw its most deadly car bomb ever, a questionable  sectarian attack  (a narrative not challenged by the western and international press) which killed 200 innocent civilians, and injured many more. GLADIO REDUX: A map of every car bomb in Baghdad since the US-UK invasion in 2003 (Source: Twitter)Prof Michel Chossudovsky explains this same highly disturbing pattern that generally follows every US intervention overseas, be it overt or covert: The recruitment of death squads is part of a well established US military-intelligence agenda. There is a long and gruesome US history of covert funding and support of  terror brigades and targeted assassinations going back to the Vietnam war.   As government forces continue to confront the self-proclaimed  Free Syrian Army  (FSA),  the historical roots of  the West s covert war on Syria  which has resulted in countless atrocities  must be fully revealed.  Once again, we can see the revelation of the US-UK method of not simply instigating wars, but facilitating dirty wars not only overseas, but also at home, as in the case of Operation GLADIO and numerous other false flag events admittedly staged in North America.As 21WIRE will demonstrate in subsequent reports, this latest Chilcot revelation is only the tip of a much larger, covert iceberg RTHowever, kill or capture operations in and around Baghdad, launched from the Balad base 50 miles (80km) north of the city, were a key if little known chapter in Britain s shadow war, the Independent reports.Despite killing or taking as prisoner up to 3,500 insurgents, the mission against the Sunni insurgency caused deep rifts to the point where a senior commander, himself ex-SAS, demanded to know why the UK Special Forces were  helping to run Latin American-style death squads? The mission, under now-famed US General Stanley McChrystal, involved a shift from searching for apparently non-existent weapons of mass destruction (WMD) to man-hunting.Antagonism over the tactics led to UK troops being banned from some operations and a UK SAS commander lodging a complaint with US authorities for talking about British involvement in operations. Another SAS colonel was also ostracized from his regiment after serving under McCrystal.Chilcot does sketch out some of the details of the growing rift, though his report appears to leave out direct references to Special Forces operations. US and UK strategies had, in effect, been on different courses since the UK decision to focus its attention on MND (SE) [Multi-National Division South East, the British run zone] in 2003.As result of this decision, the UK had acquired distinctly different priorities from the US,  the 2.6-million-word report argues.It says the UK was then only  marginally involved in the central tasks of stabilizing the Iraqi government in Baghdad and managing sectarian divisions, while it had come to see its main task in Basra as one of keeping the situation calm while building the case for withdrawal. From that point on, it appears, the US became increasingly concerned that a wavering UK was chiefly focused on getting out of the unpopular war in the best order it could and as soon as possible.In 2006, a former SAS soldier blew the whistle on some of the tactics used in and around Baghdad. Ben Griffin was later gagged by the UK courts for talking about his experiences, but before he was silenced told the Telegraph,  The Americans had this catch-all approach to lifting suspects. The tactics were draconian and completely ineffective. The Americans were doing things like chucking farmers into Abu Ghraib [the notorious prison in Baghdad where US troops abused and tortured Iraqi detainees] or handing them over to the Iraqi authorities, knowing full well they were going to be tortured,  he said at the time.It may be of note that the SAS commander s reference to  Latin American-style deaths squads  appears to ignore the fact that at time of the Iraq war, in July 2003, the UK was itself stepping up training of Colombian paramilitary forces.Commenting on the revelations at the time, human rights NGO Amnesty International warned  the Colombian government has not implemented the UN human rights recommendations and military assistance only gives a green light to the army to carry on as before.

Germany investigates far-right election candidate accused of inciting hatred,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German prosecutors have launched an investigation into remarks  by an election candidate for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party that Germany s integration minister should be  dumped  back to Turkey, her parents  country of origin. The latest polls predict the AfD will win between 8 and 11 percent of the vote in Germany s federal elections on Sept. 24, but Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose conservatives have a 13-point lead over their main rivals, the Social Democrats (SPD), has ruled out any coalition with the party. Alexander Gauland, a co-founder of the AfD who heads the party in the state of Brandenburg, made the comment during a campaign speech there. He is likely to be elected to parliament, surveys show. The AfD has never held any Bundestag seats.  Gauland later conceded that his choice of words was  a little too tough  but repeated that the minister, Aydan Ozoguz,  had no business being in Germany  after she said Germany had no culture beyond its language. Top prosecutor in the town of Muehlhausen, Ulf Walther, said he had launched the investigation after receiving multiple complaints and that he would seek to establish whether Gauland could be charged with  incitement to hatred  over his comment about Ozoguz, who was born in Germany to Turkish parents. Walther said he did not expect the investigation to be completed before the election.  Founded in 2013 as an anti-European Union party, the AfD shifted its focus after the euro zone debt crisis eased off and began to campaign against immigration, fueled by Merkel s decision in 2015 to open Germany s borders to over a million migrants, many fleeing war in the Middle East. But the party has also been hit by a string of scandals and infighting at the top.  Walther s office was able to launch the investigation because Brandenburg did not offer immunity to state legislators like other German states. But he said Gauland would be covered by federal immunity if he wins a seat in the Bundestag. In that case prosecutors would need to seek a waiver of the immunity to proceed with an investigation, he said. Gauland would also get an opportunity to offer his view on the complaints.  Officials in the southern city of Ulm are also reviewing whether AfD election posters displayed in the southern city of Ulm that repeated the call to  dump  Ozoguz constitute slander or  incitement to hatred.

HUMILIATING: Democrats Use RUSSIAN WARSHIPS As Backdrop For Tribute To U.S. VETERANS At DNC,"Maybe Hillary s Russian uranium deal included a cameo of Russian warships on the DNC stage? It certainly wouldn t surprise anyone . On the last night of the Democratic National Convention, a retired Navy four-star took the stage to pay tribute to veterans. Behind him, on a giant screen, the image of four hulking warships reinforced his patriotic message.But there was a big mistake in the stirring backdrop: those are Russian warships.While retired Adm. John Nathman, a former commander of Fleet Forces Command, honored vets as America s best, the ships from the Russian Federation Navy were arrayed like sentinels on the big screen above.These were the very Soviet-era combatants that Nathman and Cold Warriors like him had once squared off against. The ships are definitely Russian,  said noted naval author Norman Polmar after reviewing hi-resolution photos from the event.  There s no question of that in my mind. Naval experts concluded the background was a photo composite of Russian ships that were overflown by what appear to be U.S. trainer jets. It remains unclear how or why the Democratic Party used what s believed to be images of the Russian Black Sea Fleet at their convention.In a new survey of American military personnel, Donald Trump emerged as active-duty service members  preference to become the next U.S. president, topping Hillary Clinton by more than a 2-to-1 margin.  MTA spokesman for the Democratic National Convention Committee was not able to immediately comment Tuesday, saying he had to track down personnel to find out what had happened.The veteran who spotted the error and notified Navy Times said he was immediately taken aback. I was kind of in shock,  said Rob Barker, 38, a former electronics warfare technician who left the Navy in 2006. Having learned to visually identify foreign ships by their radars, Barker recognized the closest ship as the Kara-class cruiser Kerch. An immediate apology [from the committee] would be very nice,  Barker said.  Maybe acknowledge the fact that yes, they screwed up.  Via: Military Times ",0.0

Driver rams German party headquarters in apparent suicide bid,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A man drove a car at the entrance of the Berlin headquarters of Germany s Social Democratic Party (SPD) late on Sunday evening, lightly injuring himself, later telling police that he had intended to commit suicide. Police said the car, which crashed through the first set of glass doors of Willy Brandt House, the SPD s headquarters, was laden with petrol canisters and gas cartridges. The building s sprinkler system extinguished the resulting blaze. Authorities did not identify the man, in part because of a policy of limiting public communications in cases involving suicide, attempted or otherwise, saying only that he was 58 years old. A police spokeswoman said investigators had found nothing to cast doubt on the man s claim that he had been attempting to commit suicide. The incident did not appear to be an attack, she added. It was unclear why he had chosen the SPD, which is about to start negotiations on governing for another four years in coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives, as his target. The man was taken to hospital for treatment for superficial injuries to his head. Nobody else was hurt. Police launched an arson inquiry and state security services were also investigating. ",1.0
Iraq threatens to resume military operations against Kurds,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi forces threatened on Wednesday to resume operations to capture northern Kurdish-held territory after accusing authorities there of delaying handing over control of Iraq s borders with Turkey, Iran and Syria. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Friday declared a pause in an offensive that began on Oct. 16 to take over areas claimed both by his government and the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Abadi ordered economic and military retaliation against the KRG after Iraqi Kurds voted for independence in September in a referendum that Baghdad declared illegal. He said the truce was meant to allow Iraqi troops to deploy without hindrance in the disputed areas and at the international borders. Kurdish officials said on Tuesday they were willing to allow Iraqi  oversight  at the border but said the KRG had to remain in control of crossings into the Kurdish region.  The Iraqi Joint Operations Command accused the KRG of using the talks to  buy time  in order to strengthen Kurdish lines.  During the negotiations, the (Kurdish) region was moving its forces and building new defenses,  the Iraqi statement said.  We will not allow it; the federal forces are mandated to secure (the disputed) areas and borders.  The Kurdish Peshmerga fighters  command accused Iraqi forces of massing weapons and threatening force to resolve  domestic political differences.  Iraq s entire land border with Turkey is located inside the Kurdish autonomous region, and has been controlled by the Kurds since before the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Iraqis troops on Tuesday set up positions between the Turkish and the Iraqi Kurdish checkpoints at the Habur border crossing between the Turkish town of Silopi and the Iraqi town of Zakho. That meant vehicles crossing the border were subject to three checks. Control of the border area is of crucial importance for the landlocked Kurdish region. An oil pipeline runs from northern Iraq into Turkey, carrying crude exports which are the Kurds  in principal source of funds. ",1.0

When I came down, I greeted him, I shook his hand and nothing more. This is called good manners and it is not getting involved in politics, the pope told reporters in answer to a question aboard the plane returning from the Greek island of Lesbos, where he visited a refugee camp. [L5N17J063]. If anyone thinks that greeting someone is getting involved in politics, I recommend that he look for a psychiatrist, he said, laughing. In an interview with ABC News after the meeting, Sanders called the pope a beautiful man, adding I am not a Catholic, but there is a radiance that comes from him. I just conveyed to him my admiration for the extraordinary work he is doing raising some of the most important issues facing our planet and the billions of people on the planet and injecting the need for morality in the global economy, Sanders, a Brooklyn-born son of Polish Jewish immigrants, told ABC. The Democratic hopeful from Vermont has campaigned on a promise to rein in corporate power and level the economic playing field for working and lower-income Americans who he says have been left behind, a message echoing that of the pope. The meeting came just days before Tuesdays Democratic party primary in New York, where polls say he is trailing Hillary Clinton. After he won seven of the last eight state contests, a loss in Sanders home state would give front-runner Clinton a boost toward the partys presidential nomination. Sanders has said the trip was not a pitch for the Catholic vote but a testament to his admiration for the pontiff. ",1.0
"Cuba changing, but only slowly, since Obama's policy shift","HAVANA (Reuters) - Saul Berenthal has waited for decades for a chance to do business in Cuba. Despite the astonishing breakthroughs in U.S.-Cuban relations under President Barack Obama, he must wait some more. Berenthal and business partner Horace Clemmons of Alabama are close to becoming the first U.S. businessmen to manufacture in Cuba with a plan to build low-cost tractors designed for Cuban farms, largely run by private cooperatives. Their project has U.S. approval and Cubas Communist  government has given positive signals about the proposed plant but has yet to bestow permission. Its a little bit of a test of loyalty. Are we willing to go through obstacles to achieve what we believe is a good thing for the Cubans and ourselves? said Berenthal, who was born in Cuba in 1944 and left for the United States as a student in 1960, a year after Fidel Castros revolution. After more than half a century of antagonism between the two countries, Obama has redefined relations with Cuba in the last 15 months, and Cuba is changing. But its leaders are wary of moving too quickly. What is perceived on the outside as slow progress is really the way of Cubans assuring themselves of the trust that is necessary to be built, Berenthal said. Obama arrives in Havana on Sunday for a historic visit that seals a rapprochement he and Cuban President Raul Castro agreed in December 2014 after 18 months of secret negotiations. Since then, Havana has changed noticeably. The number of U.S. visitors soared 77 percent in 2015, swarming hotels and restaurants that have been booked to capacity.  Obama this week issued sweeping regulations to promote even more U.S. travel and trade to Cuba. It was the fifth time he has used executive powers to boost ties with Cuba, sidestepping the Republican-controlled Congress which has refused to lift a 54-year-old economic embargo against the island. Cubas government has yet to fully reciprocate. Cuba did agree to roaming deals with U.S. telecommunications operators and restoring scheduled commercial airline service, two deals that bring more revenue to the government. When it comes to Obamas overtures to the Cubas small but growing private sector, however, the government has been more deliberate. It has yet to accept U.S. sales of farming equipment and construction materials to private businesses, which were authorized by Obama.  Market-style reforms, introduced by Raul Castro in 2011 to update Cubas socialist model, have been implemented haltingly, even reversed in some areas. The government recently attempted restoring price controls on fresh food markets in Havana. Many traits of communism remain. Political dissent is  repressed, commercial property cannot be bought and sold and the government still controls imports and exports.  There is no wholesale market for most private enterprises, forcing shopkeepers to buy inventory at state retail prices or resort to trickery or the black market.  Cuba has already changed, but needs more, said Niuris Higueras, owner of the Atelier restaurant, one of the trendiest spots in Havanas dining scene. She said business grew 50 percent over the past year. We need to link up with the U.S. market, Higueras said. There needs to be more access to U.S. products here in Cuba. We need Home Depot, a Walmart, a Costco. A Restaurant Depot would be fabulous. While the ice has been broken on commerce, Castro insists there will be no change to one-party rule.    U.S.-backed dissidents are still detained for attempting  unauthorized political demonstrations and opponents of Obamas opening to Cuba say he has rewarded Castro without receiving concessions in return. The White House counters that helping stimulate a vibrant private sector is good for ordinary Cubans and offers a more promising path toward political change than the decades-old policy of isolation. While the date of Dec. 17, 2014, marks the most significant turning point in U.S.-Cuban relations, the Obama policy that has so far had most impact on the lives of ordinary Cubans was implemented in 2009, just three months into his presidency. It was then he ordered the lifting of travel restrictions on Cuban-Americans visiting relatives in Cuba and the removal of limits on remittances to relatives on the island. Cuban-Americans can now come and go freely and send as much money as they want to their families. That has financed a boom in small businesses and home repairs and jolted the nascent real estate market. Castros own reforms have also helped grow the private sector. Today some 500,000 Cubans, or 10 percent of the workforce, are registered to work in private businesses, including restaurants, car repair workshops, homes rented out to tourists, beauty parlors and English language schools. Some 70 percent of the 1-million-strong agricultural workforce is private with many Cubans working on state farms that have converted into cooperatives and owning equal stakes in the business.   John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, which has been tracking Cuba for more than 20 years, says the changes have lifted expectations, especially inside the budding middle-class.  There is now additional pressure from within for structural changes to the ideological foundation of the country. Cuba must do more than reform the commercial and economic sectors of the country. It must aggressively redefine the revolution, Kavulich said. While Cuban dissidents and Obamas critics at home prioritize the issue of human rights, others are more concerned about economic growth and better living conditions. No one is talking about the visit in terms of democracy, human rights or the opposition. There is still no culture around freedom of expression, Anaida Gonzalez, a retired nurse in central Camaguey province, said in a telephone interview. People have too many problems in their daily lives. What they want is for their lives to improve and they associate that with the embargo, she said.    Most Cubans live on state salaries that average $25 a month plus a monthly ration card that provides about a weeks worth of food and household supplies. It would be a mistake to assume most Cubans prioritize political questions and are scared to express themselves, said Carlos Alzugaray, a retired Cuban diplomat and professor specializing in U.S.-Cuban relations. They hope to live better. Change, political and economic, is coming to Cuba anyway, but on our own terms. ",1.0
Australia's Turnbull defends 'religious freedom' amid gay marriage poll,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, a strong supporter of gay marriage, defended the right of a church to refuse to marry a young couple who had posted support for same-sex unions on social media.  The minister of a Presbyterian church in the southern state of Victoria told a young couple in their 20s that they would not be allowed to hold their ceremony at the church after the bride posted a message on Facebook supporting same-sex marriage.  Australia is in the midst of a non-compulsory, non-binding poll to inform Parliament on whether it should become the 25th country to legalise same-sex marriage. The issue has threatened to fracture the ruling Liberal-National coalition government.   Churches are free to marry whoever they like,  Turnbull said on Friday in Canberra according to a press conference transcript.  As strongly as I believe in the right of same-sex couples to marry ... Religious freedom is fundamental and it will be protected in any bill that emerges from this Parliament.   Religious freedom in Australia is guaranteed under the constitution. The issue has dogged Prime Minister Turnbull for two years as progressive and conservative members of his ruling coalition have pulled in opposite directions threatening his narrow Parliamentary majority.   Australians have started receiving postal ballots for the poll, which runs until the end of October, and the issue is dividing the country s population of 24 million people along religious and generational lines. Despite securing 70 percent public support in an Ipsos/Fairfax poll, the issue of same-sex marriage had faced a political deadlock, only broken last week when the High Court gave the all-clear for the vote.  Fissures have opened within religions as some churches urge their followers to vote against same-sex marriage, while other churches have taken a neutral stance.  The Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, Australia s largest city, wrote to Sydney Catholic school principals on Friday afternoon, quoting Pope Francis and urging them to oppose the vote. The Bishop of Parramatta, Vincent Long Van Nguyen, however, told his parishioners in a pastoral letter that the vote was a matter of individual conscience.  The Anglican church, which officially opposes gay marriage, has been divided on the issue for years.  ",1.0
 UNPRECEDENTED: FBI Asks DOJ To Confirm Trump Lied About Wiretaps (DETAILS),"Following a series of unhinged tweets from Trump that accuse Obama of illegally spying on him during the election cycle, the intelligence community and the rest of the country have been in an uproar. Many are screaming for him to release his evidence or shut the hell up, and he appears unable to handle the growing scandal around him. But the FBI is doing something else. Director James Comey actually asked the Justice Department to publicly reject Trump s claims.Or, put another way, Comey just asked the DOJ to openly state that Trump lied to the American people.Comey says that the claim is false and must be corrected, and he would know because it was his agency that sought the warrant authorizing wiretapping from the FISA court. The FISA court granted the warrant back in October, after previously refusing to grant it over the summer. Comey is angry because Trump s claims suggest that the FBI broke the law.This is unprecedented   it s the FBI director issuing a public rebuke to a sitting president. The White House, however, isn t backing down because they don t back down on anything. Once Trump says something, the White House goes through all sorts of bizarre gyrations to back him up. We get that it s bad for White House spokespeople, aides and senior staff to contradict their boss, but this is ridiculous. This is something on which they should know better.While the DOJ has yet to actually issue a statement saying anything at all, it seems that this is something Trump can no longer handle. One of the rogue government accounts, Rogue POTUS Staff, says that Trump actually seems to be traumatized by the unfolding scandal   he can t cope with it at all:We re not making light of anything. POTUS seems actually traumatized by recent spate of Russiagate coverage. He can t cope right now.  Rogue POTUS Staff (@RoguePOTUSStaff) March 5, 2017In the end, it doesn t really matter if he s unable to cope with an unfolding scandal the size of Watergate (or big enough to blow Watergate out of the sky). He lied to the public, and the FBI and DOJ both need to publicly say so, along with including the recordings from the taps in their investigations.Photo of James Comey by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.

HOW LEFT- LEANING GOOGLES SECRET DECISIONS COULD CHOOSE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT,"America s next president could be eased into office not just by TV ads or speeches, but by Google s secret decisions, and no one except for me and perhaps a few other obscure researchers would know how this was accomplished.Research I have been directing in recent years suggests that Google, Inc., has amassed far more power to control elections indeed, to control a wide variety of opinions and beliefs than any company in history has ever had. Google s search algorithm can easily shift the voting preferences of undecided voters by 20 percent or more up to 80 percent in some demographic groups with virtually no one knowing they are being manipulated, according to experiments I conducted recently with Ronald E. Robertson.Given that many elections are won by small margins, this gives Google the power, right now, to flip upwards of 25 percent of the national elections worldwide. In the United States, half of our presidential elections have been won by margins under 7.6 percent, and the 2012 election was won by a margin of only 3.9 percent well within Google s control.There are at least three very real scenarios whereby Google perhaps even without its leaders  knowledge could shape or even decide the election next year. Whether or not Google executives see it this way, the employees who constantly adjust the search giant s algorithms are manipulating people every minute of every day. The adjustments they make increasingly influence our thinking including, it turns out, our voting preferences.What we call in our research the Search Engine Manipulation Effect (SEME) turns out to be one of the largest behavioral effects ever discovered. Our comprehensive new study, just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), includes the results of five experiments we conducted with more than 4,500 participants in two countries. Because SEME is virtually invisible as a form of social influence, because the effect is so large and because there are currently no specific regulations anywhere in the world that would prevent Google from using and abusing this technique, we believe SEME is a serious threat to the democratic system of government.According to Google Trends, at this writing Donald Trump is currently trouncing all other candidates in search activity in 47 of 50 states. Could this activity push him higher in search rankings, and could higher rankings in turn bring him more support? Most definitely depending, that is, on how Google employees choose to adjust numeric weightings in the search algorithm. Google acknowledges adjusting the algorithm 600 times a year, but the process is secret, so what effect Mr. Trump s success will have on how he shows up in Google searches is presumably out of his hands.***Our new research leaves little doubt about whether Google has the ability to control voters. In laboratory and online experiments conducted in the United States, we were able to boost the proportion of people who favored any candidate by between 37 and 63 percent after just one search session. The impact of viewing biased rankings repeatedly over a period of weeks or months would undoubtedly be larger.In our basic experiment, participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups in which search rankings favored either Candidate A, Candidate B or neither candidate. Participants were given brief descriptions of each candidate and then asked how much they liked and trusted each candidate and whom they would vote for. Then they were allowed up to 15 minutes to conduct online research on the candidates using a Google-like search engine we created called Kadoodle.Each group had access to the same 30 search results all real search results linking to real web pages from a past election. Only the ordering of the results differed in the three groups. People could click freely on any result or shift between any of five different results pages, just as one can on Google s search engine.When our participants were done searching, we asked them those questions again, and, voil : On all measures, opinions shifted in the direction of the candidate who was favored in the rankings. Trust, liking and voting preferences all shifted predictably.More alarmingly, we also demonstrated this shift with real voters during an actual electoral campaign in an experiment conducted with more than 2,000 eligible, undecided voters throughout India during the 2014 Lok Sabha election there the largest democratic election in history, with more than 800 million eligible voters and 480 million votes ultimately cast. Even here, with real voters who were highly familiar with the candidates and who were being bombarded with campaign rhetoric every day, we showed that search rankings could boost the proportion of people favoring any candidate by more than 20 percent more than 60 percent in some demographic groups.Given how powerful this effect is, it s possible that Google decided the winner of the Indian election. Google s own daily data on election-related search activity (subsequently removed from the Internet, but not before my colleagues and I downloaded the pages) showed that Narendra Modi, the ultimate winner, outscored his rivals in search activity by more than 25 percent for sixty-one consecutive days before the final votes were cast. That high volume of search activity could easily have been generated by higher search rankings for Modi.Google s official comment on SEME research is always the same:  Providing relevant answers has been the cornerstone of Google s approach to search from the very beginning. It would undermine the people s trust in our results and company if we were to change course. Could any comment be more meaningless? How does providing  relevant answers  to election-related questions rule out the possibility of favoring one candidate over another in search rankings? Google s statement seems far short of a blanket denial that it ever puts its finger on the scales.There are three credible scenarios under which Google could easily be flipping elections worldwide as you read this:First, there is the Western Union ScenarioGoogle s executives decide which candidate is best for us and for the company, of course and they fiddle with search rankings accordingly. There is precedent in the United States for this kind of backroom king-making. Rutherford B. Hayes, the 19th president of the United States, was put into office in part because of strong support by Western Union. In the late 1800s, Western Union had a monopoly on communications in America, and just before the election of 1876, the company did its best to assure that only positive news stories about Hayes appeared in newspapers nationwide. It also shared all the telegrams sent by his opponent s campaign staff with Hayes s staff. Perhaps the most effective way to wield political influence in today s high-tech world is to donate money to a candidate and then to use technology to make sure he or she wins. The technology guarantees the win, and the donation guarantees allegiance, which Google has certainly tapped in recent years with the Obama administration.Given Google s strong ties to Democrats, there is reason to suspect that if Google or its employees intervene to favor their candidates, it will be to adjust the search algorithm to favor Hillary Clinton. In 2012, Google and its top executives donated more than $800,000 to Obama but only $37,000 to Romney. At least six top tech officials in the Obama administration, including Megan Smith, the country s chief technology officer, are former Google employees. According to a recent report by the Wall Street Journal, since Obama took office, Google representatives have visited the White House ten times as frequently as representatives from comparable companies once a week, on average.Hillary Clinton clearly has Google s support and is well aware of Google s value in elections. In April of this year, she hired a top Google executive, Stephanie Hannon, to serve as her chief technology officer. I don t have any reason to suspect Hannon would use her old connections to aid her candidate, but the fact that she or any other individual with sufficient clout at Google has the power to decide elections threatens to undermine the legitimacy of our electoral system, particularly in close elections.This is, in any case, the most implausible scenario. What company would risk the public outrage and corporate punishment that would follow from being caught manipulating an election? Second, there is the Marius Milner ScenarioA rogue employee at Google who has sufficient password authority or hacking skills makes a few tweaks in the rankings (perhaps after receiving a text message from some old friend who now works on a campaign), and the deed is done. In 2010, when Google got caught sweeping up personal information from unprotected Wi-Fi networks in more than 30 countries using its Street View vehicles, the entire operation was blamed on one Google employee: software engineer Marius Milner. So they fired him, right? Nope. He s still there, and on LinkedIn he currently identifies his profession as  hacker.  If, somehow, you have gotten the impression that at least a few of Google s 37,000 employees are every bit as smart as Milner and possess a certain mischievousness well, you are probably right, which is why the rogue employee scenario isn t as far-fetched as it might seem. And third and this is the scariest possibility there is the Algorithm ScenarioUnder this scenario, all of Google s employees are innocent little lambs, but the software is evil. Google s search algorithm is pushing one candidate to the top of rankings because of what the company coyly dismisses as  organic  search activity by users; it s harmless, you see, because it s all natural. Under this scenario, a computer program is picking our elected officials.To put this another way, our research suggests that no matter how innocent or disinterested Google s employees may be, Google s search algorithm, propelled by user activity, has been determining the outcomes of close elections worldwide for years, with increasing impact every year because of increasing Internet penetration. SEME is powerful precisely because Google is so good at what it does; its search results are generally superb. Having learned that fact over time, we have come to trust those results to a high degree. We have also learned that higher rankings mean better material, which is why 50 percent of our clicks go to the first two items, with more than 90 percent of all clicks going to that precious first search page. Unfortunately, when it comes to elections, that extreme trust we have developed makes us vulnerable to manipulation.In the final days of a campaign, fortunes are spent on media blitzes directed at a handful of counties where swing voters will determine the winners in the all-important swing states. What a waste of resources! The right person at Google could influence those key voters more than any stump speech could; there is no cheaper, more efficient or subtler way to turn swing voters than SEME. SEME also has one eerie advantage over billboards: when people are unaware of a source of influence, they believe they weren t being influenced at all; they believe they made up their own minds.Republicans, take note: A manipulation on Hillary Clinton s behalf would be particularly easy for Google to carry out, because of all the demographic groups we have looked at so far, no group has been more vulnerable to SEME in other words, so blindly trusting of search rankings than moderate Republicans. In a national experiment we conducted in the United States, we were able to shift a whopping 80 percent of moderate Republicans in any direction we chose just by varying search rankings.There are many ways to influence voters more ways than ever these days, thanks to cable television, mobile devices and the Internet. Why be so afraid of Google s search engine? If rankings are so influential, won t all the candidates be using the latest SEO techniques to make sure they rank high?SEO is competitive, as are billboards and TV commercials. No problem there. The problem is that for all practical purposes, there is just one search engine. More than 75 percent of online search in the United States is conducted on Google, and in most other countries that proportion is 90 percent. That means that if Google s CEO, a rogue employee or even just the search algorithm itself favors one candidate, there is no way to counteract that influence. It would be as if Fox News were the only television channel in the country. As Internet penetration grows and more people get their information about candidates online, SEME will become an increasingly powerful form of influence, which means that the programmers and executives who control search engines will also become more powerful.Worse still, our research shows that even when people do notice they are seeing biased search rankings, their voting preferences still shift in the desired directions even more than the preferences of people who are oblivious to the bias. In our national study in the United States, 36 percent of people who were unaware of the rankings bias shifted toward the candidate we chose for them, but 45 percent of those who were aware of the bias also shifted. It s as if the bias was serving as a form of social proof; the search engine clearly prefers one candidate, so that candidate must be the best. (Search results are supposed to be biased, after all; they re supposed to show us what s best, second best, and so on.)Biased rankings are hard for individuals to detect, but what about regulators or election watchdogs? Unfortunately, SEME is easy to hide. The best way to wield this type of influence is to do what Google is becoming better at doing every day: send out customized search results. If search results favoring one candidate were sent only to vulnerable individuals, regulators and watchdogs would be especially hard pressed to find them.For the record, by the way, our experiments meet the gold standards of research in the behavioral sciences: They are randomized (which means people are randomly assigned to different groups), controlled (which means they include groups in which interventions are either present or absent), counterbalanced (which means critical details, such as names, are presented to half the participants in one order and to half in the opposite order) and double-blind (which means that neither the subjects nor anyone who interacts with them has any idea what the hypotheses are or what groups people are assigned to). Our subject pools are diverse, matched as closely as possible to characteristics of a country s electorate. Finally, our recent report in PNAS included four replications; in other words, we showed repeatedly under different conditions and with different groups that SEME is real.Our newest research on SEME, conducted with nearly 4,000 people just before the national elections in the UK this past spring, is looking at ways we might be able to protect people from the manipulation. We found the monster; now we re trying to figure out how to kill it. What we have learned so far is that the only way to protect people from biased search rankings is to break the trust Google has worked so hard to build. When we deliberately mix rankings up, or when we display various kinds of alerts that identify bias, we can suppress SEME to some extent.It s hard to imagine Google ever degrading its product and undermining its credibility in such ways, however. To protect the free and fair election, that might leave only one option, as unpalatable as it might seem: government regulation.Authored by Robert Epstein (@DrREpstein   senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology), originally posted at Politico.com Via: Zero Hedge",0.0
"Ship carrying migrants sinks off Turkish coast, kills 15 - coast guard","ANKARA (Reuters) - Fifteen people drowned when a fishing boat carrying migrants sank off the Turkish coast in the Marmara Sea on Friday and up to 15 more were missing, Turkey s coast guard said. The boat sank off the northwestern province of Kocaeli shortly after calling for help, the coast guard said in a statement. Forty migrants were rescued from the sea so far and teams were still searching for another 13 to 15 people, it said. The search effort included two helicopters, as well as planes and commercial boats. The state-run Anadolu news agency said the rescued migrants were brought back to Kocaeli, where they were treated at a make-shift hospital at the dock. It said two of the injured were transferred to a hospital in the city. Their origin and destination were not immediately clear. Turkey agreed with the European Union to help curb a flood of illegal migrants - many of them passing through Turkey or its waters - on the way to Europe. While that has helped significantly reduce the illegal flow to Europe, some migrants still risk their lives trying to make the perilous voyage. But there are fears that deteriorating relations between Europe and Turkey could endanger the deal, under which Ankara is supposed to receive 3 billion euros in financial aid and visa-free travel for Turks to Europe. Turkey says the European Union has yet to fulfil its end of the bargain and has warned it could re-evaluate or suspend all of the agreement. ",1.0
Rebel area near Damascus hit by heavy shelling despite two-day truce,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Dozens of mortar bombs landed on the last major rebel stronghold near the Syrian capital Damascus on Wednesday, a war monitor and a witness said on Wednesday, despite a 48 hour truce proposed by Russia to coincide with the start of peace talks in Geneva. After a relatively calm morning, shelling picked up later in the day, accompanied by ground attempts to storm the besieged enclave, a witness in the Eastern Ghouta area told Reuters. The Syrian army stepped up bombardment two weeks ago in an effort to recapture Eastern Ghouta, a rebel-held pocket of densely populated agricultural land on the outskirts of the capital under siege since 2012. Scores of people have been killed in air strikes during the offensive, and residents say they are on the verge of starvation after the siege was tightened. Russia had proposed a ceasefire on Monday in the besieged area for Nov. 28-29. U.N. Syria envoy Staffan De Mistura later said Russia had told him that the Syrian government had accepted the idea, but  we have to see if it happens . The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least one person was killed when dozens of mortars crashed into Eastern Ghouta on Wednesday. Eastern Ghouta is one of several  de-escalation  zones across western Syria where Russia has brokered ceasefire deals between rebels and President Bashar al-Assad s government. But fighting has continued there. On Tuesday, shelling killed three people and injured 15, but was less intense than in previous days, the observatory said. It had reported intense bombardment that killed 41 people over two days from Sunday to Monday.  A two-day truce is not nearly enough for civilians facing grave violations of international law - including bombardment and besiegement - but it is a window of opportunity to save the lives of the most desperately in need of treatment,  said Thomas Garofalo, International Rescue Committee s Middle East Public Affairs Director, in a statement on Wednesday. The Syrian delegation arrived in Geneva to participate in the eighth round of United Nation-sponsored peace talks. It delayed its departure for one day after the opposition repeated its demand that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad step down. Nasr Hariri, head of the opposition delegation, told a Geneva news conference on Monday night that he is aiming for Assad s removal as a result of negotiations. The government delegation will be headed by Syria s U.N. ambassador and chief negotiator Bashar al-Ja afari, state-run news agency SANA said. A breakthrough in the talks is seen as unlikely as Assad and his allies push for total military victory in Syria s civil war, now in its seventh year, and his opponents stick by their demand he leaves power.

Australian medical group wants access to Manus Island asylum seekers,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia s main medical association called on Saturday for the government to allow independent doctors and other health experts to help more than 400 asylum seekers languishing inside a recently closed detention center in Papua New Guinea. The asylum seekers have shut themselves inside the Australian-run Manus Island Centre for the past 18 days, defying attempts by Australia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) to close it in a standoff the United Nations describes as a  looming humanitarian crisis . Australia has shut access to the center, and staff, including doctors, have left, leaving the men without sufficient food, clean water, power or medical care. Members of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) voted unanimously on Saturday to call on the government to grant access to the center so doctors could assess the men s health, wellbeing and living conditions.  The AMA has made many representations on this matter, both publicly and in private but, with a worsening and more dangerous situation emerging on Manus, the federal council strongly believes that urgent action and answers are needed,  AMA President Michael Gannon said.  It is our responsibility as a nation with a strong human rights record to ensure that we look after the health and wellbeing of these men, and provide them with safe and hygienic living conditions.  Government spokesmen were not immediately available for comment. Australia s  sovereign borders  immigration policy, under which it refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores, has been heavily criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups but has bipartisan political support in Australia. The 421 asylum seekers on Manus island say they fear violent reprisals from the community if they move to transit centers, pending possible resettlement to the United States. Sudanese refugee Abdul Aziz said via text message on Saturday that PNG officials had started to dismantle the center s perimeter fences and food was running low.  We are waiting drinking from the rainwater ... it s tense feeling, we don t have any idea what PNG will do to us. Their attitude toward us they are really aggressive,  Aziz said. PNG s Supreme Court ruled last year that the center breached its laws and fundamental human rights, leading to the decision to close it. New Zealand has offered to accept 150 of the men, but Australia has declined the offer saying the priority was an existing refugee swap deal negotiated with former U.S. President Barack Obama last year.   Under that deal, up to 1,250 asylum seekers could be sent to the United States and Australia will in turn accept refugees from Central America. ",1.0

"North Korea hacked Daewoo Shipbuilding, took warship blueprints: South Korea lawmaker"," SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea probably stole South Korean warship blueprints after hacking into Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co Ltd s (042660.KS) database in April last year, a South Korean opposition lawmaker said on Tuesday.  North Korea has often been implicated in cyber attacks in South Korea and elsewhere but Pyongyang has either ignored or denied accusations of hacking.   We are almost 100 percent certain that North Korean hackers were behind the hacking and stole the company s sensitive documents,  Kyung Dae-soo of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party told Reuters by telephone.  Daewoo Shipbuilding has built several South Korean warships, including an Aegis-class vessel and submarines. It was most likely North Korea had obtained blueprints for these, he said.  The hacking was discovered by a division under South Korea s Ministry of Defence in charge of investigating cases of cybercrime, said Kyung, who received a briefing on the investigation.  How sensitive and classified the seized documents were was not known as that was not disclosed by the investigative team, he added.  A spokeswoman for Daewoo Shipbuilding said she was unaware of the issue until early Tuesday and the company was in the process of confirming the details of Kyung s remarks.  The investigative team came to the conclusion North Korea had hacked Daewoo Shipbuilding because the hacking method was very similar to other attacks that North Korea was thought to be behind, Kyung said.  Hackers in North Korea are believed to have been responsible for a recent cyber heist in Taiwan - the latest in a string of hacks targeting the global SWIFT messaging system.  Earlier this month, another South Korean lawmaker had said North Korean hackers had stolen a large number of classified military documents, including South Korea-U.S. wartime operational plans.

"Somalia's capital restricts movement of trucks, tankers after attacks","MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Somali authorities imposed a daytime ban on Monday on the movement of large trucks and road tankers inside the capital Mogadishu in an attempt to improve security following a wave of devastating attacks by militants. The move followed twin truck bombings on Oct. 15 that killed more than 350 people in the city, in the deadliest attack in the history of the Horn of Africa nation. Though the Islamist militant group al Shabaab did not claim responsibility for that attack, the method is one it has often used.  Trucks and tankers cannot pass ... from 7:00 am to 8:00 pm. This is to ensure security and (to offer) a solution to the complaints of the public,  Tabid Abdi, the capital s mayor, said in a statement.  Any truck or tanker driver who does not comply will be fined $1,000.   Further underlining the Somali capital s security woes, at least 29 people were killed on Sunday during a 12-hour siege at a Mogadishu hotel, in an attack claimed by al Shabaab. The government sacked two top security officials.  They had the uniforms of security forces, even though they did not have ID cards,  Information Minister Abdirahman Omar Osman told Reuters. Al Shabaab said 40 people had been killed, including three of its fighters who stormed the hotel. Al Shabaab aims to topple the government in Mogadishu and impose its own strict interpretation of Islam. The country has been at war since 1991, when clan-based warlords overthrew dictator Siad Barre and then turned on each other. Though it has lost large swathes of territory to African Union peacekeepers, the group s attacks have grown in frequency and size, as a 22,000-strong peacekeeping force prepares to begin withdrawing.

HOLY CASH COW! Check Out How Much Wall Street Funneled Into HILLARYs Foundation/Slush Fund,"Thank God she has a vagina, otherwise her blatant hypocrisy might be an issue with voters Hillary Clinton is facing more questions about her close ties to Wall Street financial institutions. Last week, the New York Times urged Clinton to release transcripts of her highly-compensated speeches to Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs.The paid speeches are just a slim chapter of her relationship with financial titans. According to Clinton Foundation records, Wall Street financial institutions have donated around $40 million to the eponymous family foundation.As a non-profit, the Clinton Foundation isn t legally required to disclose its donors or contributions. The Foundation has publicly disclosed some contributions on its website. It only provides ranges for contributions, e.g. $1-5 million, and doesn t detail when the contribution was made or for what purpose, if any.Here s the chart of contributions from Wall Street to the Clinton Foundation.All together, contributions from readily identifiable Wall Street institutions to the Foundation total somewhere between $11 million and $41 million in contributions. If we assume the donations fall in the middle of the ranges disclosed by the Clinton Foundation, the contributions would total just under $30 million.As with most things involving the Clintons, the devil is in the details. This total of contributions does not include those made by individuals with strong Wall Street ties. It also does not necessarily represent the total amounts contributed to the Foundation from those donors listed. It only accounts for the donations which the Foundation has chosen to disclose.The failure of the Foundation to include any information on the timing of the donations is especially worrisome. In terms of donor relationships, there is a real difference between a one-time gift of $1 million and an ongoing gift of $200,000 for 5 straight years. The total dollar amount may be the same, but an ongoing gift usually requires a more substantive relationship between the Foundation and the donor.There is, of course, an added dimension to the timing issue with the Clintons. During the life of the Foundation, Hillary Clinton has been a US Senator, Secretary of State and two-time candidate for President.When the Clinton Foundation discloses that the  Friends of Saudi Arabia  contributed $1-5 million, it begs the obvious question of when that donation was made. The specific date of that donation is particularly important, given Clinton s considerable focus on the Middle East while she was Secretary of State.It is also important to note that these contributions are completely seperate from the paid speeches made by Bill and Hillary Clinton. In 2013 alone, Hillary earned just over $3 million in paid speeches to financial firms and institutions.These contributions, obviously, also don t include direct contributions made by Wall Street institutions and individuals to either of Clinton s Presidential campaigns.For entire story: Breitbart News",0.0

China probes former chief of internet regulator for suspected graft,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The former head of China s powerful internet regulator is under investigation for suspected corruption, the ruling Communist Party said, the latest senior official to be caught up in a sweeping campaign against graft. Lu Wei was suspected of serious discipline breaches, the party s corruption-busting Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) said in a brief statement late on Tuesday, using a euphemism for graft. Reuters was unable to reach Lu or a representative to seek comment. At the height of his influence, Lu, a colorful and often brash official by Chinese standards, was seen as emblematic of China s increasingly pervasive internet controls.  Organizers of China s first World Internet Conference in 2014, set up under Lu to promote Beijing s vision of internet governance, irked foreign tech firms by seeking their agreement on a last-minute declaration on  internet sovereignty .  Tech industry representatives ultimately declined to sign the pledge, and rights groups condemned the declaration as an attempt to undermine internet freedom. In 2015, he told reporters,  Indeed, we do not welcome those that make money off China, occupy China s market, even as they slander China s people. These kinds of websites I definitely will not allow in my house.  But courting China s powerful internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, was a key task for companies hoping to stay in his good graces or gain access to the huge internet market. When Lu visited Facebook Inc s U.S. campus in 2014, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of the social networking site that has long been blocked in China, greeted Lu in Mandarin, according to a Chinese government website. But Lu s downfall, foreshadowed by his June 2016 replacement as head of the internet regulator and the loss of his other posts, is unlikely to signal a reversal of internet control policies, which have tightened further under successor Xu Lin. In a separate statement on its website on Wednesday, the CCDI emphasized the significance of Lu being the first  tiger , or senior official, to be brought to heel for corruption since the key 19th Communist Party Congress held last month. It said that under Lu, the cyberspace administration did not carry out President Xi Jinping s instructions in a timely or resolute fashion.  The improper use of power occurred on occasion, and the safeguarding of political security was not strong enough,  it said, without elaborating on any of Lu s specific wrongdoings.       Lu worked his way up though China s official Xinhua news agency before becoming head of propaganda in Beijing and then moving to internet work in 2013. He became a deputy propaganda minister after being replaced at the internet regulator.  The government has blocked sites it deems could challenge Communist Party rule or threaten stability, including sites such as Facebook and Google s main search engine and Gmail service. Xi has waged war against deep-rooted corruption since taking office five years ago, punishing hundreds of thousands of officials. ",1.0
Syrian refugees should return to calmer areas: Lebanon president,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon can no longer handle vast numbers of Syrian refugees, its president said on Monday, urging world powers to help them return to the calmer parts of their war-torn homeland. More than six years into the Syrian war, 1.5 million refugees who fled the violence now account for a quarter of Lebanon s population.  Lebanese President Michel Aoun told international envoys he wanted to find ways for them to return safely but would not force people back to places where they could face persecution.  My country cannot handle it anymore,  Aoun told  representatives of the European Union, the Arab League and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council at a meeting in Beirut, his media office said. The long-term presence of refugees is a particularly sensitive issue in Lebanon where some politicians say the influx of mainly Sunni Syrians might destabilize the delicate sectarian balance with Christians, Shi ite Muslims and others.  As the Syrian government regains more territory from rebels and militants, calls have increased in Lebanon for Syrians to return. A series of ceasefire deals has reduced fighting to some extent in parts of western Syria.  But rights groups have warned against forcing people back to a country still at war, and refugees have often said they fear facing arrest or conscription into the army.  The U.N. refugee agency does not yet consider Syria safe for refugee to return  to. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri has said there can be no forced returns.  Aoun told the envoys there were parts of Syria not currently at war and territory where calm has returned, a spokesman said.   The return of displaced to stable and low-tension areas must be carried out without attaching it to reaching a political solution,  the president s Twitter account said.  Aoun said it was in the everyone s interest to solve the refugee crisis so that political, economic and social problems in Lebanon do not get out of hand.  Officials at the meeting thanked Lebanon for its generosity in hosting refugees.  They expressed their full understanding of the concerns that are being voiced,  a statement from the envoys said.   A return of refugees to their country of origin must take place in safety, dignity and voluntarily, in accordance with principles of international law,  it said. ",1.0

Kept a secret for months   no small task in Hollywood    Funny or Die Presents Donald Trump s The Art of the Deal: The Movie  was released to coincide with Mr. Trump s victory on Tuesday in the New Hampshire Republican presidential primary. It was a crazy, completely nuts idea that somehow we pulled off,  said Adam McKay, a co-founder of Funny or Die, which also counts Will Ferrell and Judd Apatow as principal partners and produces exclusive material that often features well-known stars. Mr. McKay, the director of  The Big Short,  which is a contender for best picture at the coming Academy Awards, added that the site s newest skewering of Mr. Trump will  with any luck  annoy the presidential hopeful.According to the movie s own mythology, told in narration by director Ron Howard, Trump himself made the movie in the 1980s as writer/producer/director but he angrily ordered it into a vault after a football game went into overtime.In addition to Depp, many other notable actors appear in the movie including Johnny Depp, Ron Howard, Alfred Molina, Robert Morse, Patton Oswalt, Jack McBrayer, Henry Winkler, Stephen Merchant, Christopher Lloyd, Kristen Schaal, Andy Richter, Paul Scheer, Rob Huebel, Tymberlee Hill, Alf, Jordan Coleman, Joe Nu ez, and Jeremy Konner.

"Defying Trump, Iran says will boost missile capabilities","LONDON (Reuters) - Iran will strengthen its missile capabilities and not seek any country s permission, President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday rejecting demands from U.S. President Donald Trump.  Rouhani spoke at a military parade where an Iranian news agency said one of the weapons on display was a new ballistic missile with range of 2,000 km (1,200 miles), capable of carrying several warheads. The Tasnim news agency, which quoted the head of the Revolutionary Guards  aerospace division, Amirali Hajizadeh, gave few other details of the missile. Iranian state television showed footage of the firing of  Khoramshahr missile  but did not specify if the test-fire happened on Friday or in the past. At the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, Trump said Iran was building its missile capability and accused it exporting violence to Yemen, Syria and other parts of the Middle East. He also criticized the 2015 pact that the United States and six other powers struck with Iran under which Tehran agreed to restrict its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions. In a speech broadcast on state television, Rouhani said:  We will increase our military power as a deterrent. We will strengthen our missile capabilities ... We will not seek permission from anyone to defend our country.  All countries in the world supported the nuclear deal in the United Nations General Assembly this year ... except the United States and the Zionist regime (Israel),  Rouhani said. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said that the agreement must be changed or the United States could not stick with it. Iran has said its nuclear accord cannot be renegotiated. The prospect of Washington reneging on the deal has worried some of the U.S. allies that helped negotiate it, especially as the world grapples with North Korea s nuclear and ballistic missile development. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said tensions on the Korean peninsula underlined the importance of the Iranian deal, and that China would continue to support it. Trump put Iran  on notice  in February for test-firing a ballistic missile and imposed new economic sanctions in July over its missile program and  malign activities  in the Middle East. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday that the U.S. imposition of unilateral sanctions on Iran was  illegitimate and undermines the collective nature of international efforts.

SHOCKING COMMENTS: Hillary Stirs The Pot Inciting More Racial Divide With More Lies,"Hillary Clinton used a CNN interview on Friday to completely embrace the Democrats  claim that white people and cops must change to help reduce the number of African-Americans killed in tense exchanges with cops.   BREITBART NEWSLet s face it, Hillary needs votes from the black community come November. What better way to do it than to continue the false narrative that Obama has been using for so long.The facts are just too inconvenient for the black community and the politicians who pander for their votes. The truth is never spoken for fear of being called a  racist  or for fear of losing votes.  The black community needs some tough love and that involves honesty. Here s a bit of truth that Hillary and Obama choose to ignore:African-American communities have a role in reducing police-encounter deaths, which usually occur in tense engagements between a few cops and a few suspects with extensive criminal histories.In general, young African-American men are far more likely to commit crimes than young white men, young Asian men or young Latino men. A November 2011 report by the Justice Department showed that young African-American men are just 1 percent of the population, yet are responsible for a disproportionate percentage of murders in the nation.Clinton suggested that people who disagree with her agenda are racists.  There is so much more to be done  we can t be engaging in hateful rhetoric or incitement of violence, we need to be bringing people together   we need more love and kindness. White Americans need to do a better job of listening when African Americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers you face every day.- Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) July 8, 2016Hillary Clinton used a CNN interview on Friday to completely embrace the Democrats  claim that white people and cops must change to help reduce the number of African-Americans killed in tense exchanges with cops.

 Trump Fan WILLFULLY Gives Reporter Kurt Eichenwald Epileptic Seizure  Deplorables CHEER (TWEETS),"Newsweek s Kurt Eichenwald, who also serves as a senior editor at Vanity Fair and goes hard at conservatives in his reporting, is an avid Twitter user.

Is the best of 'lucky general' Macron's good fortune behind him?,"PARIS (Reuters) - During his rapid rise to the presidency, France s Emmanuel Macron was sometimes referred to as a  lucky general    a leader with the right skills for the job but also a generous dose of the good fortune needed to win the day.  The 39-year-old certainly took advantage of a string of lucky breaks, especially a corruption scandal that derailed the campaign of front-running, center-right rival Francois Fillon. But six months into his occupation of the Elysee Palace, there are niggling signs Macron s luck could be starting to turn. In particular, the uncertain political picture in Germany has complicated his ambition to reform Europe s single currency zone, something he has put at the heart of his presidency and that stands or falls on Franco-German cooperation. And while changes he introduced early on to France s employment rules provoked less unrest than expected, the impact on the economy has so far been muted. His plans to amend the  pensions and benefits system may not be so readily accepted.  From a fiscal point of view, one of his main objectives is to bring the national deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product for the first time in a decade. Yet current indications are that he will struggle with that goal, leaving France at odds with the EU s executive Commission. And within his own party   En Marche, formed as a grassroots movement a little over a year ago   there is unease among some members about a top-down structure that goes against the ethos that propelled him to a five-year term in May. Some breaks continue to fall in Macron s favor. France last week won the right to host the European Banking Agency in a lucky dip against Dublin, and domestically he faces little serious opposition from either the left or right. But his biggest ambitions rely on a deep and sustained relationship with Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose position after 12 years as Germany s leader has been weakened over two months of so-far fruitless talks to form a governing coalition.  We are naturally paying close attention to everything that might help stabilize the political situation (in Germany),  Benjamin Griveaux, a close Macron ally who was recently named the government s new spokesman, said on Monday.   Without a strong partner it will obviously be more difficult to carry out the president s ambitious European project.   At one level, the fact that Merkel is now talking to Germany s Social Democrats (SPD) about a  grand coalition , after overtures to the Liberals and Greens failed, is positive for Macron since the SPD is more avowedly pro-EU. But there s no guarantee the SPD will sign up to Macron s agenda, even if its leader, Martin Schulz, is a former European Parliament president who is committed to the project. Schulz has only gone as far as to say Macron s ideas need to be discussed in coalition talks with Merkel, while other SPD officials say domestic reforms to health insurance and pensions are a more pressing consideration.  Europe is not a theme where we can simply push things through,  said Johannes Kahrs, a budget expert for the SPD in parliament and leader of the party s conservative wing. Macron s ideas for overhauling the euro zone, including the creation of a region-wide budget, finance minister and separate parliament, may be just too ambitious for Germany to swallow.  It would be nice if the conservatives went along with the idea of a budget for the euro zone, but they need to want it,  said Kahrs.  It would make no sense to try to bully them.     Even as he focuses on his grand ambitions, Macron and his finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, must battle to get the state s historically overstretched finances in order, while hoping that France s currently steady growth rate doesn t falter. The budget deficit has been falling and should dip just below 3 percent next year, but from the European Commission s point of view that is insufficient. It wants more done on the structural deficit, which strips out the business cycle.  If Macron and Le Maire are to achieve more, it will likely mean cutting deeper into regional budgets, where planned reductions have already provoked anger among mayors.  Unemployment figures show job creation is at a record high but the jobless rate still ticked higher in the third quarter, rising to 9.7 percent. While it is forecast to decline again, the French rate remains way above Germany s of 5.6 percent. Jean Pisani-Ferry, a leading economist and former adviser to Macron, believes perhaps the biggest risk Macron faces is ensuring his European strategy pays off, because his domestic agenda will in large part be influenced by it in turn. Yet that depends a lot on Germany, and the wider EU.  He s making a huge political investment (in Europe),  said Pisani-Ferry, a professor of economics and public management at Sciences Po university.  And if you re making a huge political investment, you want at some point some pay-off.    If there is no pay-off whatsoever, then obviously there will be domestic political consequences. It will be a setback for him.  ",1.0
Ousted Catalan leader calls for united front for independence,"MADRID/BARCELONA (Reuters) - Ousted Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont called on Saturday for a united political front in the Dec. 21 election to continue the drive for independence from Spain and to protest against the imprisonment of former members of the regional government.  Puigdemont, who went to Belgium after his government was fired following a unilateral declaration of independence, said on Friday he was considering standing in the election from Brussels. In Spain s gravest political crisis since the return of democracy in the late 1970s, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called the snap election after taking control of Catalonia a week ago. Political parties that wish to run on a common platform have until Tuesday to register any potential coalition and until Nov. 18 to put forward their candidates.     It is time for all democrats to join together. For Catalonia, for the freedom of political prisoners and for the republic,  Puigdemont said in a tweet that included the hashtag llistaunitaria.cat, a site calling for parties to unite against the Spanish government at the ballot box. Signatures on the website rose to over 40,000 from just 2,000 within a few hours of Puigdemont s tweet.  In a poll published on Tuesday, the pro-independence coalition Junts pel Si (Together for Yes) was seen winning with 35.2 percent if the vote was held immediately. That would return a parliamentary majority to independence supporters if the group stuck with its current pact with far-left party CUP.      The wealthy northeastern region continues to be evenly split between those that support leaving Spain and those that wish to remain part of the country, according to polls taken since the declaration of independence.  If pro-independence parties run on different tickets, it may be difficult for them to win a parliamentary majority, though the imprisonment of former government members may help unite an electorate already wary of Madrid s tactics, seen by many as heavy-handed. Pro-Spain candidates including Rajoy s People s Party (PP), the Socialists and market-friendly Ciudadanos were out canvassing on Saturday with modest rallies in the region calling for the so-called silent majority to vote en masse in December. Ines Arrimadas, the head of regional opposition Ciudadanos, called for anti-independence parties to join together on Tuesday. She singled out the Socialists and Podemos-associated Catalunya Si Que Es Pot to clarify if they would run with the independence party ERC in the election. The ERC general secretary Marta Rovira said on Saturday the party may shun the elections if the politicians jailed pending trial over the independence bid were not freed before the vote.   It is up to the state to show it s democratic. Let the prisoners go free so they can take part in the elections normally,  she said.  On Thursday, nine members of Puigdemont s sacked cabinet were ordered by Spain s High Court to be held on remand pending an investigation and potential trial. One member of the dismissed cabinet, Santi Vila, was released after paying bail of 50,000 euros ($58,000) on Friday. The other eight could remain in custody for up to four years. On Friday, Spain issued an arrest warrant for Puigdemont and  four associates to answer charges of rebellion, sedition, misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust relating to their secessionist campaign. Catalan civic groups Asamblea Nacional Catalana and Omnium Cultural - whose leaders were imprisoned last month on sedition charges - have called for a general strike on Nov. 8 and a mass demonstration on Nov. 11 to protest against the detentions. Puigdemont has said he would not return to Spain until he has been given unspecified  guarantees  by the Spanish government. Following the warrant, any extradition process could take 45 days, though this could be extended up to 90 days.  Puigdemont reiterated on Saturday in a tweet that he would fully cooperate with Belgian justice following the warrant.  Asked if he would detain Puigdemont on Saturday, Belgian prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt said it was unlikely.  Tomorrow, or it could be possible on Monday,  he said.  We are not in a hurry. He said he would collaborate. We don t have any reason to believe he will flee. We are going to do this thoroughly.   While anti-independence parties urged Catalans to go out and vote in the December election, the arrests helped fuel the antagonism felt by many in the region toward the central government in Madrid.   To pick someone up and arrest them is not politics. Politics is talking, discussing. To arrest some, it seems to me a little bit like a fascist government,  Barcelona resident Cristiano Gonzalez, 34, said.  ($1 = 0.8615 euros) ",1.0
Trump faces dilemma as U.S. oil reels from record biofuels targets,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Obama administration signed its final plan for renewable fuel use in the United States last week, leaving an oil industry reeling from the most aggressive biofuel targets yet as President-elect Donald Trump takes over. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, signed into law by President George W. Bush, is one of the countrys most controversial energy policies. It requires energy firms to blend ethanol and biodiesel into gasoline and diesel.      The policy was designed to cut greenhouse gas emissions, reduce U.S. reliance on oil imports and boost rural economies that provide the crops for biofuels. It has pitted two of Trumps support bases against each other: Big Oil and Big Corn. The farming sector has lobbied hard for the maximum biofuel volumes laid out in the law to be blended into gasoline motor fuels, while the oil industry argues that the program creates additional costs. Balancing oil and farm interests is likely to prove a challenge for Trump, who has promised to curtail regulations on the oil industry but is already being reminded by biofuels advocates of the importance of the program to the American Midwest, where he received strong support from voters on Nov. 8.     Oil groups are renewing their calls to change or repeal the program following Wednesdays announcement, when the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set record mandates for renewable fuels - for the first time hitting levels targeted by Congress nearly a decade ago.. The EPA plan is completely detached from market realities and confirms once again that Congress must take immediate action to remedy this broken program, said Chet Thompson, President of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, in a statement. It is unclear what Trumps plans for the program will be and his transition team did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Both camps are expecting an administration receptive to their demands, though both have expressed concern and uncertainty over Trumps plans for the program, according to experts, industry and political sources.   The installation of climate change skeptic Myron Ebell as head of the transition at the EPA bolstered oil industry confidence Trump will swing their way. In September, Trump appeared to briefly echo the views of his supporter, billionaire Carl Icahn, who expressed concern about the program. Icahn, who owns a stake in an oil refiner, renewed those criticisms last week, saying the ethanol credit market generated by the program is susceptible to manipulation and harming independent refiners. PRO-ETHANOL CAMPAIGNING The president-elect campaigned on a pro-ethanol platform when he visited Americas farm states and biofuels advocates expect he will keep the RFS strong, maintaining annual targets at the minimum set forth by Congress. Mr. Trump will not turn his back on the American heartland, we believe in him, said Annette Sweeney, a former state representative from Iowa who was a member of the Trumps agricultural advisory committee during his candidacy. To a certain extent, we are on higher ground. You always want to be on higher ground, said Bob Dinneen, head of the Renewable Fuels Association, referring to the increase. Well be able to demonstrate the marketplace can absorb 15 billion gallons of ethanol. We can put this all behind us. As we look to 2018... theres no reason to go back, he said. The renewables industries have already started to emphasize their place among American-made fuels, something experts expect will appeal to Trump. There are a lot of good things to be said about second-generation fuels, even from the new administrations perspective, said Harvard University professor and former Obama administration advisor James Stock. All the new administration needs to do is embrace the original ... vision of the RFS, he said. ",1.0

Kanye West appears to dump Trump with disappearing tweets,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kanye West, one of Donald Trumps biggest celebrity supporters, appeared to have deleted his tweets about his meeting last year with the then U.S. president-elect in which the two discussed multicultural issues. The influential rappers handful of Twitter entries from their Dec. 13 meeting at Trump Tower in New York, where West said he had wanted to discuss bullying, supporting teachers, modernizing curriculums and violence in Chicago, were missing from his account on Monday. After the meeting, West had also tweeted that he felt it  important to have a direct line of communication with our future president if we truly want change. West, 39, emerged as one of Trumps most high-profile supporters during the 2016 election campaign. He made headlines in November when he was booed at a concert for declaring his support for Trump, although he said he had not voted in the presidential election. It was not clear why the Trump tweets had been deleted but the Jesus Walks singer has been the target of outrage and sarcasm from fans on social media following the December meeting. Wests representatives did not return requests for comment. Celebrity website TMZ, quoting an unidentified source, said West had deleted the tweets because he was unhappy about Trumps actions since taking office. These include a ban on travelers to the United States from seven predominantly Muslim nations and Trump saying he will send in the Feds to fix the horrible carnage going on in Chicago due to high crime rates. West was raised in Chicago. ",1.0

Russia sanctions bill remains stalled in U.S. Congress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers said on Monday they did not know when legislation to impose new sanctions on Russia might come up for a vote in the House of Representatives, and the White House said it had concerns about the measure. The legislation passed the Senate by a nearly unanimous margin two weeks ago, looking like it might complicate President Donald Trumps desire for warmer relations with Moscow, where officials have denounced new sanctions. A White House official said the Trump administration felt some provisions in the bill would interfere with its ability to use sanctions to try to influence Russia. There are some provisions in the Senate bill that would unprecedentedly impair Treasurys ability to wield its sanctions tools, risk endangering the transatlantic sanctions coalition, and weaken the State Departments ability to credibly signal that we would calibrate our sanctions in response to Russian behavior, the official said in an emailed statement, requesting anonymity. Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a co-author of the legislation, said he hoped for progress within the next day or two on a procedural issue that has kept the House from taking up the Countering Irans Destabilizing Activities Act, which also includes the new sanctions against Russia. The measure must pass the House, where Trumps fellow Republicans control a larger majority than in the Senate, before it can be sent for Trump to sign into law or veto. House Republican leaders said last week that the Senate bill violated a constitutional requirement that any bill affecting government revenues must originate in the House, something known as a blue slip violation. House aides also said leadership had not yet decided whether to vote on the Senate bill once the blue slip issue was resolved, or first refer it to House committees, which could further delay or change it. Democrats said they were skeptical about the blue slip explanation, noting that the issue had resolved very quickly in recent years for other bills. Corker said Senate Republicans remained solidly behind the legislation. Ive heard no one here have second thoughts, by the way he told Reuters. If you find one, please tell me. White House spokesman Sean Spicer declined comment during a news briefing on Monday on whether the administration would support the sanctions bill. ",1.0
Scottish government recommends rejection of EU withdrawal bill,"EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Scotland s devolved government has recommended that its parliament at Holyrood withhold consent for legislation to withdraw Britain from the European Union, on the grounds that it could water down their powers, a document filed by the Scottish government said on Tuesday. The approval of the devolved parliaments in Scotland and Wales does not represent a veto to the Brexit process, although it would stretch Britain s constitutional tensions yet further by forcing the UK government of Prime Minister Theresa May to ignore the expressed wish of the devolved bodies. Scotland would work with the Welsh government to propose amendments to the bill which, if agreement were reached, would allow it to recommend its passage in the devolved assemblies, the document said. The bill will end the supremacy of EU law in the UK and convert all existing EU laws into domestic ones.  Along with the Welsh government, the Scottish government cannot recommend to the parliament that it gives consent to the bill as currently drafted,  the document filed with the Scottish parliament said.  The Scottish government is also clear that the result of withdrawal from the EU should not be centralization of power in Whitehall and Westminster. However, that is what the bill proposes.   Scotland s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been arguing that Brexit as proposed flies in the face of the devolution agreement, which up to now has allowed assemblies in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast to legislate on their own domestic policies such as health and education. Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to keep EU membership in a June 2016 referendum while England and Wales voted to leave.  It remains a matter of regret to the Scottish government that the UK plans to withdraw from the EU. The government nevertheless accepts that preparations should be made for withdrawal from the EU, including preserving a functioning legal system,  the document said.  The Scottish government s key objections to the bill as introduced relate to the provisions on the competence of the Scottish parliament and government (...) and those on powers for UK and Scottish ministers to alter domestic law,  it said. The Scottish and Welsh governments argue that returning powers now exercised by the EU to the UK government will imply restrictions on the power of Scottish and Welsh chambers. But Britain s Scotland minister, David Mundell, has said that the repeal will ultimately result in a boost in devolved parliamentary power.     ",1.0
Brexit tycoon Banks says Russia did not fund campaign to leave the EU,"LONDON (Reuters) - Arron Banks, a tycoon who backed leaving the European Union, on Wednesday dismissed allegations that Russia had funded Brexit. Britain s electoral commission earlier said it had opened an investigation into whether Banks breached campaign finance rules in the 2016 Brexit referendum.  Allegations of Brexit being funded by the Russians... are complete bollocks (rubbish) from beginning to end,  Banks said in an emailed statement. Commenting on the electoral commission investigation, Banks said:  This is the Remain establishment once again trying to discredit the result and it s all starting to get rather boring!  Banks ended the statement with the word  Nostrovia , a mispronunciation of the Russian phrase  na zdorovie  which is sometimes used as a toast to good health when drinking. ",1.0

Zimbabwe's Mugabe sacks VP seen as top succession candidate,"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s President Robert Mugabe fired Emmerson Mnangagwa as vice president on Monday for showing  traits of disloyalty , his information minister said, abruptly removing a favorite to succeed the 93-year-old leader. Mnangagwa s removal provides a boost for Mugabe s wife, Grace, who has been a vocal critic of the vice president and is also seen as a potential successor to her husband.  The vice president has consistently and persistently exhibited traits of disloyalty, disrespect, deceitfulness and unreliability,  Information Minister Simon Khaya Moyo told reporters.  It had become evident that his conduct in his discharge of his duties had become inconsistent with his official responsibilities.  Mnangagwa s top aide Christopher Gwatidzo said he had not seen the statement by Khaya Moyo and declined to say whether the vice president had been at his office on Monday.  Grace, 52, nicknamed  Gucci Grace  for her love of shopping, called Mnangagwa a  coup plotter  and a  coward  on Sunday in a speech that inflamed an already bad-tempered rift in the ruling Zanu-PF party. It followed a speech by Mugabe at a rally on Saturday where he publicly rebuked his deputy for the first time. The reaction of the military could be key. Some army generals backed Mnangagwa to succeed Mugabe and have publicly said they will not allow someone who did not fight in the 1970s independence war to rule. Grace did not fight in that war. Grace made international headlines in August when a South African model said the Zimbabwean first lady had whipped her with an electric cable in a Johannesburg hotel suite. Grace denied the allegations. The fight over the future control of ZANU-PF has overshadowed an economic crisis marked by chronic shortages of cash and spiraling prices of goods that has raised fears of a return to hyperinflation. Mnangagwa was Mugabe s protege and had been at his side through five decades of prison, guerrilla war and then post-liberation government, and questions are being raised about what caused the fallout between the two men. By firing Mnangagwa, Mugabe has removed one of his last remaining liberation war comrades who have stood by him since independence from Britain in 1980. However, Grace said on Sunday Mnangagwa had always been plotting against her husband, even months after independence. Mnangagwa s biggest undoing may well have been his vocal supporters, who kept prodding Mugabe to step down. Mugabe has a history of punishing ambition in ZANU-PF. Relations also cooled between the two men in August after suggestions by Mnangagwa s allies that he had been poisoned by ice cream from a dairy owned by the Mugabes. That Mnangagwa s expulsion was announced by a government minister and not the chief secretary to the president and cabinet also spoke to the deterioration in the relationship. Mugabe plans to contest elections due next year and will likely face a weakened and fractured opposition. His main rival Morgan Tsvangirai has been in and out of a South African hospital after announcing he had colon cancer in 2016. ",1.0
INSTANT VIEW: Reactions to grand jury subpoenas regarding Donald Trump Jr.,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Grand jury subpoenas have been issued in connection with a June 2016 meeting that included President Donald Trumps son, his son-in-law and a Russian lawyer, two sources told Reuters on Thursday, in a sign that special counsel Robert Muellers investigation is gathering pace. The sources added that Mueller had convened a grand jury in Washington to help investigate allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Bonds view this as a flight to quality while stocks had a minor hiccup. The Euro is near the highs of the day. This makes the placement of Treasuries going into tomorrows employment number at the recent highs, not a good risk reward. JIM PAULSEN, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, THE LEUTHOLD GROUP, MINNEAPOLIS: Were going to get a fair number of these headlines. Its going to take a while, whatever happens. Anything that represents volatility is an automatic sell (for stocks).  Im not even sure if beyond the volatility theres much of Wall Street that would get terribly upset if (Trump) got impeached. That would give them (current Vice President Mike) Pence, and likely full power for Republicans and maybe some policies being enacted including health care, tax reform and a fiscal spending program. Even reinforce less regulations. From a Wall Street standpoint I cant say over the long term that (a Trump impeachment) would be a bad result for stocks. The uncertainty of going through it all would be a negative, but Im not sure the market would remain lower for long, assuming all else is equal.  AXEL MERK, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF MERK INVESTMENTS IN PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA: Given that Trumps approval rating is very low, and given that it might be all but impossible to find a jury that hasnt heard of the allegations, odds are this jury might be leaning against Trump. This is yet a negative for the administration, and with that, if recent months are any guide, it is a negative for the dollar. And so yes, sure enough, the euro rallied on this. This is good news for the euro, this should be good news for goldand it is ultimately a negative also for risk assets only for the reason that the Trump agenda has ever more difficulty of being realized because it does weaken the presidency. The hopes for real growth picking up are just diminishing the more headwinds the administration is getting. CHRIS ZACCARELLI, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CORNERSTONE FINANCIAL PARTNERS, HUNTERSVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA:  To the extent that people are afraid something will happen to the presidency of the United States, whether that brings us closer to impeachment or serves as a further distraction for the administration, neither of those are good for the markets or a risk-on position. Its more distraction for the White House and less stability  It definitely was market moving. The timing lines up perfectly. The immediate drop was probably computer driven but people arent taking advantage of the dip. JUAN PEREZ, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, TEMPUS INC, WASHINGTON DC:  The world is paying attention and ultimately currencies are weighed to measure the stability of a country, whether you can have faith in whats going on or not  I think with this investigation and the constant bombardment of news out of the White House the rest of the world is starting to see this image of somewhat of an unstable U.S., which is somewhat unprecedented. And now politics, even more than economic data, is really a driver of dollar weakness. Whats really going to weigh heavily on the dollar for the remainder of the year is that as long as this investigation continues and there is a probe and the White House continues to work on everything except the economic agenda its going to weigh heavily on the dollar. The reaction was certainly immediate (to the news). Looking at it long-term, is this going to affect the dollar in a negative way? Absolutely it is. STOCKS: U.S. stocks extended losses, with the S&P falling around 0.2 percent after the news, then tracking back slightly.  BONDS:  U.S. bond yields fell to session lows.

Democrats Caught in Major Lie About DREAMERS [Video],"Democrats have been spouting the narrative that DACA recipients are overwhelmingly serving in the military. That s a lie! Fewer than 900 DACA recipients out of 800,000 are serving in the armed forces. The Democrats have been lying about who makes up DACA but this is a HUGE glaring lie.Breitbart News reports that fraud is rampant for DACA:Fraud is rampant and  huge  for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, a former official with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) agency alleges. Under DACA, nearly 800,000 illegal aliens were given temporary protected status and work permits to remain in the United States. Experts have told Breitbart Texas that during the Obama Administration, background screening was lax.In an interview with LifeZette, former USCIS manager of the agency s investigative unit, Matt O Brien, alleged that the fraud rate for DACA is roughly  40 to 50 percent  and potentially even  higher : Based on what I had seen and what I discussed with my colleagues, the fraud rate is 40 to 50 percent. It s possible that it was higher,  he told LifeZette this week.IN CASE YOU WANT MORE INFO ON DACA: WATCH AG Jeff Sessions Explain Why Obama s Unconstitutional Act Has Harmed Americans US Attorney General Jeff Sessions brilliantly lays out the case for America and against those who believe it s okay to break our laws, as long as you have lawmakers who are willing to look the other way The Department of Homeland Security will stop processing any new applications for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program. I am here today to announce that the program known as DACA that was effectuated under the Obama administration is being rescinded,  Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Tuesday at a Justice Department news conference.Sessions was critical of the Obama program implemented through executive order in 2012 to give work authorization and government benefits, like Social Security to nearly a million illegal aliens.  MRCTV Watch: The brilliant Jessica Vaughan, from the Center for Immigration Studies, shared these important facts about DACA recipients in America, compiled by Harvard University researcher Roberto G. Gonzales, called the National UnDACAmented Research Project. There are important (self-acknowledged) caveats to the findings: The research is based on an online survey of just over 2,000 self-described DACA-eligible respondents and about 200 follow-up interviews. Gonzales believes that for a variety of reasons, the respondents are more educated and well-off than the DACA population as a whole.Nevertheless, the findings are interesting. Here is a sample:73 percent of DACA recipients he surveyed live in a low-income household (defined as qualifying for free lunch in high school); 22 percent have earned a degree from a four-year college or university; 21 percent have dropped out of high school; 20 percent have no education beyond high school and no plans to attend college; 59 percent obtained a new job with a DACA work permit, but only 45 percent increased their overall earnings; 36 percent have a parent who holds a bachelor s degree; and 51 percent were already employed before DACA. None of this is to suggest that these individuals should not be considered for an amnesty or legalization program, but to suggest that the arguments in favor of such a program are largely political rather than economic. Immigrants who are not highly educated and who are working in low-paying jobs are more likely to access welfare and other public assistance programs over the course of their lives. ",0.0
"BREAKING BOMBSHELL: Blonde Clinton Neighbor, Dubbed The Energizer Gets $2 MILLION From Clinton Charity","Here s how Donald Trump reacted Donald Trump reacted Friday to a report that the Clinton Global Foundation provided millions to a power company partly owned by a rich, blond divorcee by saying that people have been whispering about her possible romantic ties to Bill Clinton for a long time.The  commitment  to Julie Tauber McMahon s firm from the Clinton Global Initiative was placed on its 2010 conference agenda at Clinton s urging, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.The initiative  commits $2 million to support the work of Energy Pioneer Solutions, a company founded to deliver energy savings to communities in rural America,  said a 2010 statement from the charity. People have been talking about this for years. I have no idea what went on. I certainly don t,  the presumptive GOP presidential nominee said on  Fox & Friends. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the Clinton Global Initiative doled out $2 million to Energy Pioneer Solutions, which is partly owned by Julie Tauber McMahon.The fit, blond mother of three, who lives just minutes from Bill and Hillary Clinton s home in Chappaqua, West chester, is the daughter of Joel Tauber, a millionaire donor to the Democratic Party.McMahon, 54, is rumored to be the woman dubbed  Energizer  by the Secret Service at the Clinton home because of her frequent visits, according to RadarOnline.Secret Service agents were even given special instructions to abandon usual protocol when the woman came by, according to journalist Ronald Kessler s tell-all book,  The First Family Detail. You don t stop her, you don t approach her, you just let her go in,  says the book, based on agents  accounts. Energizer  is described in the book as a charming visitor who sometimes brought cookies to the agents.The book describes one sun-drenched afternoon when agents took notice of the woman s revealing attire. It was a warm day, and she was wearing a low-cut tank top, and as she leaned over, her breasts were very exposed,  an agent is quoted in the book as saying. Energizer  reportedly timed her arrivals and departures around Hillary Clinton s schedule.When asked about whether there should be a probe into money directed from the foundation   a charity   to the company, Trump said:  Well, I assume you put the word  charity  in quotes. The interviewer, who cited the New York Post s cover story, told Trump that Clinton helped steer an $812,000 federal grant to the company through then-Energy Secretary Steven Chu.The interviewer also pointed out that  nonprofits are not supposed to act in anyone s private interests.

Factbox: How proposed new U.S. sanctions would affect Russia,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to impose new sanctions on Moscow, triggering an angry reaction from Russian officials, but analysts are playing down the impact. The sanctions, which have yet to be approved by the U.S. Senate and President Donald Trump, expand and tweak a list of existing sanctions, but cannot be viewed as a game changer, analysts said. Russian President Vladimir Putin will decide if and how Moscow will retaliate once the fresh sanctions become law. Below are highlights from the bill and analysts reactions:   The United States should continue to uphold and seek unity with European and other key partners on sanctions implemented against the Russian Federation, which have been effective and instrumental in countering Russian aggression in Ukraine. The Secretary of the Treasury shall submit ... a report describing in detail the potential effects of expanding sanctions ... to include sovereign debt and the full range of derivative products. The Secretary of the Treasury shall review sanctions from 2014 to ensure that the directive prohibits the conduct by United States persons or persons within the United States of all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of longer than 14 days maturity or new equity of persons determined to be subject to the directive, their property, or their interests in property. The Secretary of the Treasury may determine that a person meets one or more of the criteria ... if that person is a state-owned entity operating in the railway, or metals and mining sector of the economy of the Russian Federation. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence and the Secretary of State, shall submit a detailed report on Russias senior foreign political figures and oligarchs. The bill is designed to continue to oppose the NordStream 2 pipeline given its detrimental impacts on the European Unions energy security, gas market development in Central and Eastern Europe, and energy reforms in Ukraine. Trump, in coordination with allies of the United States, may impose sanctions on an entity that makes an investment described in the Act or sells, leases, or provides to the Russian Federation, for the construction of Russian energy export pipelines, goods, services, technology, information, or support ... any of which has a fair market value of $1,000,000 or more; or that, during a 12-month period, have an aggregate fair market value of $5,000,000 or more. With the Senate voting 92-2 and the House 419-3, it is highly unlikely that President Trump would veto the bill, said Charles Robertson, Global Chief Economist at Renaissance Capital in London. Long term this is really bad news. We know from Jackson-Vaneck that these kind of sanctions are hard to remove once in place. This will further stall foreign investment into Russia, negatively impacting growth and development, furthering long-term capital flight and brain drain. It will further the isolation from the West, and stagnation of the Russian economy, said Tim Ash, a Senior Strategist at BlueBay Asset Management in London. Most importantly for Russia, the original Senate bill with regard to Nord Stream 2 was watered down as it now requires coordination with allies when imposing such sanctions. Moreover, the bill only gives the option for the president to introduce such sanctions, but does not require that he does so. So, overall, I expect marginal negative effect, Ivan Tchakarov, senior economist at Citi in Moscow. In general we think that the impact on the Russian economy should be relatively limited. Compared to 2014 when the first set of sanctions was introduced the Russian economy is in much better state to weather the measures, said Liza Ermolenko, emerging European economist at Barclays in London. In the U.S. sanctions bill we have not seen any direct negative implications for the rouble so far. Some tightening of the trade financing terms would not have a material negative impact on the rouble, although it may lead to a shortage of the dollar liquidity in the market and its not clear how well companies and banks were prepared to this, said Alexey Pogorelov, chief economist at Credit Suisse in London.

Trump hostility set to deepen Iran power struggles,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Iranians quickly closed ranks against a hawkish new U.S. approach to Tehran, but Iran s powerful hardliners are set to exploit the latest dispute with Washington to weaken domestic rivals who are open to the West, analysts and insiders say. President Donald Trump s warning on Friday that he might ultimately terminate a landmark 2015 nuclear deal sets the stage for an eventual resurgence of political infighting within Iran s complex power structures, officials said. If the accord signed by Iran and six major powers does start to fall apart, anyone who strongly promoted it, such as pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani, could face a career-damaging backlash.  That could leave Iran s security hardliners unchallenged at home, enabling greater Iranian assertiveness abroad that could worsen tensions in the Middle East, analysts say. For the moment, solidarity within the Islamic Republic s faction-ridden political elite is the priority.  What matters now is unity against the foreign enemy,  a senior official told Reuters on condition of anonymity, like other figures contacted within Iran because of the sensitivity of the matter.  Our national interest is a priority for all Iranian officials.  But Rouhani and pragmatists and reformist allies who promoted the deal, which lifted sanctions in return for Tehran rolling back technologies with nuclear bomb-making potential, may become increasingly politically vulnerable at home.  GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY  FOR ROUHANI S CRITICS Trump on Friday defied both U.S. allies and adversaries by refusing to formally certify that Tehran is complying with the accord even though international inspectors say it is.  The growing tension with America is a golden opportunity for hardliners to clip Rouhani s wings,  said a Rouhani ally, who was involved in the 18-month nuclear talks.  Iran s top authority, hardline Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, guardedly backed Rouhani when he opened the door to nuclear diplomacy with world powers, but has repeatedly expressed pessimism about Washington remaining committed to it. For Rouhani the stakes are high: His rapprochement with the world won him enhanced popularity at home and prestige abroad, dealing a setback to Khamenei s hardline allies, who oppose both detente with the West and domestic liberalization. Now the tables may be turning.   Hardliners will use Trump s threat as a Sword of Damocles over Rouhani s head ... While enjoying the economic benefits of the deal,  said Tehran-based political analyst Saeed Leylaz, referring to the lifting of tough oil and banking sanctions.   Rouhani and his detente policy with the world will be weakened if the deal does not survive,  another senior Iranian official said.   And of course an aggressive regional policy is inevitable.  Under Iran s unique dual system of clerical and republican rule, the elected president is subordinate to the unelected Khamenei, who has in the past reasserted control when infighting threatened the existence of the Islamic Republic. Trump s policy will play into the hands of hardliners eventually, said an ally of Khamenei.  What matters is the Islamic Republic and its interests.  TIT-FOR-TAT STEPS In reaction to Trump, Rouhani signaled Iran would withdraw from the agreement if it failed to preserve Tehran s interests. The survival of the deal now is up to the U.S. Congress, which might try to modify it or reimpose U.S. sanctions on Iran.  But even if the Congress refuses to consider sanctions, the deal could still be in jeopardy if Washington and Tehran resort to tit-for-tat retaliatory steps.   As long as both sides only exchange words, business will continue as usual,  said Leylaz.  Since the lifting of sanctions, Rouhani has started to repair an economy ravaged by a decade of restrictions on its vital oil industry and issued warm welcomes to global investors. But major European investors could think twice about involvement in Iran if tension mounts with the United States and uncertainty grows over survival of the accord.  If European companies don t have the comfort of a political agreement endorsed by the Americans they will say stop,  said a senior French diplomat. Among European firms that have announced big deals in Iran since the deal took effect are planemaker Airbus AIR.PA, French energy group Total TOTF.PA and Germany s Siemens SIEGn.DE.  Trump enraged Tehran by saying that the Revolutionary Guards, which have fought Iran s regional proxy wars for decades, was Khamenei s  corrupt personal terror force and militia . Rouhani said Iranians would always stand by the Guards.  Several officials agreed that Trump s hostility would not change Iran s regional behavior, determined by Khamenei. But if Trump somehow made good on his threats,  then Iran will adopt a harsher and aggressive regional policy,  said one of the officials familiar with Iran s decision-making policy. Iran and its rival Saudi Arabia accuse each other of fuelling regional tensions. The Sunni Muslim kingdom is at odds with Tehran s revolutionary Shi ite leaders in struggles across the Arab world, including Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Bahrain and Lebanon.  On social policy, Rouhani s scope to loosen restrictions on individual freedoms and rights would be crushed by hardliners if  he loses political prestige. Hardliners control the judiciary, security forces and state media.  Whenever pressured abroad, the regime increases pressure at home to silence any opposition,  said a former moderate official. ",1.0
 NY Lawmakers Compare MMA Fighting To Gay P*rn And Police Abuse,"On Tuesday, the New York State Assembly passed a bill that legalized mixed martial arts (MMA), but it was the debate leading up to the passage of the bill that got the most attention. State lawmakers compared the sport to slavery and gay porn, the claims were so outrageous that former UFC middleweight champion Chris Weidman said he was  embarrassed for them. New York is currently the only state that bans the popular MMA sport and this was the first time the State Assembly has ever brought it to a vote, despite the fact that the Senate has passed it seven years in a row. So when lawmakers finally passed the bill, it was a big deal, unfortunately, it was overshadowed by a whole lot of stupidity during the debate.Sadly one of the most mindblowing comments came from a Democrat: I thought I should learn a little bit about (MMA),  said Assemblyman Daniel O Donnell (D-Manhattan), who is gay.  Well, I should really like it. You have two nearly naked, hot men trying to dominate each other. That s gay porn with a different ending. I m going to assume that O Donnell, the brother of actress/comedian Rosie O Donnell, was trying to channel his sister and be funny with his dissenting opinion, but he failed miserably. He wasn t the only lawmaker to make a crazy comparison, Assemblyman Charles Barron said it was like slavery and police violence: You know how we feel about the chokehold in New York City. You can put him in a chokehold and the ref has to be determining whether he got choked enough or she got choked enough. This (sport) is not something we should legalize or regulate. That s taking it a little far. MMA fighters know exactly what their sport is about;  Eric Garner, however, did not expect the NYPD to choke him to death when he sold loose cigarettes. Comparing a sport to systematic police abuse is outrageous and offensive.When asked about the lawmakers  comparisons, Chris Weidman said: Some of the things they were saying were so ridiculous that I was actually happy and embarrassed for them for even bringing it up. It s things I ve heard people behind closed doors might be saying, but to hear them say it live and to the public, I actually thought it was pretty interesting   and probably good for us. I just thought it was embarrassing on their part. I have to agree with him, the lawmakers sounded ridiculous. We expect Republicans to make outlandish claims when they are arguing against something, but when Democrats do it, it s even more embarrassing. We are smarter than that and frankly, they should both apologize for their crass remarks.Featured image via Steve Marcus/Getty Images",0.0

U.S. court puts Obamacare case on hold until Trump takes office,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Monday brought to an end President Barack Obamas bid to overturn a ruling that threatens to gut his signature healthcare law by putting the case on hold until after President-elect Donald Trump, who aims to repeal Obamacare, takes office. The Obama administration had appealed a judges May ruling favoring the challenge filed by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives against a key part of the 2010 law. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed to a request by the Republicans to delay its consideration of the governments appeal until after Trump takes office on Jan. 20. The Obama administration opposed the move. If the law is repealed by Congress, the case would be moot. The courts decision to put the case on hold will not have an immediate effect on the law, as the lower court ruling was put on hold pending the appeal. The court said both sides should provide an update on the status of the case by Feb. 21. The challenge targeted government reimbursements to insurance companies to compensate them for reductions that the law required them to make to customers out-of-pocket medical payments. Trump has said he favors repealing and replacing Obamacare but would consider retaining certain elements.  The law has enabled millions of previously uninsured Americans to obtain health insurance, but Republicans condemn Obamacare as a government overreach and have mounted a series of legal challenges. The Obama administration appealed U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyers ruling that the government cannot spend billions of dollars in federal funds without congressional approval to provide subsidies under the healthcare law to private insurers to help people afford medical coverage. The House Republicans argued that the administration violated the U.S. Constitution because it is the legislative branch, not the executive branch, that authorizes government spending. The Obama administration has interpreted the provision as a type of federal spending that does not need to be explicitly authorized by Congress. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2012 and 2015 issued major rulings authored by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts that preserved Obamacare and rejected conservative challenges. ",1.0
 The World Speaks Out On Trump  Top Foreign Diplomats Unite Against Him,"Here s the thing about being the leader of the free world, you need to be able to get along with other nations and be able to work with them hand in glove. However, the world seems to be united against he possibility of Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump. Several foreign diplomats have issued statements declaring their concern.According to Reuters: Officials from Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and Asia have complained in recent private conversations, mostly about the xenophobic nature of Trump s statements, said three U.S. officials, who all declined to be identified. With one of the officials stating: As the [Trump] rhetoric has continued, and in some cases amped up, so, too, have concerns by certain leaders around the world. Reuters explains: U.S. officials said it was highly unusual for foreign diplomats to express concern, even privately, about candidates in the midst of a presidential campaign. U.S. allies in particular usually don t want to be seen as meddling in domestic politics, mindful that they will have to work with whoever wins.Senior leaders in several countries   including Britain, Mexico, France, and Canada   have already made public comments criticizing Trump s positions. German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel branded him a threat to peace and prosperity in an interview published on Sunday. With Trump s consistent racist and xenophobic talk and tactics that are borderline fascist and totalitarian, it is easy to see why so many worldwide are deeply concerned. One senior NATO official said: European diplomats are constantly asking about Trump s rise with disbelief and, now, growing panic. With the EU facing an existential crisis, there s more than the usual anxiety about the U.S. turning inward when Europe needs U.S. support more than ever. Just last week,  more than 90 Republican foreign policy veterans have pledged to oppose Donald Trump, saying his proposals would undermine U.S. security, in the latest sign of fissures between the Republican presidential front-runner and the party establishment. It has been clear that not only Democrats don t want Trump, but also Republicans and pretty much the entire world. We, as voters, need to make sure that Trump gets nowhere near the Oval Office, not even on a White House tour. He s dangerous and would not only tarnish the image of the United States at home and abroad, but may cause irreversible harm to diplomatic relations worldwide.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)",0.0
15 SURPRISING FACTS About The White House Easter Egg Roll,"The big question this year for the White House Easter Egg roll is whether White House Press Scretary will show up as the Easter Bunny. A little known fact and tradition has been that Spicer is the Easter Bunny! What a guy! Who knew that the guy who dressed in the bunny costume would one day be the 45th President s Press Secretary 15 SURPRISING FACTS ABOUT THE WHITE HOUSE EASTER EGG ROLL:While the long-established custom of rolling eggs on the historic grounds has practically become a rite of passage for those who observe Easter, this time-honored tradition has come a long way since it was officially established by President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1878. In fact, the fun in Washington on Capitol Hill almost didn t become the grandstanding institution as we now know it today.Here, we look back at the White House Easter Egg Roll s 138-year history to highlight 15 of the most surprising and memorable moments associated with the most sought-after ticket in D.C.1. According to the White House Historical Association, some historians note that it was first lady Dolley Madison who originally proposed the idea of a public egg roll around 1810. Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson s young children held their own informal egg roll for their own amusement in the 1860s.2. Taking advantage of a day off from school, more than 10,000 children were said to have gathered near the cast-iron dome of the U.S. capitol in 1876. Baskets in tow, filled with dyed Easter eggs, they set about to carry on the holiday tradition of rolling eggs down the hills to see how far they d go without breaking.3. Uh oh, here comes the fun police. The unusual sport of rolling and racing after hard-cooked eggs apparently did a lot of damage to the grounds of the Capitol. So in 1876, members of Congress approved the Turf Protection Act, signed by President Ulysses S. Grant, which prevented the Capitol s grounds from being used  as a playground.  The law was supposed to take effect in 1877, but inclement weather prevented any Easter activities from occurring that year anyway. However, the egg rollers who showed up in 1878 were turned away and forced to play elsewhere.4. President Hayes and his wife, Lucy, brought the holiday tradition back later in 1878 for the first official White House Easter Egg Roll. Every year thereafter, with a few notable exceptions, presidents have hosted the celebration on the South Lawn.5. By the late 1800s, games such as egg picking, egg ball, toss and catch, and egg croquet were added to the Easter festivities.6. The treasured tradition was cancelled due to World War I and suspended during the Second World War in 1942. When the White House underwent renovations in that same year, it was hosted by Congress and held at other locations.7. After a 12-year hiatus, President Dwight D. Eisenhower brought the egg-stravaganza back in 1953.8. In 1969, the White House Easter Bunny went hoppin  down the government trail for the first time. The bunny was actually a staffer for first lady Pat Nixon. While we know that the Easter bunny is always part of the current administration s staff, the rules forbid the bunny from revealing his or her identity, until now that is.9. Ursula Meese, wife of President Reagan s Attorney General Edwin Meese III, was quite the Peter Rabbit of her time, as she performed as the White House Bunny for six seasons. It earned her the nickname  The Meester Bunny.  And thanks to this unofficial  Twitter account, we know just who was under the fleece costume during the George W. Bush Administration as well. Today, he s traded in the long bunny ears for a suit and a podium, but there s no word yet if current Press Secretary Sean Spicer will be making a furry-tailed appearance again for this year s celebration.10. Enter the sacred spoon in 1974. Organizers were tasked with finding silverware for the first egg-rolling races, where children used spoons to push their eggs through the grass, down marked-off lanes.11. Step right up: The circus came to town in 1977. President Jimmy Carter introduced a three-ring circus and menagerie, including a 1,200-pound steer named  Big Red. 12. President Ronald Reagan, a superstar in his own right, brought a little Hollywood to the White House event in 1981. Not only did he and wife, Nancy, present Broadway show performances and the  Egg Hunt Pits,  but they also had balloons from the Macy s Thanksgiving Day Parade floating in mid-air.13. The Reagans were also the first to use wooden eggs at the Easter egg hunt, which were signed by Hollywood s elite, widely-recognized athletes, and notable politicians. Ever since, wooden eggs imprinted with the president and first lady s signatures are handed out as a small memento to children under 13 years old.14. By 2009, the Easter Egg Roll had become the hottest ticket in D.C. So much so, an online lottery for tickets was established to give children from all around the country the opportunity to attend. The lottery is held in March each year for three days only.15. Sean Spicer is the Easter Bunny!WHAT A GUY!Via: Southern Living",0.0
Senate Budget Committee approves Mulvaney as budget director,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Budget Committee on Thursday voted to confirm Republican Congressman Mick Mulvaney as White House budget director under President Donald Trump. Senators narrowly approved Trumps nominee along party lines in a 12-11 vote. Democrats criticized him for hard line fiscal positions on popular social programs and for failing to pay more than $15,000 in taxes in relation to a household employee until after he was nominated. His nomination will now move to the Senate floor for a full confirmation vote.  Mulvaney, a South Carolina Republican and a leading member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, favors raising the Social Security retirement age to 70 and means-testing beneficiaries of the Medicare healthcare program. Budget committee Chairman Mike Enzi, a Wyoming Republican, told the panel Mulvaney is uniquely qualified to be budget director: He is a proven budget hawk thats been vocal about our need to rein in government spending and debt.      But the nominee came under fire from Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination last year.  The Vermont lawmaker warned that Mulvaneys positions on Social Security and Medicare contradict Trumps campaign statements to leave the programs untouched. Sanders also said his failure to pay taxes for a nanny he employed from 2000 to 2004 should disqualify him as a nominee.   Sanders and fellow independent Angus King of Maine voted with the committees nine Democrats to oppose Mulvaney. ",1.0

Ethics lawyers to sue Trump over foreign payments,"(Reuters) - A group including former White House ethics attorneys will file a lawsuit on Monday accusing President Donald Trump of allowing his businesses to accept payments from foreign governments, in violation of the U.S. Constitution. The lawsuit, brought by the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, will allege that the Constitutions emoluments clause forbids payments to Trumps businesses. It will seek a court order forbidding Trump from accepting such payments, said Deepak Gupta, one of the lawyers working on the case. Trump does business with countries like China, India, Indonesia and the Philippines, the group noted in a statement. When Trump the president sits down to negotiate trade deals with these countries, the American people will have no way of knowing whether he will also be thinking about the profits of Trump the businessman, it said. Trump told reporters on Monday the lawsuit was without merit, when asked about the case after signing some executive orders in the Oval Office.  The White House referred questions to a law firm representing the president on ethics matters.  We do not comment on our clients or the work we do for them, said the representative of the firm, Morgan Lewis & Bockius. The case is part of a wave of litigation expected to be filed against Trump by liberal advocacy groups. It will be filed in federal court in Manhattan, Gupta said, and attorneys for the plaintiffs will include Richard Painter, a former ethics lawyer in Republican President George W. Bushs White House. The impending lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times.  Eric Trump, one of Trumps sons and an executive vice president of the Trump Organization, told the Times on Sunday that the company had taken more steps than required by law to avoid any possible legal exposure, such as agreeing to donate any profits collected at Trump-owned hotels that come from foreign government guests to the U.S. Treasury. This is purely harassment for political gain, Trump told the newspaper. The Constitutions emoluments clause states: No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.

India probes if shortage of oxygen supplies killed 30 infants,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian police are investigating whether 30 infants died for lack of oxygen in a northern state-run hospital, the second case within a month in which medical supply shortages have been blamed for the deaths of dozens of children. An underfunded, poorly managed public health system is in the spotlight after more than 60 children died in August in a public hospital in northern Uttar Pradesh, amid accusations that oxygen supplies ran out because of unpaid bills. Police launched an investigation on Sunday in the latest case after a government report blamed the chief medical officer and doctors at another institution in the northern state, Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, for the deaths of 30 children.   The infants died of  perinatal asphyxia  at the newborn care unit of the hospital in the state s Farrukhabad district between July 21 and Aug. 20, police said.  The probe officer was told by mothers that the hospital did not insert oxygen pipes (into infants  windpipes) after birth, and proper medication was also not given,  police said in the complaint, quoting the government report.  The investigation suggested that 30 of a total of 49 children died of perinatal asphyxia, police added in the complaint, seen by Reuters. This condition is caused by a reduced level of oxygen in infants just before, during or after delivery, depriving them of the ability to breathe freely. A district magistrate on Wednesday ordered the inquiry into the deaths of the infants, after media reports linked some deaths to oxygen shortages. He also ordered action against all the doctors involved in the deaths.  The district s chief medical superintendent, Dr Akhilesh Agarwal, denied there had been any lack of oxygen.  The hospital saved 121 of the 145 infants admitted in critical condition following their birth elsewhere, he added.   The rest died since their conditions were critical,  he told Reuters. Nineteen more babies were born dead in the government hospital, and the six remaining, from the tally of 49 in the government report, died of unspecified causes, he added, without elaborating. India spends about one percent of its GDP on public health, among the lowest in the world.  Successive governments have faced criticism for not reforming the overburdened public health system which is still plagued with a shortage of doctors and dilapidated infrastructure. In recent years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi s government has increased health spending and vowed to make healthcare more affordable. ",1.0
 Paul Ryan Quotes Mel Gibson In A Desperate Attempt To Not Be The Next John Boehner,"Paul Ryan is learning quickly that John Boehner had good reason to cry all the time. The Speaker of the House of Representatives is the leader of his or her party. The third most powerful person in the free world. Speakers enjoy visibility and influence above and beyond any other representative in the chamber.That s how it used to be, anyway, when the speaker was a position respected by their own party. From the days of Tip O Neil and Tom Foley to Dennis Hastert and even Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House commanded respect.Unfortunately for Republicans, their base began to die off and they needed to replenish, so they decided to go ahead and back the super-zealots of the Tea Party, who have now morphed into the  Freedom Caucus,  and things will never be the same. There have always been fringe-right congressmen and women. Michele Bachmann wasn t the first complete moron to deny science on the house floor, but she was one of the first to be counted among dozens who have actually come together to mold the Republican party platform into something even more conservative and stubborn than we re all used to.They pushed John Boehner right out of office and back to Ohio. They held the seat hostage until they found someone they could agree would do as much damage as possible. They grudgingly allowed Ryan to be elected, lest Nancy Pelosi steal the seat out from under the party, but promised that the honeymoon wouldn t last long.So far it s been easy for Ryan. Everything coming down the pike has been party-line and cut-and-dry. All of that will change when the budget process comes around again and the deal struck last year to pass the omnibus package has to stay glued together. The last thing Ryan and the Republicans want is for the Democrats to be able to point at them and laugh, yet again, because they couldn t be bothered to put aside their internal differences and govern. To quote William Wallace in Braveheart,  Paul Ryan said on Wednesday morning,  we have to unite the clans.  It was the single sound bite he released to the press before a meeting of congressional conservatives. Uniting the clans, as he is finding out, is going to take a lot more than condescending looks towards the President during State of the Union addresses.He was fresh out of a meeting just half a day earlier that the Huffington Post said  did not go well  with those Freedom Caucus members whose entire purpose in Washington is to return the United States to 1789 and force a do-over, with the several states ruling themselves and the Federal government being a non-existent figure-head good for dinners with world leaders and state funerals.Ryan probably expected a long run when he accepted the job as speaker. If he can t gain control of his own party, he may be looking for a new job sooner than later.Featured Image by Gage Skidmore ",0.0
CHARLIE DANIELS ON OBAMAS FINAL YEAR: Never send a boy to do a mans job.,"Legendary singer and great patriot Charlie Daniels has been an outspoken critic of the Obama administration in the past but THIS is the best ever overview of the drip, drip, drip of Muslim refugees coming to every town in the U.S: If what happened in Cologne and other cities in Germany on New Years Eve, when young Muslim men insulted, groped, robbed and raped German women who were on the street celebrating the holiday doesn t wake Germany up, they are in for a long and probably irreversible ride.Angela Merkel s reckless act of allowing one million refugees into the country may seem like a great humanitarian gesture to some, but as the ramifications of such a foolish move begin to reach street level, Germany will be in for a long, national nightmare.The grotesque acts that occurred on New Year s Eve were not isolated incidents, but happened nationwide with the earmarks of single intentioned flash mobs operating in numbers too large to control and overtaxing the law enforcement personnel available to deal with it.Some of the ones who were detained told police that they couldn t do anything to them, that they had been invited into Germany by Ms. Merkel, as if that was a license to harass and abuse the girls without consequences.A million people from another culture, who practice another religion, who have no regard for women s rights and who believe that Western Society is decadent, who refuse to assimilate and don t believe they are bound by the laws of the host country, is a lot to turn loose on any society at one time, and New Year s Eve was just a small harbinger of things to come. Even if the troublemakers represent just 2 percent of the population of refugees, that is still approximately 20,000 people that can cause a lot of problems for Germany.This is before the terrorist component has made itself known. Merkel, in her rush to out politically correct other world leaders has imported the agents of death into her country. The genie is out of the bottle, and German children will suffer the ramifications of Angela Merkel s folly for generations to come. In rejecting a 200,000 limit on the number of refugees entering the country, it seems Merkel plans to allow even more refugees in 2016.It s too late for Germany. They have opened the zoo, and lions walk among them. Soon the terror attacks will begin, and the Muslim population explosion will, in relatively few years, create a significant voting block that will grow exponentially. Unlike native Germans who abort millions of their unborn each year, most Muslims don t practice abortion, and their tradition of having multiple children per family only accelerates the process.And once again, we are beaten over the head with the truth that  not all Muslims are terrorists,  but it doesn t take a majority to be dangerous.It s not too late for America, despite the fact that Obama seems determined to expose our society to the same dangers that Germany faces.This president has a weak spot for things Muslim. Whether it s his father s heritage, his upbringing, his education at an Indonesian madrassa or a combination of all of the above, I just don t know. It s apparent every time he talks about the  holy Koran  or the  Prophet  with such reverence, and it also reveals itself in his insistence that Islam has absolutely nothing to do with terrorism.He got taken to the cleaners by the Mullahs in Iran, who actually did little besides promise not to develop a nuclear device for 15 years, and since their word has all the value of a Zimbabwean penny, nobody but Obama believes they ll honor the terms of his incredibly weak deal   a deal that unfreezes billions of dollars which Iran will no doubt use to continue funding terror.In fact, Iran may have already violated the treaty by taking United States sailors, whose boats reportedly drifted into Iranian waters, into custody and subjecting them to humiliation, even broadcasting it on television all over the Islamic world to show how impotent the  Great Satan  really is.By the time they freed our sailors, they had pulled off a public relations coup farther emphasizing their disrespect and their opinion of just how weak, ineffective and disengaged they consider Obama to be.All of this doesn t seem to bother Obama though. He is determined to turn over one hundred and fifty billion dollars to this bunch of loose cannons, and he seems bent on bringing in thousands (tip of Obama s iceberg) of Muslim refugees, when we have already been told that ISIS has infiltrated operatives into the numbers.I believe that the only thing that protects America from further insults and aggression from Putin, China and anybody else who has an ax to grind with us is the grace of God and the fact that our enemies are afraid that America may elect a president with some backbone and the courage and guts to protect our interests.While there is a whole world out there that respects only power and those willing to use it, Obama extended a limp olive branch, which has been snatched out of his hand and is being used to beat him with.Never send a boy to do a man s job.What do you think?Pray for our troops and the peace of JerusalemGod Bless AmericaCharlie DanielsCharlie Daniels is a legendary American singer, song writer, guitarist, and fiddler famous for his contributions to country and southern rock music.

"ESPN SENIOR WRITER Says COPS, SOLDIERS Singing At Ballparks Is Racist Show Of PowerSays 9/11 Police Officers Arent Heroes [VIDEO]","What happens when a black police officer sings the national anthem at a ball park? Is that racist as well? When will Disney owned ESPN figure out their fans aren t watching for their ignorant, racist commentary? ESPN Magazine  senior writer Howard Bryant argued in has latest column that police officers and military personnel should not sing the national anthem before sporting events.But it s not because he thinks they have bad voices   but rather because it amounts to a display of  staged patriotism  signaling an  authoritarian shift at the ballpark. Why don t more athletes speak out on behalf of their communities?  Bryant wrote.  Perhaps more of them would if there wasn t a chilling force looming over them. Bryant s column became a subject on a  Fox and Friends Weekend  segment, and the gang totally disagreed with him.Anna Kooiman noted that Bryant had written similar columns, in which he took the exception to  doing the flyovers and singing the national anthem and  God Bless America. In today s political climate, where kids in some district can t recite the Pledge of Allegiance, she asked  What is the problem here with expressing some patriotism? It s not forced patriotism! Peter Doocy said that, according to Bryant, these displays are  feeding into the 9/11 hero narrative,  which butts heads with the Black Lives Matter movement.He does not believe that police officers on 9/11 were heroes,  he said, and then wondered why a sporting magazine was opining about politics in the first place.

U.S. Republican senator moves toward re-election despite Trump tiff,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Another U.S. Republican senator has moved closer to re-election while keeping some distance from Donald Trump, and experts say this suggests the partys presidential candidate may be having little down-ballot impact, at least at the primary stage.  Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire still faces a tough general election challenge on Nov. 8 but she crushed a pro-Trump, Republican challenger in a primary contest on Tuesday, winning close to 80 percent of the vote. Ayotte has refused to endorse Trump although, like a number of Republicans, she has said she will vote for him. Some Republicans, such as Ohio Senator Rob Portman, have endorsed Trump but excluded him from their campaigns. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska won her primary in August although she had said she did not know whether she would vote for Trump. Trump, a New York businessman who has never held elected office, at first criticized Ayotte. Then he changed course early last month and endorsed her, along with fellow Republicans House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator John McCain. With Ayottes victory, all incumbent Republican senators running for re-election have won their primaries this year. This is not uncommon but it is unusual for so many senators to hold their partys presidential nominee at arms length.  U.S. senators serve six-year-terms. One-third of the 100-member Senate faces voters every two years. The outcome so far shows some voters are distinguishing this year between Trump and the rest of the ballot, said Nathan Gonzales, editor of The Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report, a non-partisan newsletter.  His impact has been less dramatic than what was initially expected, but there is still time for things to get worse for the Republican Party, Gonzales said in a telephone interview. At a time when Republicans in presidential primaries basically rejected everybody from the status quo, they are not doing that in Senate or House primaries, Norman Ornstein, a political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, said by telephone. Republicans are still worried that voters who do not like Trump will not turn out to vote for other Republicans in the general election on Nov. 8, Gonzales said.  Is there a Trump drag (on down-ballot candidates)? There doesnt appear to be much of one, said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor at the non-partisan Cook Political Report. Ohios Portman, who has not appeared with Trump on the campaign trail, easily beat his primary opponent and has opened up a lead over his Democratic challenger in the general election. McCain and Ryan have had very public differences of opinion with Trump but they also prevailed in their primary races. Ayotte beat a field of four challengers in New Hampshire, receiving nearly 80 percent of the vote, according to election results posted online by the state.  She must still take on Democratic New Hampshire Governor Maggie Hassan in the general election. Ayotte was leading Hassan by 52 percent to 44 percent in a Sept. 6-8 NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll, according to the website RealClear Politics. I think you probably have a lot of people in the primary who were not going to pay as close attention to what she was saying about Trump, Ornstein said of Ayotte.

U.S. calls for U.N. to impose strongest measures on North Korea,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Monday it was time for the U.N. Security Council to impose  the strongest possible measures  on North Korea over its sixth and largest nuclear test because  enough is enough.   Haley said the incremental sanctions approach of the 15-member council to North Korea since 2006 had not worked and she described North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as  begging for war.    Despite our efforts the North Korea nuclear program is more advanced and more dangerous than ever,  Haley told the council.  War is never something the United States wants. We don t want it now. But our country s patience is not unlimited.  ",1.0
LISTEN TO JEH JOHNSONS BIZARRE REASON We Must Remove Confederate StatuesHomeland Security Threat? [Video],"This is rich! The guy who opened our borders to criminals during the Obama era is now telling us that statues are a homeland security threat?  Former Obama administration official Jeh Johnson said on This Week with Martha Raditz that the removal of Confederate statues was a matter of  public safety and homeland security  on Sunday Oh brother!A single protest against the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee turned violent last week. Charlottesville, WV was the sight of the engineered confrontation of two groups that got out of hand because the police officers were told to stand down.Jeh Johnson served as Secretary of Homeland Security under Obama but failed miserably to keep our homeland secure. We now have a mess that President Trump is trying to clean up. Johnson allowed violent gangs like MS13 to enter towns across America. He allowed thousands of illegal alien minor children to just roam free. Johnson is responsible for much of the illegal alien crime we re seeing now. The lawless policy of Obama and Johnson hurt many Americans.So now Johnson is saying that it s a problem that rallying Americans who want to keep Confederate statues are the violent ones??? THE VIOLENCE IS COMING FROM ANTIFA AND BLACK LIVES MATTER ON THE LEFT!THIS IS NOT TRUE:  What alarms so many of us from a security perspective is that so many of the statues, the Confederate monuments, are now, modern-day, becoming symbols and rallying points for white nationalism, for neo-Nazis, for the KKK, and this is most alarming,  Johnson said.  We fought a world war against Naziism. The KKK reigned terror on African Americans for generations. I salute those in cities and states who are taking down a lot of these monuments for reasons of public safety and security,  he added.  And that s not a a matter of political correctness. That s a matter of public safety and homeland security and doing what s right. Host Martha Raddatz said she felt the Trump administration would call that a  slippery slope,  referring to local Washington locations like Washington-Lee High School and Jefferson Davis Highway. Where should that stop?  Raddatz asked.Johnson said those kinds of decisions should be made at the local level.President Donald Trump slammed the removal of such monuments as  foolish  and for ripping apart the  history and culture of our great country.

 Mitch McConnell Freezes GOP Donors Into Loudest Silence EVER With One Question About Trump,"It s become a weekly ritual: Trump goes through each day, doing his Trumpian thing, and at the end of the week, various media outlets are recapping  Trump s bad week.  This week, though, seems to have been especially bad for Trump, because Republicans are frightened. They re frustrated. They re confused. And they don t think he ll win the election.At a private fundraiser for Rep. Joseph Heck (R-NV), Mitch McConnell asked the room of Republican supporters whether they think Trump can win. Maybe half raised their hands. When he asked whether they think Trump will win, however, the room fell silent, and not one person was able to raise their hand.Not. One. Person. In that room. Thinks Trump will win in November.The silence in that room had to deafening. It s certainly telling. When your own party s donors don t believe you will win your election, you ve got a huge problem.For his part, McConnell refuses to talk about Trump to the press. When they caught up with him, he was curt, saying,  This is not something I am going to discuss today,  and then,  Because I choose not to,  when they pressed him on why.Even one of Trump s staunchest allies, Newt Gingrich, thinks his 3am tweetstorm about the  dishonest  press was wholly inappropriate to someone who wants to be president:.@newtgingrich said @realDonaldTrump has  got to become much more disciplined.  Do you agree? #Hannity pic.twitter.com/rKLuqhpHIA  Fox News (@FoxNews) October 1, 2016For his part and this is probably one of the most maddening things for Republicans Trump sees his behavior as exactly what s needed in a president.

 Trumps Ego Goes Into Overdrive As He Retweets Anyone Who Kisses His A** Over Withdrawal From Paris Climate Accord,"Donald Trump is so desperate to hear praise that he is retweeting anyone who congratulates him for withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate deal.In an effort to prevent and reverse climate change, the developing nations of the world came together in Paris, France and agreed to curb their carbon emissions.Trump, however, is a climate change denier. So he promised to pull America out of the deal and he did exactly that on Thursday. In order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord,  Trump announced.  We re getting out. And then he referred to himself in the third person and patted himself on the back. The Paris accord is a bad deal for Americans and the President s action today is keeping his campaign promise to put America first. The accord was negotiated poorly by the Obama administration out of desperation. Trump s decision has spurred outrage across the nation and around the globe as world leaders feel that the United States has betrayed them. One of the big reasons why the Paris Agreement became reality is because the United States led the way. Now America is retreating from that leadership role.However, Trump was only interested in hearing praise for his monumentally moronic decision, so he proceeded to retweet anyone who kissed his ass, including Lindsey Graham, Reince Priebus, and Kevin McCarthy.I support President Trump s desire to re-enter the Paris Accord after the agreement becomes a better deal for America and business.

American McCarthyism: Neocon Warhawks Plan to Kill Antiwar Dissent in Media,"21st Century Wire says After 12 months of perpetrating one of the greatest political hoaxes in history   blaming Russia for the Presidential victory of Donald Trump   the Washington establishment is now wanting to take the lie to the next level by sanctioning not only Russian international media outlets, but any media outlet (see one of their guide lists here) who dare to violate the mainstream party line on the US war agenda by broadcasting to an America audience  forcing them the register as  foreign agents  under the FARA Act of 1934.

Kurdish-led Syrian groups plan to attend Sochi talks: officials,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Kurdish-led Syrian groups plan to attend Russia s proposed Syria peace talks in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Kurdish officials have said. The Syria peace congress was originally scheduled for Nov. 18 but was postponed and the Kremlin said on Thursday that no new date had been set. If the invitation is renewed,  we will attend Sochi and every other meeting that concerns the Syrian crisis as representatives of the people s will  Sihanouk Depo, an official of Syria s main Kurdish party, PYD, told an affiliated website on Wednesday.  We are still invited,  Badran Jia Kurd, a senior Kurdish official, told Reuters on Thursday. If the framework for the congress still stands,  we will attend , said Jia Kurd, an adviser to the administration that governs Kurdish-led autonomous regions of Syria. It would mark the first time Syria s main Kurdish groups are brought into peace talks. Although they now run at least a quarter of Syria, they have so far been left out of international talks in line with Turkish wishes. Before the Sochi talks were postponed, the PYD said in November it had been invited and favored attending. Since the conflict erupted in 2011, the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and its allies have carved out autonomous cantons in the north. The YPG spearheads the Syrian Democratic Forces, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias fighting Islamic State militants with Washington s backing.  Their territorial grip has expanded since joining forces with the United States, though Washington opposes their autonomy plans.  Turkey views the PYD and the YPG as offshoots of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought a decades-long insurgency inside Turkey. Last month, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan s spokesman said Russia had told Ankara that the PYD would not be invited to the peace talks.    The Kurdish groups share enmities with both Syrian President Bashar al-Assad s government and with neighboring Turkey. This week, Assad described the U.S.-backed militias as  traitors . On Wednesday, in an interview with Iran s Arabic language Al-Alam television, Syria s deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad equated the Kurdish-led forces with Islamic State.  There is another Daesh called SDF,  he said, using the Arabic acronym for the militant group that until recently controlled swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria. In his interview on Wednesday, Depo said:  Any attack from the regime will be a failed venture.  ",1.0

Trump close to picking outside counsel for Russia probe: Washington Post,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is seeking outside counsel to help him during investigations into his campaign and Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, and has narrowed the search to four prominent attorneys, the Washington Post reported on Monday. The lawyers who have spoken to the White House and are widely seen as the finalists are Marc Kasowitz; Robert Giuffra Jr.; Reid Weingarten; and Theodore Olson, the Post said, citing four people briefed on the discussions. The Post said the four spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Giuffra met with Trump in the Oval Office on Friday, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. The person also said Kasowitz may have had dinner with Trump on Thursday. A White House spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the meetings. Names could still be added to the list, but two people close to the search told the Post that Trump wants a team of attorneys rather than a single lawyer to represent him. It cited them as saying the team is likely to have lead counselors. The four attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment, the Post said, and they did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters. A White House official told the Post that the administration had no comment at the time. The outside counsel would be separate from the White House Counsels Office, which is led by Donald McGahn, who served as the Trump campaigns lawyer. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow tried to sway the November vote in Trumps favor. Russia has denied involvement, and Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia. ",1.0
"AUSTRIAN Schools Are Being Radicalized By Young Muslim Migrants: If She Doesnt Obey [Wear Hijab], Ill Just Murder Her [VIDEO]","This story is a perfect example of how Muslim migrants do NOT assimilate in their host countries.

Final death toll from London's Grenfell Tower fire is 71: police,"LONDON (Reuters) - The final death toll from the fire that destroyed the Grenfell Tower social housing block in London in June is 71, police said on Thursday after five months of painstaking search and recovery operations. Police had previously said about 80 people died in the blaze, which tore through the 24-storey tower in west London in the middle of the night, but officers now believe all those who died in the fire have been recovered and identified. The figure has come down because some people were reported missing several times, some people who lived in the tower and were feared dead were found to have been elsewhere on the night, and some people were falsely reported dead by fraudsters hoping to receive financial compensation. The final toll includes 70 adults and children who died in the tower during the fire, and one baby who was stillborn shortly after the heavily pregnant mother escaped from the 21st floor, suffering severe smoke inhalation on her way down. The mother survived.  Specialist teams working inside Grenfell Tower and the mortuary have pushed the boundaries of what was scientifically possible to identify people,  said Metropolitan Police Commander Stuart Cundy, who is in charge of operations at the tower.  I know that each and every member of the team has done absolutely all they can to make this possible. They have done that for every person who lost their life, their families and loved ones, and all those for whom Grenfell Tower was home.  The tower was home to a tight-knit, multi-ethnic community in a deprived social housing estate within the wealthy Kensington and Chelsea borough that is also home to large numbers of millionaires. The tragedy has prompted political debate and soul-searching about London s stark social inequalities and whether neglect of social housing estates and the communities living in them played a part in the fire. A criminal investigation is under way that could result in individuals or organizations being charged. A separate public inquiry aims to shed light on any flaws or irregularities in the design, construction or maintenance of the tower. Cundy said that when he first entered Grenfell Tower after the fire, the devastation was such that he feared it would not be possible to find, recover and identify all those who died. Police officers, assisted by forensic anthropologists, archaeologists and specialists in using dental science to identify unknown human remains, searched every flat on every floor and every communal area. The search involved sifting through tonnes of debris by hand to identify all human remains in the charred building. In parallel, huge amounts of investigative work was undertaken to identify who was in Grenfell Tower on the night of the fire, who was missing and presumed dead, enquire after those reported missing and reconcile all the information. One person was reported missing 46 separate times. Some were reported under a number of different names, and even the slightest differences in spelling had to be investigated. Police said that having completed all this work, they now believed it was highly unlikely that anyone remained in Grenfell Tower. ",1.0
LAVAR BALL: Heres Why President Trump Was Under No Legal Obligation To Help Release Your Shoplifting Son From Chinese Prison,"Before Lavar Ball, the ungrateful father of accused criminal, and UCLA basketball player, LiAngelo Ball, goes off on a public rant about how unappreciative he for President Trump s help, when he interceded on behalf of his son and 2 other UCLA basketball players, who were caught shoplifting at a Louis Vuitton store in China, he may want to consider, that without the help of President Trump, his son could be sitting in a Chinese prison for the next 10 years.Lavar Ball might also want to consider that President Trump was under no obligation to ask President Xi to get involved in the public relations nightmare that took place while our President was a guest in China, to help negotiate their release, and here s why   Days after President Donald Trump touted his role in the release of three UCLA basketball students who were arrested in China, LaVar Ball, the father of one of those players, suggested the President had little to do with the matter. Who?  Ball told ESPN when asked about Trump s involvement in the situation.  What was he over there for? Don t tell me nothing. Everybody wants to make it seem like he helped me out. They try to make a big deal out of nothing sometimes.  I m from L.A. I ve seen a lot worse things happen than a guy taking some glasses.    LaVar Ball, father of UCLA player with  sticky fingers Law Newz   Our Tweeter-in-Chief lashed out on Twitter Sunday after Ball, a businessman, and ex-basketball player, downplayed POTUS  role in helping release son LiAngelo Ball from Chinese custody.Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail, LaVar Ball, the father of LiAngelo, is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal. I should have left them in jail!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2017 I should have left them in jail,  Trump wrote. That s a hell of thing to tweet, and it grabbed a lot of attention. Outlets like Mediaite, The NY Times, Fox News, and ESPN were all over it. But as with many things in this administration, it s always helpful to review a president s role in situations like this.To recap, we have three Americans UCLA basketball players LiAngelo Ball, Jalen Hill and Cody Riley arrested by Chinese authorities for alleged shoplifting. Trump took credit for their return to the states, saying he asked the country s president Xi Jinping for help. Now we have that same president saying he should ve done nothing.What does it mean if provable spite motivated a president s decision to refrain from helping an American held in custody on foreign soil? Law&Crime reached out to Harvard Law Professor Noah Feldman for his take on the matter and asked if such behavior, or something like it, could be impeachable. Not impeachable,  Feldman wrote in an email.  He was under no duty to help and no duty to be nice about it after the fact. ",0.0

They re the work of a street artist known as Plastic Jesus, who s previously focused most of his work on the entertainment industry. According to LAist, though, these signs are something different, and not just because they re political: We re seeing detention of travelers to the U.S. They have all the proper credentials, but they re being detained for the country they re coming from, as well as their race. I have a friend who was detained because her name was Lebanese. She was detained for a couple hours and was questioned. This was someone who has a visa. Lebanon isn t on Trump s list. It s normal for U.S. Customs and Border Protection to briefly question foreign nationals from everywhere before granting them admission to the country, and it s true that we don t know all the specific circumstances surrounding these detentions. However, the amount of hours-long detention for people who seem to otherwise check out (are traveling on the proper visa, have the rest of their travel documents and itineraries in order, etc.) is alarming.Not only are people being unnecessarily, and even wrongly, delayed prior to entering the U.S., but Trump is working to ramp up deportation, including increasing funding for  detention beds,  for immigrants awaiting deportation. To ramp up the deportation process the way Trump wants could eventually require camps, since detention centers aren t big enough, probably won t be made big enough, and deporting someone isn t as simple as picking them up and driving them across the border.The signs reference Executive Order 9066, which is the order FDR signed to create the Japanese internment camps we had during WWII. The idea of camps for immigrants, people who are prohibited from entering the U.S. due to Trump s new travel ban but can t be turned around immediately, and possibly more, is eerily evocative of that.There s some backlash, but when art gets political like this, there will always be backlash. The idea is to stir people up and make them take notice of the events unfolding around them.Featured image by John Moore via Getty Images",0.0
 Trump Campaign Renews Attack On Military Family (AUDIO),"An official representative of Donald Trump s presidential campaign has once again launched an attack on the family of fallen soldier Captain Humayun Khan.This time the attack comes from conservative Carl Paladino, the New York co-chair of the Trump for President Campaign.In a radio interview with Imus in the Morning, Paladino argued that Khizr Khan, Khan s father who gave a rousing speech to the Democratic Convention, does not deserve to be called a  Gold Star parent  even though he lost his son in combat in Iraq in 2004. We ve got an un-indicted felon as his opponent and you re talking about Khan, about him making a remark about this man,  Paladino, a former New York gubernatorial candidate, told interviewer Connell McShane on Imus in the Morning.  All right, I don t care if he s a Gold Star parent. He certainly doesn t deserve that title, OK, if he s as anti-American as he s illustrated in his speeches and in his discussion. I mean, if he s a member of the Muslim Brotherhood or supporting, you know, the ISIS-type of attitude against America, there s no reason for Donald Trump to have to honor this man. The Trump campaign s heartless attacks against the Khans have received widespread condemnation across America, with even some Trump supporters saying that the line was crossed in attacking the family. Trump himself belittled the family s sacrifices, pointing to his work as a real estate developer as comparable to losing a child. Trump also insinuated that Khan s wife didn t speak at the convention because of her Islamic faith.In subsequent comments she said she did not speak because she is still overwhelmed when speaking about how her child was lost.By comparison, the Khan family s sacrifice has been repeatedly praised by Hillary Clinton, her running mate Tim Kaine, and other Democrats. It is strange that in light of Trump s collapsing support in national polls that his campaign would return to this topic.Featured image via YouTube",0.0
North Korea not ready to meet with South Korea in Russia: agencies,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Politicians from North and South Korea will not hold direct talks in Russia on Monday about Pyongyangs nuclear and missile program despite attending the same event and being urged to do so by Moscow, Russian news agencies said on Sunday. Valentina Matviyenko, speaker of Russias upper house of parliament, is due to discuss the missile crisis in separate talks with a deputy head of North Koreas legislature and the head of South Koreas parliament on the sidelines of a congress of parliamentarians in St Petersburg on Monday. Moscow has called on the two countries to use the opportunity to have their own direct talks to try to narrow their differences.  But the RIA news agency on Sunday cited Piotr Tolstoi, the deputy speaker of the Russian lower house of parliament, and an unnamed member of North Koreas delegation as saying there would not be any direct talks. The unnamed North Korean delegate was quoted as saying that U.S. pressure on Pyongyang and U.S. and South Korean military exercises meant preconditions for such talks had not been met. Konstantin Kosachyov, head of the upper house of parliaments foreign affairs committee, said Moscow would try again on Monday to encourage the two delegations to hold face-to-face talks despite the lack of progress. Russian news agencies quoted him as saying that the North Korean delegation had so far declined to hold such talks, while the South Korean delegation had said it was ready for such a meeting. We will definitely not try to coerce or talk somebody into anything, the Interfax news agency cited Kosachyov as saying.  (But) it will be pity, both on the human and political level, if another opportunity to de-escalate tensions in relations between North Korea and South Korea is missed. North Koreas nuclear tests and missile launches have stirred global tensions and prompted several rounds of international sanctions at the U.N. Security Council. A de-escalation plan, backed by Russia and China, would see North Korea suspend its ballistic missile program and the United States and South Korea simultaneously call a moratorium on large-scale missile exercises, both moves aimed at paving the way for multilateral talks.

Turkish police arrest 15 senior military officers in Gulen probe: Anadolu,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish police arrested 15 senior military officers in an investigation into the network of a U.S.-based cleric who Ankara accuses of orchestrating last year s attempted coup, state-run Anadolu news agency said on Friday. It said police were seeking one more officer in the operation, focused on the capital Ankara and spread across nine provinces, adding that 12 of the total 16 suspects were serving officers. Among the suspects were seven colonels and nine lieutenant colonels from Turkey s gendarmerie force, which maintains security in rural areas, the Hurriyet news website said. More than 50,000 people, including security personnel and civil servants, have been jailed pending trial in the aftermath of the failed putsch, which the government blames on Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen. He has denied involvement.     Some 150,000 people have also been suspended or dismissed in a crackdown which rights groups say has been used as a pretext to muzzle dissent but which the government says has been necessary due to the security threats Turkey faces. Police operations targeting alleged followers of Gulen have been conducted on a near daily basis since the coup attempt in July 2016, and authorities issued arrest warrants for 44 teachers on Friday, Anadolu said. The suspects were former teachers at Gulen-linked schools which were previously closed by state decree, Anadolu said. Twenty-eight of the teachers were arrested so far. Schools linked to Gulen s network have been established across Asia, Africa and the United States and since the putsch, Turkey has asked countries including Afghanistan and Pakistan to close them down.

U.S. appeals injunction of Trump revised travel order,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday appealed a ruling by a federal judge in Hawaii extending a suspension of President Donald Trumps revised restrictions on travel from some Muslim-majority countries. The appeal will be considered by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, which last month upheld a suspension of Trumps first travel order. Trump signed the revised ban earlier this month in a bid to overcome legal problems with a January executive order that caused chaos at airports and sparked mass protests before a Washington judge stopped its enforcement in February. Trump has said the travel ban is needed for national security. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson on Wednesday turned an earlier temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit brought by the state of Hawaii. The case challenged Trumps travel directive as unconstitutional religious discrimination. Hawaii and other opponents of the ban claim it is based on Trumps election campaign promise of a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. The court will not crawl into a corner, pull the shutters closed, and pretend it has not seen what it has, Watson wrote on Wednesday. The Justice Department on Thursday also asked a Seattle federal judge to suspend separate litigation filed by Washington state against Trumps travel restrictions until after the 9th Circuit rules on the Hawaii appeal. In addition, the Justice Department earlier this month appealed a ruling from a Maryland judge against Trumps revised executive order. That case will be heard by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia. ",1.0

Senator Grassley to meet Garland despite opposition to nominee ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley has invited Judge Merrick Garland to breakfast, but absent from the menu will be any promise of hearings on President Barack Obamas nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court. A spokeswoman for Grassley said that the Republican senator spoke with Garland late on Monday and extended the invitation where they could discuss the nomination and why the Senate will not consider a nominee until the next president takes office. The Senate Judiciary Committee is in charge of holding hearings on Supreme Court nominees chosen by the president and deciding whether to recommend full Senate confirmation. Most of the Senates 54 Republicans have indicated opposition to confirming any high-court nominee of Obamas, saying the choice should be made by the next president, who would be elected on Nov. 8 and sworn in on Jan. 20, 2017. Despite the wall of Republican opposition to Garland, who is considered a moderate federal appeals court judge, Obama and his fellow Democrats continue to push for Senate confirmation this year. Garland already has made several courtesy calls to senators, mostly Democrats, and will continue his visits to Capitol Hill this week. If he were to be confirmed, Garland - nominated to fill the vacancy created by the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia - would tilt the Supreme Court to the left for the first time in decades. The race for a replacement for Obama, who is completing his second and final term as president, is in full swing now with billionaire businessman Donald Trump leading two other Republican candidates and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. But it could be weeks or months before the two political parties settle on their respective candidates. A date for the breakfast meeting has not yet been set, Grassleys spokeswoman said.",1.0

The vigil was led by people from Charlottesville and across the country who had marched 118 miles from downtown Charlottesville to Washington to call for all white supremacists to be removed from government, including the President.One of the organizers:  It speaks volumes about our country that a permit would be issued for a white supremacist rally, yet our nonviolent 24-hour vigil against our white supremacist government would be broken up by a public institution. We are disappointed, frustrated, but resolved. We took as many reasonable steps as we could in the time available to us, but still had many donated goods to support the march and the vigil confiscated.

BUSINESS OWNERS GET RICH Providing Luxury Housing And Gourmet Food To Refugees Who Complain Its Not Enough,"Meanwhile,  refugees  staying at these luxury hotels in England cry  discrimination  because they re not allowed to eat same food, and enjoy all of the same amenities as  paying guests. The fat cat boss of a company given vast amounts of taxpayers  money to house asylum seekers is on a salary of almost  1million a year, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.MPs have condemned James Vyvyan-Robinson, director of Clearspring Ready Homes Ltd, for profiteering from the plight of refugees after he awarded himself an astonishing near-fourfold pay rise.The company, which is paid by the Government to provide transportation and accommodation for asylum seekers, is currently under investigation by HMRC over its tax affairs.The asylum seekers come from countries such as Eritrea, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Angola and Morocco. Every morning they are treated to a full English breakfast, at lunch they have a selection of sandwiches and for dinner they are served with rice, chicken, pasta and vegetables.But some complain they are discriminated against because they have to eat their food in a function room away from other guests, who have to fork out  14.50 for buffet meals that include carvery meats, fish, vegetables, cheese and biscuits and desserts such as chocolate gateau.A Mail on Sunday reporter who stayed at the hotel as a guest last week witnessed an asylum seeker complaining to staff.The man, who has previously worked at hotels in Dubai, said:  We should be considered VIPs because we are long-staying guests. We are making money for this hotel. He said he fled his home country last summer after escaping an honour killing   and was heard complaining to a waiter:  Why the food is not the same quality, my brother? Why [other] people, they have salad and we don t have salad? Why they have desserts and we don t have desserts? Despite his complaints, he said he was grateful that the British taxpayer was funding his stay.A Libyan asylum seeker also complained about their treatment and that they were served different food to paying guests.Asylum seekers have been at the hotel since last October, with the length of their stays ranging from a few days to a few weeks before they are moved elsewhere.Prices range from  35 for a single room to  71 for a family-sized room, with the cost met by Clearsprings Ready Homes Ltd, a firm contracted by the Home Office. Astonishingly, the asylum seekers seemed to have been left unsupervised, with no Clearsprings staff on the premises during The Mail on Sunday s stay.The travel review website TripAdvisor is flooded with reviews from angry guests who say they were not warned about the asylum seekers before booking the hotel. Many said they were intimidated by large groups loitering at the lobby and bar.One guest even wrote:  I will not be returning unless a bulldozer has preceded me.  Another, describing the establishment as a  disgusting hell hole , said:  I was shocked at all the non-paying guests staying at the taxpayer s expense, courtesy of the Home Office, taking all the lounge areas.

Merkel wants EU to consider halting Turkish accession talks after vote,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday that Turkey was fast abandoning the rule of law and vowed to push her EU partners to consider suspending or ending its accession talks at a meeting in October. Less than three weeks before a German national election, she spelled out her intentions clearly to the Bundestag lower house of parliament after sharpening her rhetoric on Sunday and saying Turkey should not become an EU member. Those comments, made in a televised debate with her Social Democrat (SPD) election rival, drew charges of populism from Ankara. It was the latest of a series of spats between Merkel and President Tayyip Erdogan over the last two years which has led to a serious deterioration in relations.  Turkey is moving away from the path of the rule of law at a very fast speed,  Merkel said, adding her government would do everything it could to secure the release of Germans detained in Turkey, who Berlin says are innocent. The Foreign Ministry said last week 12 German citizens, four of them with dual citizenship, had been detained in Turkey on political charges. One has since been released. The ministry updated its travel advice on Tuesday and said that  incomprehensible  arrests were taking place all over Turkey, including regions frequented by tourists.  Venting her growing frustration, Merkel said a rethink of Germany s and the EU s relations with Turkey was needed.  We will also - and I will suggest this takes place at the EU meeting in October - discuss future relations with Turkey, including the question of suspending or ending talks on accession,  she said.  I will push for a decisive stand ... But we need to coordinate and work with our partners,  she said, adding that it would damage the EU if Erdogan saw member states embroiled in an argument.  That would dramatically weaken Europe s position.  Although Turkey s foreign minister has said EU membership remains a strategic goal, the EU has turned very skeptical - especially since Erdogan s crackdown on opponents after a failed coup in July 2016.  A European Commission spokesman said on Monday Turkey was taking  giant strides  away from Europe. Although her conservative party has long opposed Turkish membership of the bloc, Merkel has staked a good deal on maintaining relations with its NATO ally.  She has repeatedly defended an EU-Turkey migrant deal she championed last year because it helped to stem the flow of refugees fleeing war in the Middle East to western Europe.  Merkel said despite her own reservations, she had gone along with EU accession talks agreed by her SPD predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, mainly to ensure continuity in foreign policy. Erdogan accuses Germany of harboring plotters behind the 2016 coup attempt. Turkey has arrested about 50,000 people in its purges of state institutions and the armed forces. Ankara says the crackdown is necessary to ensure national security but many Western countries and human rights groups say it is an attempt by Erdogan to stifle all dissent. Erdogan also won sweeping new powers in a referendum in April. In the runup to the German election little divides the main parties, who currently share power in a grand coalition, on Turkey. SPD Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel in July said Germans should be careful if they traveled to Turkey and threatened steps that could hurt investment there.     ",1.0
"THEY KNEW! Federal Government Knew Flint, MI Water Was POISONED, Kept It Hidden10 Have Already Died","This story is for anyone who believes the government is capable of basic addition. Even though this news is out there for everyone to see, the Left continues to use this crisis as an opportunity to try to pin the gross negligence of the EPA on the Republican Governor of Michigan. Flint, MI is a Democrat ruled, crime ridden, poverty stricken hell-hole. Stay tuned for the  environmental injustice  narrative Obama will soon be pushing. He s just waiting for the right time to demand federal funds be funneled into Democrat ruled, failing cities across America you know, to prevent further environmental crises. We all know #BlackLivesMatter would have already been there if someone was able to pin this on the rich, white Republican Governor of MI The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency s top Midwest official said her department knew as early as April about the lack of corrosion controls in Flint s water supply   a situation that likely put residents at risk for lead contamination   but said her hands were tied in bringing the information to the public.Starting with inquiries made in February, the federal agency battled Michigan s Department of Environmental Quality behind the scenes for at least six months over whether Flint needed to use chemical treatments to keep lead lines and plumbing connections from leaching into drinking water. The EPA did not publicize its concern that Flint residents  health was jeopardized by the state s insistence that such controls were not required by law.Instead of moving quickly to verify the concerns or take preventative measures, federal officials opted to prod the DEQ to act, EPA Region 5 Administrator Susan Hedman told The Detroit News this week. Hedman said she sought a legal opinion on whether the EPA could force action, but it wasn t completed until November.The state didn t agree to apply corrosion controls until late July and didn t publicly concede until October that it erroneously applied the federal Lead and Copper Rule overseeing water quality.An EPA water expert, Miguel Del Toral, identified potential problems with Flint s drinking water in February, confirmed the suspicions in April and summarized the looming problem in a June internal memo. The state decided in October to change Flint s drinking water source from the corrosive Flint River back to the Detroit water system.Critics have charged Hedman with attempting to keep the memo s information in-house and downplaying its significance.As soon as the lack of corrosion controls became apparent, state and federal officials should have acted to protect the public, said Virginia Tech researcher Marc Edwards, whose water analysis in 2015 helped uncover Flint s lead contamination. At that point, you do not just have smoke, you have a three-alarm fire and should respond immediately,  said Edwards, who, along with the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, has obtained dozens of key documents related to Flint s crisis through public record requests.  There was no sense of urgency at any of the relevant agencies, with the obvious exception of Miguel Del Toral, and he was silenced and discredited. About five months after being alerted to the lack of corrosion controls, a researcher at Hurley Medical Center in Flint began in August detecting high levels of lead in the bloodwork of city children. Lead poisoning can cause learning disabilities and, at high levels, may lead to seizures, coma and death, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Hedman defended her agency s handling of the Flint water situation, saying her water quality staff repeatedly worked to convince the DEQ that corrosion controls were needed   to no avail. Let s be clear, the recommendation to DEQ (regarding the need for corrosion controls) occurred at higher and higher levels during this time period,  Hedman said in a Detroit News interview.  And the answer kept coming back from DEQ that  no, we are not going to make a decision until after we see more testing results.   Michigan Governor Rick Snyder announced yesterday that 10 people have died from Legionnaire s disease in Flint, Mich. Eighty-seven cases of Legionnaire s disease have been found in and around Flint in the past 18 months.Flint s long-running water problems with drinking water have shaken Michigan s government, leading to last month s resignation of DEQ Director Dan Wyant and last week s state declaration of an emergency in the city. An independent task force appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder to review the situation placed the bulk of the blame for Flint s crisis on the DEQ.The federal government s actions are worth exploring, said Chris Kolb, co-chairman of the task force. We have made a request to speak with a number of EPA employees,  said Kolb, president of the Michigan Environmental Council and a former Democratic state representative.Flint s water crisis gained a national profile in the past week, as President Barack Obama s chief of staff said Sunday the White House is  very concerned  and is monitoring the situation  very closely.  Former Obama Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a Democratic presidential hopeful, called on the administration Tuesday to  step up  with assistance for Flint as well as do an  expedited review  of the city s water infrastructure.DEQ-EPA battleDEQ and EPA staffers were at loggerheads over dueling interpretations of the Lead and Copper Rule   a 25-year-old regulation designed to protect drinking water from metals contamination. The interpretation of the rule proved to be crucial after the city   under Snyder-appointed emergency managers   switched from Lake Huron water provided by the Detroit system to Flint River water as a cost-saving move in the spring of 2014.Following the switch, DEQ officials argued water testing, including two six-month periods of sampling, needed to be completed before making a decision on the need for corrosion controls. EPA officials, according to Hedman, wanted the controls implemented immediately out of concern for public health.If they knew Flint s lack of corrosion measures would likely result in lead reaching the drinking water   by June, testing would show it had   why didn t EPA officials inform the public when the DEQ failed to act?Hedman said federal law clearly lays out the state and federal responsibilities in overseeing safe drinking water. The EPA s role is to establish treatment standards and monitoring techniques, and provide technical assistance, she said. The state acts as the primary regulator of water operations. It is important to understand the clear roles here,  Hedman said.  Communication about lead in drinking water and the health impacts associated with that, that s the role of DHHS, the county health department and the drinking water utility. In addition, EPA officials argue that there wasn t sufficient early evidence for any sweeping steps to be taken.Hedman said the EPA talked with its legal counsel about its authority to compel action   a question that wouldn t be straightened out for months. In the interim, she said her agency urged Michigan to have its Department of Health and Human Services provide information on precautions for residents.EPA s lack of urgencyBut critics such as Edwards contend Hedman acted with no urgency, even behind the scenes. A week after the June 24 memo was circulated, an email exchange between Hedman and then-Flint Mayor Dayne Walling showed no sense of alarm over the threat to public health and more concern about procedure. The preliminary draft report should not have been released outside the agency,  Hedman wrote in the July 1 email.  When the report has been revised and fully vetted by EPA management, the findings and recommendations will be shared with the city and DEQ will be responsible for following up with the city. The revised and vetted memo was released four months later   in November. Edwards has described Del Toral s original memo as  100 percent accurate  in its assessment of the looming problem.Flint s drinking water ills led to the resignations last month of both Wyant and DEQ spokesman Brad Wurfel. It also caused the October reassignment of Liane Shekter Smith, then chief of DEQ s Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance. The crisis prompted Snyder to switch Flint back over to the Detroit water system in mid-October until a new regional water authority using Lake Huron as its source is completed later this year.Despite all of the moves, officials warn that unfiltered Flint water is still not safe to drink.There has been no fallout for federal environmental officials. There s been a failure at all levels to accurately assess the scale of the public health crisis in Flint, and that problem is ongoing,  said state Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich, D-Flint.  However, the EPA s Miguel Del Toral did excellent work in trying to expose this disaster. Anyone who read his memo and failed to act should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. Congressman Dan Kildee, D-Flint Township, stressed that the lion s share of responsibility for Flint s situation lies with the state DEQ.Yet he has questions about how the Lead and Copper Rule   ostensibly a safeguard for the public   may have contributed to EPA s response. If changes are necessary, he wants them made. There is a legitimate concern about EPA s performance in terms of alerting the public,  Kildee said.  And frankly, as a member of Congress, I want to know when there s the potential of a health crisis in my district.   Via: The Detroit News",0.0
U.S. agency seeks ideas for Trump's proposed border wall,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency said on Friday it will accept proposals next month for the design of a wall to be built near the U.S.-Mexican frontier, a first step in picking vendors for President Donald Trumps proposed border wall. In a document on the federal governments website for business opportunities, the CPB said it would release a request on or about March 6 asking companies for prototype ideas for a wall to be built near the U.S.-Mexican border. After reviewing the ideas submitted by vendors, the agency will evaluate and select the best designs by March 20, then issue a request for proposals by March 24 in which vendors would be asked to price out the cost of building the proposed wall. The document says multiple awards for the barrier are expected by mid-April as part of the process, an aggressive schedule for a government construction project. Its going to start soon. Way ahead of schedule, way ahead of schedule, Trump told the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday. A spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the solicitation published on Friday had everything to do with the wall that Trump has proposed. The spokesman said the initial request for information was to give industry the opportunity to tell the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CBP, what is possible in constructing a border wall. Once we get feedback from the vendors, well look at the ones that are most feasible, the spokesman said. That would be followed by the request for proposals to firm up exactly how much constructing the wall would cost. A U.S. Department of Homeland Security internal report seen by Reuters this month indicated the border wall would be a series of fences and walls that would cost as much as $21.6 billion to build and take more than three years to complete. The reports estimated price tag is much higher than a $12 billion figure cited by Trump in his campaign and estimates as high as $15 billion from Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The plan laid out what it would take to seal the border in three phases of construction of fences and walls covering just over 1,250 miles (2,000 km) by the end of 2020. With 654 miles (1,046 km) of the border already fortified, the new construction would extend almost the length of the entire border. ",1.0
 Verbal Diarrhea: Trump Gives Most Astonishingly Dumb Answer When Asked Who Abraham Lincoln Was,"It s no secret that Donald Trump talks to his supporters at an elementary school level, but even third graders would have to look at this answer to the question of  Why Abraham Lincoln was a successful president  and laugh. Trump, like a deer in headlights, delivers what may be the dumbest response ever delivered by a person hoping to bullshit his way through a question he can t answer.It s a beauty to behold.Trump sat down with legendary journalist Bob Woodward to cover a variety of topics. Trump, having clearly not prepared whatsoever, flailed spectacularly throughout. Just one example: I m a very inclusive person. I actually am somebody that gets along with people. And yet from a political standpoint, although I certainly have a lot of fans  you just said hello to Senator Sessions. It s enough to give Sarah Palin a run for her money for the Word Salad of the Year title.However, Trump s train finally derailed completely when Woodward asked him what he though the Republican Party stood for given its legacy as the Party of Abraham Lincoln. Trump responded as if he had never heard the name before.Well, I think Lincoln succeeded for numerous reasons. He was a man who was of great intelligence, which most presidents would be. But he was a man of great intelligence, but he was also a man that did something that was a very vital thing to do at that time. Ten years before or 20 years before, what he was doing would never have even been thought possible. So he did something that was a very important thing to do, and especially at that time.What did Abraham Lincoln do? Don t ask Trump, he just knows it was something  very vital  and  very important. The reaction on Twitter was unforgiving:.@katherinemiller That s verbal diarrhea not an answer to anything.  David Bohm (@DavidJBohm) April 5, 2016 This is like a 7th grade history paper.  @katherinemiller: Does Trump know what Abraham Lincoln did as president? pic.twitter.com/tCuiU1QIxZ  Yes, Nick $earcy! (@yesnicksearcy) April 5, 2016But there is another theory here. Perhaps Trump isn t dumber than a 5th grader. Perhaps he s just more racist than you dared suspect.The fact of the matter is that Trump s campaign has thrived on appealing to the portion of the American public most likely to ask  Why isn t there a White History month?  To many of his supporters, Lincoln s Emancipation Proclamation wasn t necessarily a good thing. A full 20 percent of his supporters say they thought it was a mistake. Some have even argued that African Americans were better off as slaves than  Democrats.  Trump supporter Ben Carson once mused that Obamacare was as bad as slavery.To talk about Lincoln s success is to talk about African Americans and to talk about African Americans is to not talk about the  silent majority  who claim it is white people who are oppressed. So, a good way to sidestep alienating your base is to talk in generalities. Lincoln succeeded  for numerous reasons.  He did  something  that was  vital.  It was  something  that was  very important to do.  Trump may think he has a great relationship with  the blacks  but it s the whites who come out by the thousands to vote for him   and he knows it.I m not sure which is worse: A Republican front-runner who can t articulate who Abraham Lincoln was or one who finds the Emancipation Proclamation so controversial that he can t even mention it as one of the former president s successes.Featured image via White House and Scott Olson/Getty Images",0.0

JBA is currently on lockdown due to a report of an active shooter. All personnel are directed to shelter in place. More info as it comes.  Joint Base Andrews (@JBA_NAFW) June 30, 2016There s only one problem with this story: we also learned that the base had planned a no-notice  Active Shooter Exercise scheduled for 9 am this morning, and as if by some amazing coincidence, during exercise, local first responders received emergency calls about a  real world  active shooter on the base. Still, this hasn t stopped flippant news anchors and  expert  analysts from US media outlets like CNN and FOX News from going into media-siege mode, and treating the event as if it were a real  active shooter  event   and injecting addition, unnecessary fear in the public discourse this morning.If one follows the inter-agency security protocols for a security exercise such as this, it would play out more or less exactly as it has today thus far, as evidenced by announcements by what other law enforcement and emergency services are saying.NBC News local affiliate adds here: Fort Belvoir in Virginia says it is increasing its  security posture  in response to the incident at Joint Base Andrews. It has advised its personnel to stay clear of Joint Base Andrews.  Last month Andrews had another  active  event, in what apparently turned-out to be a non-threat. Last month, Joint Base Andrews was placed on lockdown after a woman walked onto the base and claimed she had a bomb. An Explosive Ordinance Disposal team found the woman had no explosives, and she was apprehended.

DID MILITARY JUDGE Give Army Deserter Bowe Bergdahl A Slap On The Wrist Because of President Trump?,"Is this just one more case of an activist judge too blinded by his hate for Trump to deliver the justice he took an oath to uphold? It was announced yesterday that Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who walked away from his post in Afghanistan and triggered a search that left some of his comrades severely wounded, was spared a prison sentence by a military judge Friday in what President Donald Trump blasted as a  complete and total disgrace. The judge gave no explanation of how he arrived at his decision, but he reviewed evidence that included the five years Bergdahl was held captive by the Taliban and the wounds suffered by troops who searched for him, including one who now uses a wheelchair and cannot speak.  Chicago TribuneWhen candidate Donald Trump told a crowd that Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl should have been executed for leaving his post in Afghanistan, the crowd cheered We re tired of Sgt. Bergdahl, who s a traitor, a no-good traitor, who should have been executed,  Trump said to cheers at a rowdy rally inside a packed Las Vegas theater at the casino-hotel Treasure Island. Thirty years ago,  Trump added,  he would have been shot. Before everyone starts calling Trump  heartless  or an  idiot,  perhaps they should first familiarize themselves with our laws about Americans who commit treason:Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 807; Pub. L. 103 322, title XXXIII,  330016(2)(J), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2148.)Immediately after the news broke about the slap on the wrist given to Bowe Bergdahl in his desertion case, President Trump tweeted about his disgust with the judge s decision:https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/926492915626663939President Trump s harsh criticism of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who walked off his Army post in Afghanistan in 2009 and was captured by the Taliban, will weigh in favor of a lighter sentence for the sergeant, a military judge said on Monday. I will consider the president s comments as mitigation evidence as I arrive at an appropriate sentence,  the judge, Col. Jeffery R. Nance of the Army, said during a hearing at Fort Bragg. The judge is expected to sentence Sergeant Bergdahl in the next few weeks.The judge rejected a request that he dismiss the case or cap the length of the sentence on the grounds that the president s comments had precluded a fair hearing. The judge said he had not been influenced by the remarks and that the public s confidence in the military justice system had not been undermined.Sergeant Bergdahl faces up to life imprisonment. He pleaded guilty on Oct. 16 to desertion and endangering the troops who were sent to search for him.He testified on Monday that he deeply regretted that people  suffered because of my bad choices. Colonel Nance will also consider aggravating factors presented by the prosecution, including injuries suffered by several service members during the search for Sergeant Bergdahl, as well as the negative impact they say the search had on the military s overall war effort in Afghanistan.Anger over the injuries has driven much of the testimony in the case so far, as service members vividly described a rescue operation that exposed them to enemy fire. Shannon Allen, the wife of Sgt. First Class Mark Allen, who was shot in the head took the stand on Monday.Sergeant Allen, a national guardsman from Georgia, had part of his brain removed during surgery, and is now unable to speak, walk, or take care of himself. His wife has said little publicly, but in a Facebook post after Sergeant Bergdahl was freed, she blamed him for causing her husband s incapacitation. Instead of being his wife, I have become his caregiver,  Ms. Allen testified on Monday.Last week, Staff Sgt. Jason Walters testified that his six-man team had only just arrived in Afghanistan when they were sent to search for Sergeant Bergdahl. They had little time to prepare for the rugged terrain of Paktika Province, and little intelligence to go on.On the second morning of the search,  an insane amount of fire came out of nowhere,  Sergeant Walters said. Militants had them surrounded. In minutes, half the team had been wounded. Sergeant Walters turned to see  a cloud of blood  spraying from the head of Sergeant Allen. I started treating his wounds, talking to him, telling him to hang on,  Sergeant Walters said.The battle subsided only after F-15 fighter jets and Apache helicopters arrived overhead.Only later would the troops learn that the battalion responsible for the area believed that 150 Taliban fighters were near the village where the soldiers were resting when they came under fire. My words can t take away what people have been through,  Sergeant Bergdahl told the court on Monday.  Offering condolences is not enough. People went through things they shouldn t have had to go through. I grieve for those who have suffered and their families. For entire story: NYT s ",0.0
"FBI POSTS $5,000 REWARD For Person Who Committed Hate Crime With Bacon? [VIDEO]","Americans were warned by Attorney General, Loretta Lynch to not offend Muslims or they would pay a heavy price. Did anyone think she, or her boss were kidding? Barack Obama offends Christian Americans on a regular basis when will the FBI place a bounty on his head? The FBI is offering a $5,000 reward for information that helps them find the person who put raw bacon on the door handles of a Las Vegas mosque.The FBI said in a statement Wednesday that agents are trying to find the man seen in a surveillance video putting the meat on the entrances of the Masjid-e-Tawheed mosque. Authorities call it a desecration of the Islamic worship center.The Quran, the holy book of Islam, prohibits Muslims from eating pork, and pigs have been used to taunt or offend Muslims.Both the FBI and Las Vegas police say they re investigating the case as a possible hate crime.Las Vegas police spokesman Larry Hadfield said the bacon was wrapped on the door knobs, and was also found on the ground and fences.Officials at the mosque couldn t immediately be reached for comment.The FBI said the incident happened about 3:15 a.m. Dec. 27. The culprit is described as a white man wearing a dark blue hat, jacket and black-framed glasses.

THIS COMPANY PUTS UP A BILLBOARD THAT FINALLY GETS #BlackLivesMatter RIGHT WITHOUT THE RACIST CONNOTATION,"Black lives matter but only when white cops are responsible for their deaths. When blacks kill other blacks not so much.  Kudos to the Fred L. Davis Insurance Company for telling the truth about who s really doing the killing in black communities.That s the statement on a billboard in Memphis, Tennessee. However, there s more to it.The full message reads:  Black lives matter. So let s quit killing each other.  It s a statement directed against black-on-black crime.Normally, liberals take umbrage at the idea that somebody might evaluate problems caused within the black community by other blacks because it doesn t suit the narrative. However, the author of this message has a background that will make it difficult for people to attack him like that.Fred Davis is a civil rights activist who reportedly marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He s also the man behind the message.  We re going to have to wake up,  Davis said.  We re going to have to say to ourselves that black lives matter, and we re going to have to refrain from killing each other out of our own frustration. I can speak, not from reading a book about the history, because I was a part of the history,  he said.  I think that gives me a license as an experienced observer to push and to advocate to the black community   let s stop it. Fred L. Davis is no stranger to controversy.

Singapore founder's grandson names lawyer in contempt case,"SINGAPORE/CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (Reuters) - A nephew of Singapore s prime minister said a contempt of court proceeding against him, stemming from comments he made about the country s legal system, was  meritless  and he had appointed a lawyer to represent him. The Singapore attorney-general s office started court proceedings in August against Li Shengwu over a Facebook post in which he said the Singapore government is  very litigious and has a pliant court system.  Li, who is a grandson of the city state s founding leader Lee Kuan Yew, said at the weekend he had retained Singapore attorney Abraham Vergis, of the firm Providence Law Asia, to represent him.  It s sad that the Singapore government continues to press these meritless charges against me,  Li, a U.S.-based academic, told Reuters. Vergis, a veteran litigation lawyer, appeared at the Singapore High Court on Monday in a closed-door conference on the case. He said the case was likely to be a drawn out process and when asked how Li planned to proceed, Vergis told Reuters:  It is premature to be talking about that.  Lawyer Francis Ng, the senior state counsel from the attorney general s chambers, declined to comment. Singapore parliament last year passed a bill that made it punishable by up to three years in prison or a fine of up to S$100,000 (US$73,530) for anyone who alleges the country s judiciary is bias. Ng has previously described Li s Facebook post as  an egregious and baseless attack  on the Singapore legal system. On Aug. 4, Li said he did not mean to attack the Singapore judiciary and he had amended the  private  post to avoid misunderstanding, though he hasn t disclosed what changes he made. Li told Reuters in separate comments in an interview in August that he had left the country in July after friends expressed concerns he might be detained by the authorities. In the interview, Li did not identify the friends or specify the information they had. Reuters has no independent evidence that Li faced any threats to his safety.  In Singapore, it is possible that one can be detained and interrogated for some time without a lawyer,  Li said at the time. The case relates to a feud between Lee Kuan Yew s three children over the fate of Lee s house, which earlier this year gripped the nation not accustomed to such disputes erupting into public view. Lee Hsien Yang and sister Lee Wei Ling accused their elder brother, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, of abusing power to try to save the house as a historic monument in defiance of their father s wishes. The premier called a special sitting of parliament to  clear the air  over the issue and afterwards said the debate had failed to find any substantial evidence of abuse of power. Lee Kuan Yew, who died in 2015 at the age of 91, had lived in the house for most of his life. ",1.0
EPA inspector general to investigate agency chief's travels to Oklahoma,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The frequent travels of the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, to Oklahoma will be investigated following congressional requests, the agencys Office of Inspector General said on Monday. Pruitts many travels to his home state have fueled speculation that he intends to run for the U.S. Senate from Oklahoma. Administrator Pruitt is traveling the country to hear directly from the people impacted by EPAs regulations outside of the Washington bubble, said Amy Graham, an EPA spokeswoman. This is nothing more than a distraction from the Administrators significant environmental accomplishments. The Office of Inspector General said it would look into the frequency, cost and extent of Pruitts travels to Oklahoma through July 31, and whether travel policies and procedures were followed. It said the investigation will also aim to determine whether EPA policies and procedures are sufficiently designed to prevent fraud, waste and abuse with the Administrators travel that included trips to Oklahoma. Pruitt was in Oklahoma on at least 43 of the 92 days of March, April and May, according to copies of his travel records obtained by the Environmental Integrity Project watchdog group and reviewed by Reuters last month. The travel records show Pruitts schedule this spring often took him to cities in the U.S. heartland where he held meetings, often with oil and gas industry representatives, made speeches and attended events before flying to Tulsa for extended weekends. The records showed Pruitt paid for some legs of the trips directly related to his visits home, although it was not clear he paid for all such legs. Pruitt has riled environmentalists by raising doubts about climate change and by vowing to sweep away scores of Obama-era regulations to help business. Pruitt seems to be using these visits to launch his political career, said Melinda Pierce, legislative director for the Sierra Club, an environmental group that has been deeply critical of Pruitt. Perhaps he should use polluter money to fund these trips if hes going to continue doing their bidding. Before becoming head of the EPA under Republican President Donald Trump in February, he was Oklahomas attorney general and repeatedly sued the agency he now runs to block federal environmental rules.

Nigeria asks Britain for gear to fight Islamists: Johnson,"LAGOS (Reuters) - Britain is considering a request to sell military equipment to Nigeria to help it fight Boko Haram Islamist militants, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Thursday. British soldiers were already training Nigerian 28,000 troops confronting the militants in the northeast, Johnson told Reuters in the commercial capital Lagos.  They have put out a request for more help with materiel - equipment of one kind and another. We are going to look at that,  he said.   We will look at that very seriously on counter-IED provision, on a request for more help with attack helicopters, for instance. Let s have a look at what we can do,  he added, without going into further detail. Boko Haram militants have killed more than 20,000 people, forced around 2 million to flee and attacked Nigeria s neighbors in a campaign to carve out an Islamist caliphate.  Britain s Foreign Office was unable immediately to provide details of military sales to Nigeria in the last few years.  The Pentagon notified the U.S. Congress this month of the sale to Nigeria of 12 Super Tucano A-29 planes and weapons worth $593 million, to help it fight Boko Haram, .

"Kremlin says Putin, Erdogan discuss Syria in phone call","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan discussed an upcoming meeting of the Astana process on the Syrian conflict in the Kazakh capital in late October, the Kremlin said on Saturday. During their phone conversation, Putin and Erdogan talked about joint efforts within the Astana process, including the  creation of  de-escalation zones  in Syria, and further coordination towards resolving the Syria situation, the Kremlin said in a statement. The Astana talks are brokered by Russia, Turkey and Iran. In mid-September, the three countries agreed to post observers on the edge of a de-escalation zone in northern Syria s Idlib region largely controlled by Islamist militants. Putin and Erdogan also said the agreements reached between Russia and Turkey in Ankara in late September were being successfully implemented, particularly in trade and economic relations.  Overall, the conversation was business-like and constructive, directed at strengthening bilateral cooperation and interaction on the regional agenda,  the Kremlin said. The Russian-Turkish trade relationship has been affected by their dispute over supplies of Turkish tomatoes to Russia which Moscow is yet to fully restore. This dispute has been adding risks to Russian grain trade with Turkey. Russia, once the largest market for Turkish tomato producers, said this week it will allow purchases of 50,000 tonnes of Turkish tomatoes from only four Turkish producers from Dec. 1. The announcement came several days after Turkey, the second largest buyer of Russian wheat, said it had imposed a requirement for additional approval of Russian agriculture supplies by the Turkish authorities.

France's Macron says Raqqa fall not end of battle against Islamic State,"PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that France s military would continue its fight against lslamic State in Syria, but that the fall of the militant group s bastion in Raqqa needed to lead to an inclusive political system to restore stability.  The battle against Islamic State did not end with the fall of Raqqa and France will maintain its military effort as long as necessary,  Macron s office said in a statement.  The challenges of stabilization and reconstruction will not be less than those of the military campaign.  In a declaration formally announcing Raqqa s liberation from Islamic State after four months of battles, the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said on Friday that Raqqa would be part of a decentralized federal Syria.  France has supplied weapons to the SDF, has special forces operating in the region and has been one of core countries bombing militants as part of the U.S.-led coalition. The statement also said it was vital that governance in Raqqa respected all communities.  This principle should apply first and foremost to the city of Raqqa, under conditions that will enable the restoration of normal living conditions, the return of the displaced and refugee populations, and the sustainable return of peace and stability,  the statement said.  The fight against Islamic State has taken place amid a wider, multi-sided civil war between the government of President Bashar al-Assad, who is backed by Iran and Russia, and an array of rebel groups supported by other powers.  Syria must finally find a way out of the civil war, which has fueled terrorism since the suppression of the democratic movement by the Bashar al-Assad regime. A negotiated political transition is more necessary than ever,  the statement said. ",1.0
 Reporter Reveals The Real Reason Trump Fired Bannon From WH Post And Its Petty As Hell (VIDEO),"News that one of Trump s closest advisor, Steve Bannon, had been ousted from his position within the National Security Council, only further reinforced the disturbing amount of chaos happening within the White House. People are fired abruptly. People resign abruptly. And the reasons why are always obscured through a mountain of lies.In Bannon s case, the official White House line was that he had only been placed in his role to keep an eye on disgraced former national security advisor Michael Flynn.sr WH official tells me Bannon was only on NSC to keep an eye on Flynn & ""de-operationalize NSC from Rice"" & that he never went to a meeting  Rosie Gray (@RosieGray) April 5, 2017Unfortunately for Trump, the cover story was so hamfisted that it began falling apart almost immediately. In their rush to spin the story, top placed  anonymous sources  all began using the oddly specific word  de-operationalize  to describe Bannon s role suggesting this was a talking point being crafted from the White House itself. The excuse that Bannon was there to watch Michael Flynn is even worse. Trump has repeatedly stood by Flynn, so claiming he wanted Bannon to watch him means he knew Flynn was a crook but put him in the job anyways. Not a good look.What s the real reason Bannon was slapped down? A source close to Trump told White House correspondent John Roberts that Trump had grown increasingly jealous of Bannon sharing his  limelight. We are also told, though, that the president wasn t particularly happy with the way Bannon had been grabbing the limelight and that may have also played into all of this. The other, other shoe drops. @johnrobertsFox:  The president wasn t particularly happy at the way Bannon had been grabbing the limelight  pic.twitter.com/P3PIXNwL0n  Tom Namako (@TomNamako) April 5, 2017Which is kind of like life imitating art because for months people have been noting that the best (and perhaps only) way to stop severely unqualified Bannon from having influence in the White House would be to appeal to Trump s massive ego.Memo to all magazine editors: Put Bannon on the cover with big headlines referring to him as ""The Real President."" https://t.co/tMHXB5ZpVN  Jeet Heer (@HeerJeet) February 7, 2017And Politico reported in February that Trump was already furious that Bannon was getting some of the credit for his administration s actions. It s an issue that s been nagging at him for months.Hilariously, Saturday Night Live seized upon this unique opportunity to piss off Trump by referring to a grim reaper clothed Bannon as  President Bannon,  playing up the fact that Trump wasn t really in charge.Apparently, this childish play on Trump s narcissism actually worked. Trump would never go after Bannon because he s unqualified and overtly racist, or that he once described himself as Satan and Darth Vader. But Trump would certainly go after Bannon for getting too much attention. And he just did.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",0.0
"OBAMA STONEWALLING ON Why He Sent 13 Payments Of $99,999,999.99 To IranWhere Was Congress?","Leave it to the one and only Andrew McCarthy to put together a fantastic case against Obama and his lying administration when it comes to the latest race on the Treasury. This time it was a raid on a Treasury slush fund to give $1.3 billion to Iran. The Iran Deal is a great example of just how corrupt and dysfunctional our government is. Please take the time to read this incredible overview of the inner workings of giving billions to Iran It s UNREAL!The structured transfers of $1.3 billion from a Treasury slush fund remain shrouded in mystery.  Confidentiality ? Yes, that s the State Department s story on why the Obama administration is stonewalling the American people regarding the president s illegal and increasingly suspicious Iransom payoff. The administration refuses to divulge any further information about the $1.7 billion the president acknowledges paying the world s leading state sponsor of terrorism.Grilled on Wednesday about how Obama managed to pay the final $1.3 billion installment   particularly given the president s claim that it is not possible to send Tehran a check or wire-transfer   State Department spokesman Mark Toner decreed that the administration would continue  withholding this information  in order  to protect confidentiality. Whose confidentiality? The mullahs ? That of the intermediaries the president used? Whose privacy takes precedence over our right to know how Obama funneled our money to our enemies?The closest thing to an answer we have to the latest round of questions comes courtesy of the perseverance of the investigative journalist Claudia Rosett. (You weren t expecting the Republican Congress to be minding the purse, were you?) Recall that we have been asking about the $1.3 billion payment since the first revelations about this sordid affair. After all, if, as Obama and his toadies maintain, the payment is totally on the up and up   just a routine legal settlement involving Iran s own money   then why won t they answer basic questions about it? Why are such matters as the administration s process in tapping a congressionally appropriated funding source for the settlement   a settlement Congress did not approve and seems to be in the dark about paying for   being treated as if they were state secrets so sensitive you d need have a Clinton.mail account (or be a Russian hacker of a Clinton.mail account) to see them?Generally speaking, the State, Treasury, and Justice Departments cannot issue press releases fast enough to salute themselves over legal settlements that supposedly benefit taxpayers by billions of dollars   at least according to the same math that brought you all those Obamacare savings. How is it that, in what is purportedly a completely aboveboard legal case, we are not permitted to know how our own money was transferred to the jihadist plaintiff?With the administration taking the Fifth, it was left to Claudia to crawl through Leviathan s catacombs. In her New York Sun report on Monday, we learned that she hit pay dirt: stumbling upon a bizarre string of 13 identical money transfers of $99,999,999.99 each   yes, all of them one cent less than $100 million   paid out of an obscure Treasury Department stash known as the  Judgment Fund.  The transfers were made   to whom, it is not said   on January 19, just two days after the administration announced it had reached the $1.7 billion settlement with Iran. They aggregate to just 13 cents shy of $1.3 billion, the same amount the State Department claims Iran was owed in  interest  from the $400 million that our government had been holding since the shah deposited it in a failed arms deal just prior to the Khomeini revolution. So, stacked atop of the pallets of $400 million in foreign cash that Obama arranged to shuttle from Geneva to Tehran as ransom (or, as the administration prefers,  leverage ) for the release of American hostages   via an unmarked cargo plane belonging to Iran Air, a terrorist arm of the mullahs  terrorist coordinator, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps   we now have a second whopping money transfer that (a) violates federal criminal laws against providing things of value to Iran and (b) looks like it was conceived by Nicky Barnes.Read more: NRO",0.0
"TORONTO IMAM WANTS MUSLIMS To Only Do Business With Muslims, Work Together To Implement Sharia Law","We hear so much talk from the Left about working to help foreigners  assimilate. Yet here we have a prominent Imam calling for the segregation of Muslims from their host nation. How is this okay? Shaykh Said Rageah (     ) was born in Somalia and in the late 80s and moved to North America. Rageah has a Bachelor s in Islamic studies and a Masters in Shari ah and he has had several posts over the years, including: founder of Masjid Huda in Montreal and Masjid Aya in Maryland, advisor for Muslim Youth magazine, and member in the Aqsa Association.He is also the founder of both Muslim Magazine and Al Aqsa Association, and served as the Chaplain at both the University of Calgary and the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT). He served as an Imam at the Abu Hurairah Mosque in Toronto, the Chairman for the Journey of Faith Conference and as an instructor for the AlMaghrib Institute.In a sermon delivered at Abu Hurairah Centre in Toronto (the video was uploaded to YouTube on February 8, 2009), Imam Rageah called on Canadian Muslims to unite and translate their demography into a political and economic power that is necessary to make the government allow Muslims to implement the Islamic Law (Sharia) in their communities and to change the foreign policy.Rageah spoke in favour of following the example of the Sikh neighbourhood in Edmonton, Alberta, by bringing the Muslim community to live together in one area in which the authorities will not be able to make any decision without the approval of the Muslims.He urges Muslims to hire only Muslim workers, to buy products or services only from Muslim-owned businesses and to avoid advertising with media outlets owned by kafir, meaning unbeliever or infidel. In this way, he maintained, Canadian Muslims can strengthen themselves and live according to Islam.The following is a transcript of segments from Rageah s sermon:  With four, five [hundred] thousand Muslims you can create the most powerful lobby in Canada  with that number of Muslims you can create one of the strongest Muslim business in Toronto   If you just put our resources, if we put our resources together, if we can work together as an Ummah [Muslim nation] we can change a lot As Muslims, we are scattered all over the city. You have people living in Brampton, you have people living in Mississauga, you have people living in Whitby, you have people living in Richmond Hill. Imagine if we all get together in one area. In the City of Edmonton, the Sikh, Sikh, they live in one neighbourhood and nothing can be changed or done without their approval. We here we may as well benefit from the system that they have here. What can you do with unity? A lot. You can change a lot. You can change the foreign policy of this country. You can change how the Muslims think. You can even when need help, when you need help you call Muslim for your need you will help the Muslim community Brothers in the masjid [Mosque] right now, they are coming up with the magazine or newspaper called Ummah Times. What Ummah Times is that? Ummah Times is advertising all your businesses all the Muslim businesses [are] Ummah.  All you need to do   I will never advertise with a kafir [unbeliever, infidel], there you go. I hear some advertisements giving to 680 News $5,000. Before your Muslim brothers $50 and $80 or $100 we think twice before we do it. Unless we work together, the day we need a truck driver we know where to find truck drivers. The day that I need a cab I should have a number of a Muslim cab it s ok, pick me up. When I wan to see a doctor, only Muslim doctor. When I want to hire someone only Muslim worker. Then we can strengthen ourselves. This is the way and this is the only way we can exist in the society, living according to Islam. When the Sharia [Islamic Law], when the government of Toronto, Ontario gave us a break and said: deal your internal affairs based on your Sharia [Islamic Law] we did not go and say: Those few people are Ismailis and Ahmadis, they are not even Muslims. Why would they speak on behalf of Muslims. But, we say no, we keep quiet and see and watch what happens, and then the result was that they said  we will never allow you to rule yourselves, your internal affairs based on the Shariah My brothers in faith [     ], anything that happens in your Muslim community, in the City of Toronto, anything that can be done, five hundred thousand Muslims that is a great number, large number, you can do a lot, work together. Let s be an Ummah [nation] Take your children to Islamic schools. Take your vehicle to Muslim owned business. If you buy a vehicle make sure there is a Muslim business or car dealer that sells cars. If you want to do anything just ask if that individual is a Muslim or not. If he is not, then look for a Muslim, because I m sure you ll find a Muslim. I m sure you ll find a Muslim in that field    O Allah, Raise the standing of Islam and the Muslims [       ], and humiliate the infidels and the polytheists.  [     ]Via: Creeping Sharia",0.0
 Letter To The Editor Claims Hillary Is Unfit Because She Might Get Her Period (IMAGE),"A Pennsylvania man apparently failed basic biology, but he s a strong Donald Trump supporter. Carl Unger of Montgomery Pennsylvania wrote a letter to the Williamsport Sun-Gazette. The letter was supportive of Trump, but in protesting being called sexist, he makes one of the most sexist, and stupid attacks on Hillary Clinton yet. Now the liberals and Obama are calling for social justice and it is just code for socialism,  the letter begins. Now they have college students who are talking about being triggered and taking away freedom of speech while the liberal politicians work on taking our guns so we cannot defend ourselves when the government comes.  I hate to break it to you, Carl, but the government is everywhere. The government is the military, it s the police. If they wanted your guns, they would take them. They don t want them. They call us sexist just because we are critical of Hillary Clinton and her health.  Critical of her health? Do you expect her to apologize for the apparent federal offense of getting pneumonia?Read this next sentence/paragraph twice.Gee, Carl, we totally believe you aren t sexist, especially after that zinger. Women get sick and have their time of the month all the friggen time. Most of us still go about our business, because we have no other choice. As for Clinton, though, um, she s 68 years old. She probably hasn t had her time of the month since the last millennia. The last time, she likely lived in the White House. If she is still getting her period, well, we should be in complete awe.In case Carl s sexist argument for why he s not sexist hasn t convinced you, he also made a racist argument for why he s not racist.

Bone fragments found in Mexico to be tested for DNA links,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican authorities said on Tuesday they will aim to identify some 3,000 bone fragments, apparently human, found at the weekend in the northern state of Coahuila, where organized crime has been blamed for the loss of thousands of lives.  State prosecutors said they were sending the remains to a genetic laboratory to assess whether they could be linked to people who have disappeared. According to government data, nearly 18,600 people have disappeared since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. In November, he signed into law a national commission dedicated to finding people who have disappeared. It will add some 469 million pesos ($25 million) to fund search efforts in its first stage. Gang violence has claimed more than 100,000 lives over the past decade and authorities are often unable to identify bodies found in mass graves. VIDA, a Coahuila-based group representing 77 people whose relatives have gone missing, found the fragments in a field on Saturday after a tip-off about the location. The group, accompanied by prosecutors, experts and members of the military, also found a metal barrel, gun casings, two buttons and a buckle. VIDA spokeswoman Silvia Ortiz said similar previous discoveries indicated that victims  bodies had been dismembered and burned for hours before the bones were broken apart with shovels. State prosecutors said they could not yet determine how many people the bones belonged to, according to a spokesman. ",1.0
BREAKING EXCLUSIVE: BLACK REPUBLICAN Fired From Radio Station After Spending Time With Trump In Detroit,"For just a little over four months, Wayne Bradley could be heard spreading the conservative message on Detroit s 910AM Superstation. Then GOP nominee Donald Trump came to town, and things changed drastically.We ve known soft-spoken conservative, Wayne Bradley for several years. He s never been afraid of controversy and has always stood up for his conservative beliefs.On Friday, Bradley told us in an exclusive interview that local media had reached out to him when Trump came due to his position as State Director of African American Engagement for the Republican National Committee. Bradley   who was unpaid during his time at the station   didn t mention his affiliation with 910AM, which, he said, he generally doesn t do when discussing political issues with the media.He also met Trump and posted a photo of him with the candidate. When asked, Bradley said he had nothing to do with Trump s visit and was at at the rally with a pastor.The station, which was well aware of his work with the GOP, informed him by email that he was on  hiatus  that Friday, leading him to believe he would be back on the air shortly. But that wasn t the case.He received clarification on Monday that the show was canceled   for good.It s not clear why station management decided to cancel the show.A station representative told 100 Percent FED UP,  It was a business decision on the back-end. We contacted 910AM and spoke to an administrative assistant who refused to provide her name. According to the person we spoke to, no one at the station was available for comment because they were,  very, very  busy with meetings about Bradley s dismissal.The unnamed assistant told us that a statement would be released, but she was unsure when that might happen.But that s not what station owner Kevin Adell told the Detroit News. According to that report, Bradley was allegedly fired  for violating corporate policy. He violated corporate policy, that s why he got fired. He was let go for insubordination.  But it s not clear what policy Bradley allegedly violated. Bradley suggested it may have been due to the fact he didn t plug the station during interviews with the press.Regardless of the reason, Bradley said he appreciated the opportunity to have a dialogue with the community and was very grateful to have the air time.Moreover, he said that he understands the left-wing political climate in Detroit and respects the owner s decision.While he respects the decision, he told us he was  disappointed  with management for  silencing the dialogue. Others weren t happy with the decision and made their feelings known on the station s Facebook page. 910AM where blacks are kept on the Gov ment PLANTATION and other views of them PROSPERING on their own merits is not allowed,  one person said. Your way or the hiway-not the station I want to listen to-I m out!!!  another person added. I would like to know where Wayne Bradley is at? Why is he not on the air? Shameless,  commented a third critic.Bradley, who has been in radio off and on for about six years, says he s not worried and knows that something better will come along.And, he added, he appreciates the support of the listeners who reached out to the station.Meanwhile, the Oakland County Republican Party has offered their support for Wayne Bradley and asked fellow Republicans to call Superstation 910AM at:Station Phone: (248) 278-0910 Fax: (248) 350-3422 Studio Phone: (313) 209-9000Attention: Kevin Adell, Owner of 910 AM Dody Johnson, Station ManagerIn the meantime, Bradley said he ll continue his daily outreach efforts   something he s been doing since September 2013.

The shooting occurred just as the city hit the one-year anniversary of demonstrations after the killing of Freddie Gray and concerns about police brutality and training swept the country.A 13-year-old boy was shot by a police officer in Baltimore on Wednesday, after the officer saw what he believed to be a semi-automatic handgun, officials said.What officers thought was a handgun ultimately proved to be a replica BB gun, Baltimore Police Commissioner Kevin Davis told reporters.The boy was expected to survive his injuries, Davis said. My thoughts and prayers are with him,  Davis said.  My thoughts and prayers are with his family. Baltimore Police later released this photo of the BB gun:Police also took in the boy s mother, and video footage was released of that:.@namenzie Correction: Boy shot by cops is not dead.

It is a message that echoes several similar statements issued by police departments seeking to defend their own, only to have supplementary video footage or testimony contradict the claims of officers on the ground.Recently the family of 12-year-old Tamir Rice entered into a legal settlement with the city of Cleveland after the child was shot and killed while holding a toy gun. In that case, police claimed the boy was reaching into his waistband, which prompted the lethal shooting. Surveillance footage proved this was inaccurate, but the officer involved, Timothy Loehmann, was not indicted.Featured image via Facebook",0.0
 Trump Official Accidentally Leaks Plan To Steal Land From Mexico For Border Wall,"Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto may not be too happy once he hears of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke s plan to make that border wall thing happen. You see, the terrain on our southern border isn t exactly the most uniform thing in the universe and at times there may be complications   like the Rio Grande River.E&E News reports that Zinke told a crowd at an event held by Public Lands Council this week that the Trump administration didn t want to build the wall on American soil because it would mean handing the entire Rio Grande river to Mexico   so he just wants to take the land instead: The border is complicated, as far as building a physical wall. The Rio Grande, what side of the river are you going to put the wall? We re not going to put it on our side and cede the river to Mexico. And we re probably not going to put it in the middle of the river. Zinke stopped just shy of saying that we d take the land by force, but he made it pretty clear that the United States isn t going to give up the river   and Mexico isn t going to hand over land on their side to build a gigantic ugly wall on the border. First, President Trump proposed building a wall on our southern border and having Mexico pay for it. Now his administration is planning to build a wall in Mexico and have Americans pay for it,  Austin Evers, executive director of watchdog group Americans Oversight, said in a statement following the remarks.Will Trump s agenda lead us to war with one of our allies? If the administration has its way, according to Zinke, that s exactly what will happen.featured image via screengrab",0.0
Venezuela ex-prosecutor says she has evidence of Maduro corruption,"BRASILIA/CARACAS (Reuters) - Dismissed Venezuelan prosecutor Luisa Ortega said on Wednesday she had evidence that President Nicolas Maduro was involved in corruption with construction company Odebrecht. Ortega, 59, was a key player in Venezuela s government but broke with it in March. She fled last week to Colombia by boat and on Wednesday morning landed in Brazil. Ortega said she had been persecuted in an effort to hide details of high-level corruption, saying she had proof, though she offered none. Ortega linked the Odebrecht scandal with Maduro and Socialist Party heavyweights including Diosdado Cabello and Jorge Rodriguez. Ortega said she had evidence that Cabello received some $100 million from the Brazilian company.  The international community must investigate such cases,  she told a news conference. Venezuelan authorities did not respond to a request for comment. Odebrecht admitted in a settlement with U.S. and Brazilian prosecutors to paying bribes across 12 countries to win contracts. According to a U.S. court ruling, between 2001 and 2016, Odebrecht paid about $788 million in bribes in countries including Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela. Ortega was removed from her position early this month by Venezuela s newly formed constituent assembly, a controversial pro-government body whose installation was called dictatorial by governments worldwide. Maduro said on Tuesday he would seek Ortega s arrest, accusing her of having worked for some time with the United States. Maduro blames Washington for many of Venezuela s problems, including triple-digit inflation, shortages of basic goods and months of anti-government unrest. In Caracas, state-controlled television broadcast images on Wednesday of a police operation in what it said was Ortega s apartment. The cameras showed marble floors, large paintings of Ortega herself and one by Andy Warhol, a cellar containing an array of expensive wines and a wardrobe filled with designer labels. Ortega said she would give details of the corruption cases to authorities in the United States, Spain, Mexico, Brazil and Colombia. Since settling in the United States, Brazil and Switzerland for a record $3.5 billion, Odebrecht has sought to negotiate leniency deals that would allow it to keep operating in other countries across Latin America.

Henningsen: US Anti-Trump Protests Similar to Soros Color Revolutions Abroad,"21st Century Wire says Organized efforts are underway by Democratic Party affiliated NGO s to try and somehow delegitimize the results of this week s US Presidential Election. On the eve of the US Election before voters went to the polls, 21WIRE political affairs analyst Patrick Henningsen accurately predicted this week s unrest when he said: If Trump wins, expect the likes of Soros and MoveOn.org to unleash wave after wave of flash mobs, who will protest, riot, smash and burn their way on to CNN s 24 hour news rotation. Expect Occupy 2.0, and #BlackLivesMatter to rage. On Friday, Henningsen talked to RT International about the post-elections protests that were coordinated in part by Democratic Party  community organizing  online platform MoveOn.org. Watch: SEE ALSO: (VIDEO) Female College Students Protesting Because  Trump is a Rapist 21WIRE Associate Editor Shawn Helton recently revealed more details about how the near exact same methods used in CIA and Soros-funded  color revolutions  overseas   are now being deployed on US domestic shores by similar NGO front organizations:  has been the driving force behind nationwide protests against the election of Donald Trump. Overseas, Washington tends to use the same cast of NGO fronts to build-up pro-US political opposition groups, as well as plan and generate civil unrest. They include the Albert Einstein Institute (AEI), National Endowment for Democracy (NED), International Republican Institute (IRI), National Democratic Institute (NDI), Freedom House and later the International Center for Non-Violent Conflict (ICNC), and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the financial and contractor arm of the Department of State. Inside the US, deep state actors in Washington generally work through Democratic Party affiliated organizations like MoveOn.org, as well as through labor union organizations like AFL-CIO, and UNITE HERE. These, along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this week s protests,  says Helton. Helton also raised the question as to why President Obama has stayed silent in the face of street protests, opting instead to  lead from behind.  He explains: Certainly, judging by President Obama and Hillary Clinton s total silence over their own party s role in fomenting this week s unrest   one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots. The political motivation is undeniable   to help delegitimize a new Trump presidency.

China newspapers say call with Taiwan's Tsai shows Trump's inexperience,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese state media on Monday continued to play down the protocol-bending phone call last week between U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Taiwans president, with editorials in two newspapers saying the move showed Trumps inexperience. Chinas national English-language newspaper, the China Daily, said the 10-minute call exposed nothing but the inexperience Trump and his transition team have in dealing with foreign affairs. The action was due to a lack of a proper understanding of the sensitive issues in Sino-U.S. relations and cross-Strait ties, it said. The Friday call was the first by a U.S. president-elect or president since President Jimmy Carter switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, acknowledging Taiwan as part of one China. Chinas Foreign Ministry said on Saturday it had lodged stern representations with what it called the relevant U.S. side, urging the careful handling of the Taiwan issue to avoid any unnecessary disturbances in ties. China considers Taiwan a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday pointedly blamed Taiwan for the exchange, rather than Trump, calling it a petty action. The China Daily said that for Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, the call achieves nothing substantial, only pride in making what is an illusionary groundbreaking move, and temporarily diverting public attention on the island away from her bad performance. It would be a mistake for Tsai and her party to over-interpret the significance of the call, it said. Her attempts to stir up tension... will ultimately backfire. The Global Times, a hawkish tabloid under the ruling Communist Partys top newspaper the Peoples Daily, called Trump bluffing and unpredictable, but said he did not have plans to overturn Americas international relationships. It seems that Trump is still taking advantage of his perceived fickleness and unpredictability to make some choppy waves in the Taiwan Straits to see if he can gain some bargaining chips before he is sworn in, it said. The Global Times added targeting him would be inappropriate since he is not yet president. He has zero diplomatic experience and is unaware of the repercussions of shaking up Sino-U.S. relations, it said. Instead, China could send a message to Trump by punishing Taiwan, wooing away one or two of the islands diplomatic allies or beefing up military deployments against Taiwan, it said. It is certain that Trump doesnt want a showdown with China, because it is not his ambition, and neither was it included in his promise to the electorate. He puts out feelers to sound China out and chalk up some petty benefits. On Monday, Taiwans Liberty Times, considered close to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, reported Tsai is planning to transit in New York early next month on her way to visit three diplomatic allies - Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador. The trip would take place before Trumps inauguration January 20 and Tsais delegation would seek to meet with Trumps team, including Reince Priebus, Trumps White House chief of staff, the report said.  Taiwans Presidential Office said media reports about a January trip were excessive speculation. It said it would announce any presidential trips at the appropriate time. ",1.0
U.S. appeals court rejects Trump's bid to bar most refugees,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Thursday rejected the Trump administrations effort to temporarily bar most refugees from entering the country, ruling that those who have relationships with a resettlement agency should be exempt from an executive order banning refugees.  A three-judge 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel also  ruled that grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins of legal U.S. residents should be exempted from President Donald Trumps order, which banned travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The ruling is the latest legal blow to the Presidents sweeping executive order barring travelers from Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days, which the Republican president said was necessary for national security. The Justices said that the government did not persuasively explain why the travel ban should be enforced against close relatives of people from the six countries or refugees with guarantees from resettlement agencies. The 3-0 ruling takes effect in five days. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that Trumps ban could be implemented on a limited basis, but should not be applied to people with bona fide relationships to people or entities in the United States.  The government took a narrow view of that interpretation, which the state of Hawaii challenged in court. A lower court judge sided with Hawaii, and the 9th Circuit judges upheld that view.  It is hard to see how a grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, sibling-in-law, or cousin can be considered to have no bona fide relationship with their relative in the United States, the court said.  The court also rejected the administrations argument that the written assurances provided by resettlement agencies obligating them to provide services for specific refugees is not a bona fide relationship.  The agencies advance preparation and expenditure of resources for each refugee supports the district courts determination that a bona fide relationship with the refugee exists, the decision said. Trumps first version of the executive order, signed in January, sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world before it was blocked by courts. The administration replaced that version of the ban with a new order in March in response to the legal challenges. A Department of Justice spokeswoman said: The Supreme Court has stepped in to correct these lower courts before, and we will now return to the Supreme Court to vindicate the Executive Branchs duty to protect the Nation. Hawaiis Attorney General Douglas Chin said the ruling keeps families together. It gives vetted refugees a second chance. The Trump administration keeps taking actions with no legal basis. We will keep fighting back. Refugee organizations cheered Thursdays decision, saying it will give relief to people fleeing violence who were caught in limbo after the ban. The broader question of whether the revised travel ban discriminates against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution will be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court in October. ",1.0
UPDATE: UNDER PRESSURE? MISS USA Just Flip Flopped On Healthcare [VIDEO],"The glowing review we gave to Miss USA Kara McCullough must be revoked Bummer!She was our hero when she defended liberty from the liberals who believe healthcare is not a right but a privilege.

She may have heard the word  privilege  and, in the stress of the moment, processed it not in the legal sense but in the colloquial sense, as a synonym for gratitude for one s good fortune. E.g., it s a privilege to be a citizen of the greatest country in the world, I m privileged to have a wonderfully supportive family, what a privilege to have good medical care through your job, etc. A pageant contestant wants to project graciousness, so that s what she did.Or maybe she was taken to the woodshed for an attitude adjustment, and came back a commie.Via: moonbattery",0.0
"China combat veteran, close ally of Xi, to get promotion: sources","BEIJING (Reuters) - A close ally of President Xi Jinping is expected to be promoted to vice chairman of China s Central Military Commission, four sources said, as Xi cements his control over the armed forces. Zhang Youxia, 67, one of just a few senior military officers with combat experience, is tipped to become one of at least two vice chairmen of the commission, the sources, including three with direct ties to the leadership, told Reuters. Xi is chairman of the commission, which has overall control of the People s Liberation Army, as well as the nation s president and general secretary of the Communist Party of China. Zhang would replace Fan Changlong, who is expected to retire during the 19th Communist Party Congress which begins on Wednesday. The other vice chairman, Xu Qiliang, is expected to stay on, the sources said. Both Xi and Zhang are from the northwestern province of Shaanxi and both are children of former senior officials who fought together in the civil war in the 1940s. China s Defence Ministry did not respond to a faxed request for comment. The party has been studying a proposal to increase the number of vice chairmen on the military commission from two to four and reduce the number of other committee members, currently eight, some of the sources said. Xi has shaken up the commission and military since assuming power late in 2012 as he roots out corruption and streamlines the 2 million-strong armed forces, the world s largest. Some 300,000 troops have been laid off and advanced new equipment such as stealth fighters has been developed. While China has not fought a war in decades, it is taking an increasingly assertive line in the disputed East China Sea and South China Sea, as well as over self-ruled Taiwan, which is claimed by China. Two outgoing members of the commission are currently under investigation for suspected graft, sources have told Reuters, though the government has yet to confirm this.  It isn t the first time the military has faced corruption issues. A previous vice chairman, Guo Boxiong, was jailed for life for graft last year, while another former vice chairman, Xu Caihou, died of cancer in 2015 before he could face trial over alleged corruption. Zhang is currently the eighth-ranked member of the 11-man military commission. Zhang is also expected to be promoted to the Communist Party s 25-member Politburo, one of its elite ruling bodies, three of the sources said. One source with ties to the leadership said that the fathers of Xi and Zhang - Xi Zhongxun and Zhang Zongxun - had been close.  The two fathers fought together in the civil war that ended in 1949 with the Communist victory and proclamation of the People s Republic of China. Both men rose to senior positions in the government and military.  The second generation of the two families are also close,  the source added, referring to Xi and Zhang. Born in Beijing, Zhang Youxia joined the army in 1968, rising through the ranks and joining the military commission in late 2012.  He fought against Vietnam in a brief border war in 1979 that China launched in punishment for Vietnam invading Cambodia the previous year and ousting the Beijing-backed Khmer Rouge. Zhang was 26 when he was sent to the frontlines to fight the Vietnamese, where he performed well and was quickly promoted, according to state media. He also fought in another border clash with Vietnam in 1984.  During the battle, whether attacking or defending, Zhang Youxia performed excellently,  the official China Youth Daily wrote in August in a piece entitled,  These Chinese generals have killed the enemy on the battlefield . Another officer recently promoted, Li Zuocheng, who was named chief of the Joint Staff Department of the People s Liberation Army in August, also fought in the 1979 war. Li is also likely to become one of the commission s vice chairmen, but it was unclear if he will also join the Politburo, the sources said. One of the sources, who has ties to the military, said Zhang had a reputation when he was based in northeastern China of walking around his base dressed in civilian clothes, prompting challenges from junior soldiers who didn t recognize him.  He doesn t put on airs and likes getting down in the dirt with ordinary soldiers, to know what their lives are like, how they are living and what they are eating,  said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

The ISLAMIC RAPE OF EUROPEOne Nation Is Fighting Back In Most Politically Incorrect Way,"As an American of Polish descent, I am proud to see Poland taking a stand against an invasion of Muslims who seek to forever change the culture and destroy the rich history European nations have enjoyed for centuries. While other European nations sit back and wring their hands over the rape, sodomy and molestation of their citizens, Poland is taking a strong stand by letting the Muslim migrants know, they are not welcome to invade their country.One of Poland s most popular weekly magazines has splashed a graphic depiction of the rape of Europe s women by migrants on its front cover. The image may be one of the most politically incorrect illustrations of the migrant crisis to date.While Poland is generally much more relaxed about expressing itself than the self censoring tendencies of western and northern Europe, the cover of the latest wSieci (The Network) conservative magazine has already prompted reaction just 24 hours after release, being beamed around the continent by social media.Featuring a personification of Europa being pawed at by dark hands   what the German media would perhaps euphemistically term  southern  or  Mediterranean    the headline decries the  Islamic Rape of Europe .Making perfectly clear the intention of the edition, the edition features articles titled  Does Europe Want to Commit Suicide?  and  The Hell of Europe . The news-stand blurb declares:  In the new issue of the weekly Network, a report about what the media and Brussels elite are hiding from the citizens of the European Union .Opening the cover article, Aleksandra Rybinska writes:  The people of old Europe after the events of New Year s Eve in Cologne painfully realised the problems arising from the massive influx of immigrants. The first signs that things were going wrong, however, were there a lot earlier. They were still ignored or were minimised in significance in the name of tolerance and political correctness .Outlining the fundamental differences between eastern Islam and western Christianity    culture, architecture, music, gastronomy, dress    the editorial explains these two worlds have been at war  over the last 14 centuries  and the world is now witnessing a colossal  clash of two civilisations in the countries of old Europe . This clash is brought by Muslims who come to Europe and  carry conflict with the Western world as part of the collective consciousness , as the journalist marks the inevitability of conflict between native Europeans and their new guests.The collapse of the West in the face of this  Islamic rape  was not inevitable though, as Rybinska quoted British historian Arnold Toynbee:  Civilisations die from suicide, not by murder .Via: Breitbart News",0.0
Obama sets state dinner table for six at unusual Nordic summit,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama is set to toast the five leaders of Nordic nations at a lavish state dinner at the White House on Friday, an unusual summit aimed in part at sending a message to a nation not on the guest list: Russia. Obama will laud the humanitarian and environmental accomplishments of Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Iceland, but also wants to talk about how to deal with their increasingly aggressive neighbor Russia ahead of a NATO summit in July. We share the concern of countries in the region, particularly those who have a border with Russia, about the increasing presence of Russian military assets in the area, said Charles Kupchan, Obamas senior director for European affairs. We will be discussing ways to enhance the security of the region, writ large, and also what we can do through dialogue and diplomacy to urge Russia to be more transparent and to be more restrained and careful in its military exercises, Kupchan told reporters. Obama last met Nordic leaders in Stockholm in 2013 on his way to a G20 summit in St. Petersburg after canceling a planned bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin because of tensions over Syria and surveillance issues. Since then, Russia annexed Ukraines Crimea region, prompting Nordic nations to step up their military cooperation and the United States to boost military spending to help NATO do more to try to deter Russia. During a recent visit to Europe, Obama sought to reassure allies about the U.S. commitment to the continent, but pushed nations to increase their defense spending and stay united amid the strain of dealing with an influx of migrants fleeing Middle East conflicts. The leaders will discuss a long-term approach for dealing with refugees, Kupchan said, as well as new contributions to the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq. He declined comment on specific commitments from the meeting. Typically, the White House rolls out the red carpet for one leader at a time. Friday will be a bit trickier, juggling five guests of honor and their entourages. The state dinner itself will be in a large tent with a transparent ceiling evoking the northern lights and shadowy spaces in the arctic night, the White House told reporters. Guests will sit at long, rustic wooden tables bedecked with columns of ice, fiddlehead ferns, and fragrant hand-rolled beeswax candles, and dine on braised Nebraska beef short ribs and salt-cured Atlantic ahi tuna served in a large ice cube.  The summit is expected to be heavy on feel-good messages about the outsized role Nordic nations play in international diplomacy, said Julie Smith, a former Obama administration official now with the Center for a New American Security. In many ways, the actual visit is the deliverable, Smith said, noting it was unlikely major new initiatives would emerge. Were at the end of the presidents tenure so there are limits on what new things he can drive forward, Smith said. In Washington, preparations for the leaders arrival have been overshadowed by a visit by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to meet with congressional leaders as the race intensifies to replace Obama in the White House in the Nov. 8 election. Trump has said NATO is obsolete and European nations should look after their own defense, which has sparked concern among Nordic nations, said Heather Conley, a former State Department official in the George W. Bush administration. They hear with great clarity the statements of Donald Trump and they dont know exactly how this is going to work in November, said Conley, now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Norways Prime Minister Erna Solberg plans to stress the importance of American participation in NATO for Nordic nations, she said in an interview this week with the Norwegian daily Aftenposten. With an unpredictable Russian presence in the northern areas, its important that the Americans have a focus on the Arctic regions, Solberg said. ",1.0
 Germanys President Joins Chancellor Merkel In Sharp Criticism Of Irritating Trump,"Unlike the United States, Germany has both a President and a Chancellor. The President is nothing more than a figurehead, of course; it is Chancellor Angela Merkel actually runs the nation. At any rate, Germany s current President, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, has come out on television to tell everyone just how he feels about Donald Trump.Speaking to a German television host, President Steinmeier says that he is  irritated  by Trump. Of course, since Germany is a staunch ally of the United States, he was careful in his wording and quick to recognize the relationship between the two nations, especially during the crucial rebuilding of Europe in the post World War II era. Steinmerier says: Our economic development would not have happened without the Marshall Plan. In this respect, I advise us not to throw everything overboard, even though I admit that I am irritated about a lot of things. He went on to essentially say he knows that most Americans are just as horrified by Trump as he is: Not all of America has forgotten the transatlantic relationship, and therefore I believe that within American politics, there will be corrections made to what we are now seeing. Of course, this is how you rebuke someone without even mentioning their name. Further, these remarks should come as no surprise, since Trump and German Chanecellor Angela Merkel have long had a frosty relationship. Like decent people everywhere, she was appalled by Trump s campaign trail behavior, and things have only gotten worse since Trump took office. When Merkel visited the White House, Trump actually gave her a bill for NATO, apparently in an attempt to keep his promise that he d make our allies pay up before offering  our protection. He also had the audacity to joke about Merkel being wiretapped. And then of course, there was the fact that Trump was way out of his league at the G 20, the G 7 and NATO Summits.All in all, the world cannot wait to be rid of Trump. It s okay   neither can we.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",0.0
 Paul Ryan Refuses To Hold Town Halls Because Hes Too Afraid Of Protesters,"House Speaker Paul Ryan finally admitted the reason he is refusing to hold town hall meetings: He s too afraid of protesters. Speaking at a Boy Scouts event in Wisconsin, Ryan told the crowd that he just doesn t have the guts to face his own constituents when he knows they are p*ssed that he s trying to steal their health care. Aside from the obvious security concerns, what we have found is there are people who are trying to come in from out of the district to disrupt town hall meetings and not have a civil discussion, so what I have been doing is looking for new and creative ways to interact with my constituents in a civil way,  Ryan said. That s why I have done a number of telephone town hall meetings, which I find very effective as people don t have to travel. I do office hours. I just did them this morning in Janesville. In addition, I am doing a lot of business ones,  the Speaker said.Ryan said that he has found other ways to meet with his constituents, like the town-hall style meeting he held on Thursday that was closed to the public with only 25 employees of the business he was touring in attendance. I find when you guys are there, people kind of clam up. They get a little nervous, but when you do business town halls without media it is very interactive, so I am finding a lot of different ways to have a good civil dialogue with constituents,  he continued.Ryan then said that if people want to talk to him, that s what his office hours are for, which he explained help keep him safe from all those big, mean protesters. Additionally, if you want to come do office hours, they schedule office hours because I don t want to have a situation where we just have a screaming fest, a shouting fest where people are being bussed in from out of the district to get on TV because they are yelling at somebody. That does nobody any good, and what I want to do is have a civil, good conversation with constituents, and that s why I do all these different things, whether it s planned tours, telephone town halls, office hours and the rest,  he said.So, that s Ryan s master plan to deal with the ever increasing public anger over his plan to take health care from millions. He s just going to hide like the spineless coward that he is. Sounds legit.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",0.0

 Trump Campaign Manager Registering As Foreign Agent After Lobbying For Russian Interests,"Donald Trump s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, is now retroactively registering as a foreign agent   the new term for  traitor,  apparently   after the water got a bit too hot with regard to his lobbying efforts on behalf of a pro-Putin Ukranian party.BREAKING: Spokesman says former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort is registering with US gov't as foreign agent.

I think theres been a lot of flexibility in terms of some of my contacts in conservatives in terms of not making it totally offset ..., Meadows said in an interview on ABCs This Week with George Stephanopoulos. A fiscal conservative, Meadows had said that tax reform depended on the repeal of Obamacare in order to offset the likely cost of tax cuts.  President Donald Trump has already said he will move on from dealing with healthcare to his tax plans and in a tweet on Sunday morning blamed the Freedom Caucus for keeping Obamacare intact. Democrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of Club For Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood & Ocare! he tweeted. Meadows, whose group was pivotal in sinking the Republican plan to repeal Obamacare in the House, said he had not yet given up on efforts to reform healthcare before tackling tax reform. I still believe that there is a good chance, if moderates and conservatives can come together, that we repeal and replace Obamacare, bring premiums down, cover more people, he said. ",1.0

Turkey's Erdogan says may shut Iraqi border any moment: Hurriyet,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey may shut its border with northern Iraq  at any moment  after closing its air space to the region, Hurriyet newspaper reported on Thursday, reviving a threat first made after Kurds there voted for independence.  We have completely closed our air space to the regional government in northern Iraq,  the paper cited Erdogan as telling reporters on his plane returning from a trip to Poland.  Talks are continuing on what will be done regarding the land (border) ... We have not shut the border gates yet but this could happen too at any moment,  he added. Turkey announced on Monday it was closing its air space to the semi-autonomous Kurdish region and said it would work to hand control of the main border crossing into the region to the central Iraqi government. The Habur gate is the main transit point between Turkey and Iraq s semi-autonomous Kurdish Regional Government.  A Sept. 25 referendum, in which Kurds in northern Iraq voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence, alarmed Baghdad, Iraq s neighbors and Western powers, all of whom feared further regional conflict could arise from the vote. Subsequently Kurdish Peshmerga forces retreated to positions they held in northern Iraq in June 2014 in response to an Iraqi army advance into the region after the referendum, a senior Iraqi commander said on Wednesday. Ankara, which has been battling a three-decade insurgency in its own mainly Kurdish southeast, fears an independent Kurdish state on its borders would heighten separatist tension at home. ",1.0
U.S. lawmaker's controversial tweet on immigration draws fire,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Steve King on Monday stood by controversial remarks on immigration and birth rates, in which he said our civilization could not be restored with somebody elses babies, drawing condemnation from Democrats and fellow Republicans.  The speaker of the Republican-dominated House of Representatives, Paul Ryan, and the leading Democrat in the chamber, Nancy Pelosi, both took exception to Kings remarks.  The Iowa congressman on Sunday posted a tweet praising Geert Wilders, a nationalist, anti-Islam politician vying to become the Netherlands prime minister in a national election on Wednesday. Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We cant restore our civilization with somebody elses babies, King wrote in a post that drew thousands of likes. Pelosi on Monday called on House Republican leaders to condemn Kings comments, saying they must decide whether white supremacy is welcome in the GOP ranks. A spokeswoman for Ryan, AshLee Strong, said, The speaker clearly disagrees (with King) and believes Americas long history of inclusiveness is one of its great strengths.  King, an early supporter of Donald Trump in last years presidential election, defended his tweet in an interview on CNN on Monday. He pointed to Western Europe, where he said low birth rates were harming civilization, culture and values. Id like to see an America that is just so homogenous that we look a lot the same, he said. I think theres far too much focus on race, especially in the last eight years. I want to see that put behind us. Pressed on birth rates for different groups of Americans, King said: They contribute differently to our culture and civilization. Some of Kings House colleagues appeared to take his tweet personally. What exactly do you mean?, tweeted Republican U.S. Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida. Do I qualify as somebody elses baby? #concernedGOPcolleague. Democratic Representative Ted Lieu, who immigrated to the United States at age 3, tweeted a picture of his two sons, writing: Dear Representative Steve King: These are my two babies  Representative Ted Lieu. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush said, America is a nation of immigrants, and added that Kings sentiment doesnt reflect our shared history or values. Bush was one of Trumps Republican rivals for the White House. The tweet also drew fire from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. The head of the civil and human rights law firm, Sherilyn Ifill, said Kings remarks were an explicit call to return to the shameful period when white supremacy was the norm in American public life.  Ifill said Kings remarks were particularly dangerous at a time when violent hate crimes have reached dangerous levels. King is from a rural state where nearly 92 percent of the population is white, compared with 77 percent for the nation as a whole, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Jeff Kaufmann, head of the Republican Party in Iowa, said in a statement that he disagreed with King, also calling the United States a nation of immigrants and saying that such diversity was its strength.

"COLLEGE PROFESSORS SEVERED TRUMP HEAD Painting Displayed In Art Gallery At Largest PUBLIC University In Alaska: After Trump was elected, I spent days just weeping","A painting on display at a University of Alaska Anchorage art gallery, which depicts the severed head of President Donald Trump, is sparking debate about free speech rights and whether the image is appropriate for display, at a public institution.The artwork, created by Assistant Professor of Painting Thomas Chung, is part of a faculty art exhibition, at the UAA Fine Arts building.In describing his painting, Chung said,  It s an image of the actor who plays Captain America, and two eagles are sort of screaming into his ears, and he s holding the severed head of Trump, and there s a young Hillary Clinton clinging to his leg. I was reminded of those 80 s rock posters, where there s a woman in tattered clothes clinging to a strong male hero s leg. Chung says the motivation for the painting was his dismay over the results of the presidential election. After Trump was elected, I spent days just weeping. And it was really surprising, because I m not a political person,  Chung said.  I am a social artist. I deal mostly in ideals of culture and global culture, but this election bled into that. The painting has prompted debate on social media and complaints to the university.Paul Berger, a former adjunct professor at UAA, went to see the painting, after a family member saw it on display. Berger posted pictures of the painting on his Facebook page. The painting itself, I kind of found disturbing,  Berger said.  The image itself was very graphic. So from that point of view, and as a father, trying to explain to my children what the artist is trying to say   [it s] difficult. Berger said he supports free speech, but questions whether it is appropriate for display, at a publicly-funded institution. Had the roles been reversed, and it was Obama s head hanging there, I think the outrage would be fantastic,  Berger said.  As a free speech advocate, everyone has a right to express their opinion the way they want to express them. But as a parent and a citizen, there s a discussion. In a university setting, what s appropriate? Chung said he had reservations about putting his painting on display at UAA, because of its political message. I was really torn about putting this piece up a faculty show, because I would never talk about my own political beliefs to my students,  Chung said.  I would never push that upon them and make them feel uncomfortable, and so I wondered to myself if putting up this painting was in a way doing that. But I realized that I feel very strongly about this, and I think even students that might be pro-Trump supporters could benefit from having a conversation with me about why I feel this way   why I painted this. Berger, who describes himself as a political conservative, questions whether a painting, depicting the decapitation of the president, will help civil discourse about politics. Prior to the election, it was important to the opposing side that we accept, move forward, respect our president and respect the rule of law,  Berger said.  As we raise our kids in our schools, we try to teach them and inculcate them in our civics. Paintings like that   I really think   send a strong, powerful, wrong message to children and students. Steven Godfrey, chairman of the Fine Arts Department at UAA, said,  I guess the people are upset about the work that s being shown. If they were taking a class at the university and made art that was considered controversial, no matter what their political or religious bent is, we would do our best to protect them and protect their rights to make that kind of work in the institution, whether it would be a student or faculty. The exhibition that includes the painting is scheduled to remain on display through April 20, in the Kimora Gallery.  KTUUTom Chung was born in New Jersey and grew up in Hong Kong and New York City. He received his Bachelors of Fine Arts Degree from the San Francisco Art Institute in 2010 and his Masters of Fine Arts Degree from Yale University in 2013. He has participated in numerous group and solo shows throughout the United States. His multidisciplinary work has been written about in Art in America, The New Yorker, and Modern Painters Magazine.",0.0
DEMOCRAT CHAIRMAN YELLS All Together NowF*ck Donald Trump!Crowd Shoots Middle Finger At Stage [VIDEO],"AP reported:California s elected Democrats had tough words for President Donald Trump and the GOP Congress on Saturday, urging their party s fired-up activists to work against the 14 Republicans in the state s congressional delegation.The party s leaders blasted Trump s alleged ties to Russia and presented California as the epicenter of liberal resistance to the president. The world, literally the world, is counting on all of you, counting on California to reject Trump s deception and destructiveness,  said Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is among a crowded field of Democrats running for governor next year.U.S. Sen.

Democrats ask White House about Trump son-in-law's potential conflicts,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three Democratic lawmakers questioned the White House on Wednesday over its handling of U.S. President Donald Trumps son-in-laws potential conflicts of interest now that he is serving as an official adviser.  Jared Kushner, a real estate developer who advised Trump during the presidential campaign, was cleared by the U.S. Department of Justice in January to serve as a White House senior adviser. Kushner, who is married to Trumps eldest daughter, Ivanka, has been given a wide range of domestic and foreign policy responsibilities, including working on a Middle East peace deal. In a letter to Deputy White House Counsel Stefan Passantino, Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tom Carper expressed concern over media reports that Kushner is maintaining some business interests, and asked how the White House plans to comply with laws that prohibit federal officials from profiting by government work. Neither the White House nor Mr. Kushners attorneys, however, has confirmed which financial assets Mr. Kushner still controls, making oversight impossible, they wrote with U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings, the senior Democrat on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in the House of Representatives. They also said the White House, unlike previous administrations, is not posting ethics-pledge waivers on its websites, adding that the public should know the issues from which Kushner must recuse himself. The White House had no immediate comment on the letter. A lawyer for Kushner, Jamie Gorelick, said in a statement: Mr. Kushner is fully complying with the ethics rules, removing himself from active participation in his prior businesses, divesting of substantial assets and recusing himself where appropriate in light of interests that he is not divesting. Before Trump took office on Jan. 20, Gorelick said her client would leave his familys company, divest substantial assets and recuse himself from matters that could affect his financial interests, Bloomberg reported.  Public interest journalism site ProPublica, citing documents submitted to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, reported in February that Kushner had divested some assets but was keeping other holdings linked to privately held Kushner Companies.     In authorizing Kushners appointment, the Justice Department  ruled that Trump, as president, has special hiring authority that exempts White House positions from laws barring the president from naming a relative to lead a federal agency.  The Democratic lawmakers called on the White House for details on what holdings Kushner maintains, a list of issues he will recuse himself from, and copies of any ethics waivers. They also raised questions about holdings belonging to his wife, who established a clothing and jewelry line, and whether that would lead Kushner to recuse himself from any issues. Trump himself has said he would maintain ownership of his global business empire but would hand off control to his two oldest sons while president.   ",1.0
Mylan offers discounts on EpiPen amid wave of criticism,"(Reuters) - Mylan NV said on Thursday it would reduce the out-of-pocket costs of its emergency EpiPen allergy injection for some patients amid a wave of criticism from lawmakers and the public over the products rapidly escalating price. The list price of the drug will remain the same, but the company said it would increase the maximum copay assistance program to $300 from $100 for patients who pay for the 2-pak in cash or who are covered by a commercial health insurer. The price of EpiPen has skyrocketed to $600 from $100 since it was acquired by Mylan in 2007.  Mylan also said it is doubling the eligibility for its patient assistance program, which will eliminate out-of-pocket costs for uninsured and under-insured patients and families. Government paid programs are not eligible for the copay assistance program. Ronny Gal, an analyst with Bernstein, said when all is said and done he estimates a total price reduction for EpiPen of 32 percent. The price rose 27 percent in the second quarter of 2016 versus the same quarter a year ago. Thus we are basically rolling back the increase of the past year, he said. In all, we estimate that todays news results in a 20-25 percent hit on EpiPen revenues. He expects that to translate into a 3-4 percent hit to Mylans earnings per share over the next few years. He estimates the company will earn $4.77 a share in 2016 and $5.58 in 2017. Mylan is the latest company to be caught up in the growing outrage at apparently egregious drug price increases. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc and Turing Pharmaceuticals have both been publicly excoriated for similar price increases. Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who has spoken out against escalating drug prices, welcomes the fact that Mylan is now apparently open to taking steps to lower some of the cost sharing burdens imposed on families, Tyrone Gayle, a campaign spokesman, said in a statement. However, he added, discounts for selected customers without lowering the overall price of EpiPens are insufficient, because the excessive price will likely be passed on through higher insurance premiums. Clintons view was echoed by Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. Elijah Cummings, who said Mylans move is nothing but a public relations stunt that does nothing to help the majority of patients who need the drug. Offering a meager discount only after widespread bipartisan criticism is exactly the same tactic used by drug companies across the industry to distract from their exorbitant price increases, he said in a statement. Nobody is buying this PR move any more. Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, defending the price in an interview on Thursday on CNBC, said her company had spent hundreds of millions of dollars improving EpiPen, including making its needle invisible, since acquiring the device from German generic drugmaker Merck KGaA.  When we picked up this product, they (Merck) werent spending a dollar on it, said Bresch,  Bresch said Mylan recoups less than half of EpiPens list price because pharmacy benefit managers, which often require discounted prices or rebates from drugmakers, are involved, along with insurers and others. Democratic U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar said Mylans action was a welcome relief to many who are struggling to afford the medication, but said it does not address the root of the problem of rising drug costs. Earlier this year, Clinton chastised drug companies for exorbitant pricing and unveiled a plan that she said would cut costs, making the issue not only a hot election discussion topic but potentially an issue that could have policy implications if she is elected. On Wednesday, Clinton pressed Mylan to voluntarily cut the EpiPen price, sending the companys share price lower and pushing down biotech stocks. Mylan shares fell more than 10 percent this week before rising 3.2 percent on Thursday after announcement of the discount program. EpiPens are preloaded injections of epinephrine (adrenaline) used in case of a dangerous allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis that could cause death if untreated. Anaphylaxis can occur in as little as a couple of minutes of exposure to the allergen, which can come in the form of food such as peanuts or insects such as bees. Certain medications or latex can also cause a severe reaction. Symptoms include itching, swelling of the lips, tongue and roof of the mouth, tight chestedness and difficulty breathing. People who are susceptible to such reactions are frequently advised to carry an EpiPen, which can deliver an immediate emergency jolt of adrenaline to reverse the symptoms.      A group of lawmakers said on Wednesday they had written the U.S. Food and Drug Administration asking about its approval process for alternatives to the EpiPen. FDA spokeswoman Theresa Eisenman said in a statement the agency is reviewing the questions posed in the letter and will respond directly to the Congressional members. She noted that the FDA does not have the authority to review or approve drug prices. Bresch, daughter of Democratic U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, said she contacted members of Congress over the past two days and asked to meet with them to discuss what she called an unsustainable drug pricing system. She said one of the calls was to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who recently wrote a letter to Mylan asking for an explanation of big EpiPen price increases. ",1.0
 REPORT: Trump Illegally Used Charity Money To Jumpstart Presidential Campaign,"A new report from RealClearPolitics is detailing what might be another illegal endeavor of Donald Trump at the behest of his  charitable foundation  (which has already been caught illegally using funds to pay off lawsuits).From 2011 to 2014, leading up to his presidential announcement (and speculation in 2012), the Trump Foundation donated nearly $300,000 to various conservative groups and organizations.IRS laws clearly state that charity executives may not use a foundation  funds to finance personal endeavors that benefit said executives.In 2011, Trump met with South Carolina conservative activist Oran Smith with the intent for, as Smith puts it,  laying the foundation for a   campaign.  After the meeting between the two, Trump, using foundation money, donated $10,000 to Smith s organization, the Palmetto Family Council.According to RealClearPolitics:In many cases, this flow of money corresponded to prime speaking slots or endorsements that aided Trump as he sought to recast himself as a plausible Republican candidate for president. Although sources familiar with the thinking behind the donations cautioned that Trump did not explicitly ask for favors in return for the money, they said the contributions were part of a deliberate effort by Trump to ingratiate himself with influential conservatives and brighten his political prospects.Talk about real pay-for-play.Using Foundation money to monetarily influence, even slightly, those who could (and would) catapult his political career (a personal endeavor) is still illegal under IRS laws   no matter how many technicalities Trump and his lawyers want to argue.In almost all instances, these conservative organizations, with considerable political influence, invited the billionaire mogul and provided endorsements after he donated thousands of dollars to their cause.Another high profile donation was made to The Family Leader organization, a socially conservative think tank that featured Trump as a keynote speaker at one of their most prestigious events in 2013. Trump was featured as the keynote speaker after giving $10,000 like he did with the Palmetto Family Council. RealClearPolitics points out that Trump may have broken IRS rules by giving directly to the organization and not its affiliated nonprofit branch, thus pitting Trump in a  double whammy  on unethical, illegal political meanderings.After Trump donated $100,000 to Citizens United, a Koch-backed political entity:In April 2014, when Citizens United hosted a  cattle call  of would-be Republican candidates for president in New Hampshire, Trump was there. In January 2015, at Citizens United s Freedom Summit in Iowa, Trump was again on the program.This won t bode well, especially for a guy who s  under audit  from the IRS. We now know why, apparently.While Republicans try to find something, anything, to pit Clinton against her foundation, the GOP is ignoring the obvious abuses of Trump and his. This double standard from the right should not surprise anyone   their candidate is failing and they need to divert any negative attention away from him. This is the party of  Christian values  at work.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",0.0

"Turkey's border with northern Iraq remains open, for now, minister says","ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey s border with northern Iraq remains open, although that does not mean it will remain so, the Turkish customs minister said on Wednesday, adding the number of trucks passing through had decreased. Bulent Tufenkci also said he did not believe that the Kurdish independence referendum in northern Iraq would have a big impact on Turkish trade with Baghdad.   President Tayyip Erdogan has said Iraqi Kurds would go hungry if his country halts the flow of trucks and oil across the border, warning that Turkey could take military and economic measures against its neighbor after the referendum  The Habur border gate is open for now, we see that the numbers of vehicles passing are decreased,  Tufenkci said, referring to the main border crossing with northern Iraq.   The Habur border gate being open for now does not mean that it will remain open,  he said in comments broadcast live on television. Turkey, home to the region s largest Kurdish population, has been battling a three-decade insurgency in its largely Kurdish southeast and fears the referendum, held earlier this week, will inflame separatist tension at home.  We can continue trading with the Iraqi central government through Iran or via sea or airways,  Tufenkci said. Turkey has long been northern Iraq s main link to the outside world, with a Turkish oil pipeline connecting northern Iraq to global energy markets. Iraq, including the Kurdish region, was Turkey s third-largest export market in 2016, according to IMF data. Turkish exports to the country totaled $8.6 billion, behind Germany and the United Kingdom. ",1.0

During an interview on Capitol Hill, Johnson said the slayings of James Foley and Steven Sotloff should not lead to bombing ISIS forces in Syria.  We were on their ground. It was not in the U.S. I do think we need to protect Americans wherever they are. But Americans also need to be careful where they are,  said Johnson.

 Rabbis Cancel Annual Call With President Over Trumps Open Support Of White Supremacists,"Rabbis representing four prominent Jewish organizations have decided that they will not hold their annual conference call with the President because the man currently holding that office openly supports white supremacists.Following Trump s atrocious response to the tragic events in Charlottesville, the rabbis issued a statement explaining that they simply  cannot organize such a call this year.  They said that this decision was made because Trump s reaction to Nazis marching in the streets and the death of Heather Heyer was  lacking in moral leadership and empathy for the victims of racial and religious hatred. We have concluded that President Trump s statements during and after the tragic events in Charlottesville are so lacking in moral leadership and empathy for the victims of racial and religious hatred that we cannot organize such a call this year,  the rabbis wrote. The President s words have given succor to those who advocate anti-Semitism, racism, and xenophobia,  they wrote.  Responsibility for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, including the death of Heather Heyer, does not lie with many sides but with one side: the Nazis, alt-right and white supremacists who brought their hate to a peaceful community. They must be roundly condemned at all levels. In the days following the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that left three people dead, Trump insisted that  many sides  were to blame for the violence. The rabbis concluded by saying that they would  pray that President Trump will recognize and remedy the grave error he has made in abetting the voices of hatred.   They added that they will also  pray that those who traffic in anti-Semitism, racism, and xenophobia will see that there is no place for such pernicious philosophies in a civilized society. The statement was signed by the Central Conference of American Rabbis, The Rabbinical Assembly, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association and the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism.Featured image via Bill Pugliano/Getty Images",0.0
 Watch Steven Colberts Hilarious Summary of Trumps Crazy Week,"For anyone who s been paying attention to Donald Trump, you can t help but wonder how in the world this individual is leading polls by a large gap for the Republican nomination to be president of the United States. After watching Stephen Colbert s analysis of Trump s week, one can only conclude that there are many not so smart Republican voters out there.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Oo0RcL4PJw]Take, for example, Trump s visit to Liberty University to attract the Evangelical vote. During his speech, Trump misnamed a book in the Bible.  Trump loves the Bible so much he doesn t even need to read it, apparently because he had a little trouble with one of the names of the books of the Bible  Second Corinthians ,  said Colbert. Then he showed a clip of Trump calling it  Two Corinthians.   It s like two Corinthians walk into a bar  mused Colbert. Trump however did compliment the Bible, saying that it  blows away  his book, The Art of The Deal.Do these folks actually believe that Trump is religious or that he even pays attention to the Bible? If they do, they seem to be either quite delusional or not so smart. They re probably both.Then there s the apparent endorsement of the dead John Wayne. Trump was endorsed at the John Wayne Museum by the famous actor s daughter, who said that if her dad were alive today, Trump would be his guy. Colbert said: That s right,with Trump s new-found spirituality, Trump has reached through the veil of death and dragged back the endorsement of John Wayne. The unfolding Trump saga and his crazy support base is humorous when Colbert sums it up but it s also quite frightening that this guy leads in the polls.Featured Image Via YouTube Screenshot.",0.0
SENATORS UP IN ARMS OVER OBAMA ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO MOVE GITMO TO TWO DIFFERENT STATES,"Obama is hell bent on closing GITMO before he leaves office even if it s the wrong move. His legacy comes before what s right for all Americans and he s got a couple Senators really peeved. Obama s latest plan is to move GITMO to South Carolina and Kansas. You guessed it, the Senators from those two states are not having any of it! Remember when Obama tried this 7 years ago? It didn t go over well then but it seems desperation has kicked in and he s trying to dump the GITMO prisoners in states again. Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Pat Roberts of Kansas are up in arms about reports that the Pentagon is scouting sites in their home states to house terrorist prisoners currently detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. We have received reports of President Obama s attempt to shut down Guantanamo Bay, which once again reflects another egregious overstep by this administration,  Roberts said in a statement on Friday, referring to the law preventing transferring any of the inmates to a U.S. prison. Congress has consistently stopped Obama by law from moving a single detainee to the U.S.,  Roberts said in reaction to reports that Kansas s Fort Leavenworth is being considered as the terrorist suspects  new home. I shut down this administration s nominee for secretary of the Army in 2009 to prevent moving any detainees to Kansas and will do it again if necessary,  he said.  Not on my watch will any terrorist be placed in Kansas. Graham was equally emphatic upon learning that Defense Secretary Ash Carter is also considering Charleston for the new high-risk installation. If the detainees need to be moved, they must be moved to a maximum security location in a remote area far from heavily populated areas with vital infrastructure,  Graham told the Washington Post earlier this week.  Charleston does not meet that criteria. The Pentagon on Thursday confirmed to lawmakers that it is studying both Forth Leavenworth and the Consolidated Naval Brig in Charleston as potential sites.Via: WE ",0.0
FURIOUS FBI Agents Speak Out On Clinton Email Case: We didnt search their house. We always search the house.,"FBI Agents are coming forward now to voice their frustrations and concerns about FBI Director James Comey s inept policing of the FBI. Specifically, the Clinton email investigation was held up by Comey standing in the way. One of the specifics of the investigation that hindered it was that the Clinton house was never searched. The FBI always does a search of a household in an investigation. The New York FBI agents working the case were livid at the stonewalling in the Clinton case. FBI agents are now lawyering up and speaking up to tell what they know This is a textbook case where a grand jury should have convened but was not. That is appalling,  an FBI special agent who has worked public corruption and criminal cases said of the decision.  We talk about it in the office and don t know how Comey can keep going. DID ANYONE ELSE THINK THIS EXACT SAME THING:The agent was also surprised that the bureau did not bother to search Clinton s house during the investigation. We didn t search their house. We always search the house. The search should not just have been for private electronics, which contained classified material, but even for printouts of such material,  he said. There should have been a complete search of their residence,  the agent pointed out.  That the FBI did not seize devices is unbelievable. The FBI even seizes devices that have been set on fire. Another special agent for the bureau that worked counter-terrorism and criminal cases said he is offended by Comey s saying:  we  and  I ve been an investigator. The idea that the Clinton/e-mail case didn t go to a grand jury is ridiculous. According to Washington D.C. attorney Joe DiGenova, more FBI agents will be talking about the problems at bureau and specifically the handling of the Clinton case by Comey when Congress comes back into session and decides to force them to testify by subpoena. People are starting to talk. They re calling their former friends outside the bureau asking for help. We were asked to day to provide legal representation to people inside the bureau and agreed to do so and to former agents who want to come forward and talk. Comey thought this was going to go away. The most important thing of all is that the agents have decided that they are going to talk. Read more: Daily Caller",0.0
Scores of migrants rescued in Cyprus after boat runs aground,"NICOSIA (Reuters) - Around 175 migrants, including many women and children, were rescued off Cyprus on Friday after their boat ran aground, police said. The vessel was tracked sailing off Cyprus s north-west coast. Authorities said those on board were being escorted to a nearby harbor. The nationality of the migrants and their port of departure were not immediately clear. In September, more than 300 Syrian refugees arrived in the same area, a patchwork of jurisdictions that borders on the ceasefire line splitting Cyprus between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, with a United Nations  buffer zone  in the middle. The waves of migrants fleeing neighboring Syria have largely skirted the island, but there has been an increase in landings in recent months. Earlier on Friday, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said 850 people had made illicit landings in Cyprus so far this year, compared with 345 in 2016.     ",1.0
#CNNBlackmail Trending as Network Blackmails Trump Meme Reddit User,"21st Century WireYesterday, US mainstream media outlet CNN threatened to expose the identity of a Reddit user who is said to have created the spoof  WWF  video meme which was Tweeted by President Donald Trump on Sunday morning, showing Trump in a cartoon fight with CNN.This was the offending Tweet which Trump released on Sunday morning, including a video meme gleaned from Reddit: #FraudNewsCNN #FNN pic.twitter.com/WYUnHjjUjg  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 2, 2017Apparently, CNN was so distraught over Trump s online prank which CNN claimed promoted violence against reporters    that the cable news network tried (unsuccessfully) to get Twitter to remove it from their website.CNN then went on to report on Monday boasting about how they trolled and tracked the Reddit user under the handle HanAssholeSolo who had created the original meme.The following day on Tuesday, the Reddit user made a public apology (since deleted, but posted here at Buzzfeed News). But the apology wasn t voluntary   as CNN appears to have blackmailed the man.Ultimately, CNN decided not to reveal his identity  not for safety reasons, but for political ones, apparently rewarding him for apologizing and recanting his views. In addition, CNN threatened to expose the Reddit user s identity in future if it disapproved of his behavior or his statements   essentially blackmailing him:Now, CNN has been accused of both threatening and blackmailing the creator of the wrestling meme.CNN s KFile  discovered the real identity of the Reddit user credited with creating the meme, HanA**holeSolo, and tried to contact him. The meme creator then apologized on Reddit, saying he doesn t advocate violence against the media. According to CNN, he then got in touch with KFile and asked not to be named. CNN also said that it would not publish the man s name, because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology,  and that CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change. As a result of the controversy, the hashtag #CNNBlackmail has been trending on Twitter.The online backlash has been hard and swift, as thousands of Tweets reveal the scale of public distaste for CNN:""CNN: The Most Trusted Name In Silencing Political Dissent""#CNNBlackmail pic.twitter.com/w0Lpl2ZGc2  Wrongthink Warlord (@NoSlackDelta) July 5, 2017If anyone tried to do what CNN just did on reddit, twitter or almost any online community   they would get instanstly banned. #CNNBlackmail pic.twitter.com/JbtRNPDUYK  Murad Gazdiev (@MuradGazdiev) July 5, 2017CNN tracks a 15 year old meme maker down in a few days but can't prove Russia conspiracy in over a year. #CNNBlackmail  Randy Newton (@threezeroleft) July 5, 2017It s no surprise that CNN reputation has been steadily tanking following a string of fake news reports regarding President Trump and Russia, along with some of the most abysmal journalism ever seen in modern times during its coverage of the 2016 election where it openly backed the eventual loser, Hillary Clinton, as well as continuous bogus reporting coming out of Syria where CNN has repeatedly laid the false claim that,  Assad is gassing his own people.

The Safe Welfare State Of Sweden Descends Into AnarchyMuslim Refugee Situation Out Of Control,"The Swedes have apparently reached their limit on  tolerance  for Muslim refugees who have no intention of assimilating. Since 1975, rapes in Sweden have increased by 1,475%! You have to understand that Swedes are really scared when an asylum house opens in their village. They can see what has happened in other places.    Salesman for alarm systems.Since Parliament decided in 1975 that Sweden should be multicultural and not Swedish, crime has exploded. Violent crime has increased by over 300% and rapes have increased by an unbelievable 1,472%.Many Swedes see the mass immigration as a forced marriage: Sweden is forced to marry a man she did not choose, yet she is expected to love and honor him, even though he beats her and treats her badly. Her parents (the government) tell her to be warm and show solidarity with him. Are the State and I now in agreement that our mutual contract is being renegotiated?    Alexandra von Schwerin, whose farm who was robbed three times. Police refused to help.Once upon a time, there was a safe welfare state called Sweden, where people rarely locked their doors.Now, this country is a night-watchman state   each man is on his own. When the Minister of Justice, Morgan Johansson, encourages breaking the law, it means opening the gates to anarchy. Mr. and Mrs. Swede have every reason to be worried, with the influx of 190,000 unskilled and unemployed migrants expected this year   equivalent to 2% of Sweden s current population. The number is as if 6.4 million penniless migrants who did not speak English arrived in U.S. in one year, or 1.3 million in Britain.And the Swedes are preparing: demand for firearms licenses is increasing; more and more Swedes are joining shooting clubs and starting vigilante groups. After a slight dip in 2014, the number of new gun permits has gone up significantly again this year. According to police statistics, there are 1,901,325 licensed guns, owned by 567,733 people, in Sweden. Add to this an unknown number of illegal weapons. To get a gun permit in Sweden, you need to be at least 18 years old; law-abiding; well-behaved, and have a hunting license or be a member of an approved shooting club. In 2014, 11,000 people got a hunting license: 10% more than the year before. One out of five was a woman. There is also a high demand for alarm systems right now,  says a salesman at one of the security companies in an interview with Gatestone. It is largely due to the turbulence we are seeing around the country at the moment.  People have lost confidence in the State, he added.  The police will not come anymore. Truck drivers say that when they see a thief emptying the fuel tank of their trucks, they run out with a baseball bat. It is no use calling the police, but if you hit the thief, you can at least prevent him from stealing more diesel. Many homeowners say the same thing: they sleep with a baseball bat under the bed. But this is risky: the police can then say you have been prepared to use force, and that might backfire on you. The salesman, who asked to remain anonymous, also spoke of Sweden s many Facebook groups, in which people in different villages openly discuss how they intend to protect themselves:  Sometimes you get totally freaked out when you see what they are writing. But you have to understand that Swedes are really scared when an asylum house opens in their village. They can see what has happened in other places. One blog, detailing the consequences for the local population when an asylum facility opens, is aptly named Asylkaos ( Asylum Chaos ). There is a list of companies the reader is prompted to boycott; the blog claims these businesses encourage the transformation of Sweden to a multicultural society, and are therefore considered  hostile to Swedes. At another security company, a salesman said that every time the Immigration Service buys or rents a new housing facility, his firm is swamped with calls.  The next day,  he said,  half the village calls and wants to buy alarm systems. Ronny Fredriksson, spokesman of the security company Securitas, said that the demand for home alarm systems first exploded about six years ago, when many local police stations were shut down and police moved to the main towns. This, he said, could result in response times of several hours.  More and more people now employ the services of our security guards. Shopping malls and stores in the city come together and hire guards. We are kind of like the  local beat  cops of old. Even though Securitas makes big money from the increased need for home security alarms and security guards, Fredriksson says they also are worried about the effect on society: The problem is that we too need the police. When our guards catch a burglar or a violent person, we call the police but the response times are often very long. Sometimes, the detainees get violent and quite rowdy. On occasion, the police have told us to release the person we have apprehended, if we have his identity, because they do not have a patrol nearby. Even before the massive influx of migrants in the fall of 2015, Swedes felt a need to protect themselves   and with good reason. Since the Parliament decided in 1975 that Sweden should be multicultural and not Swedish, crime has exploded. Violent crime has increased by more than 300%, and rapes have increased by an unbelievable 1,472%.The politicians, however, ignore the people s fear completely. It is never discussed. Instead, the people who express concern about what kind of country Sweden has become are accused of xenophobia and racism. Most likely, that is the reason more and more people are taking matters into their own hands, and protecting themselves and their families to the best of their ability.All the same, some people do not settle for that. It seems some people are trying to stop mass immigration to Sweden. Almost every day there are reports of fires being set at asylum houses. So far, miraculously, no one has been hurt. These fires are set not only by Swedes. On October 13, a 36-year-old woman living in Skellefte  was convicted of setting fire to the asylum facility in which she herself resided. The woman claimed she lit a candle and then fell asleep. Yet forensic evidence showed that a combustible fluid had been doused throughout the room, and the court found beyond a reasonable doubt that she herself had ignited the fire.

"Islamic State hostages, strongholds stand between U.S.-backed forces and Raqqa's capture","RAQQA, Syria (Reuters) - Raqqa s hospital, a big complex pocked with bullets holes, whose capture will signal the end of Islamic State s crumbling Syrian capital, lies just 200 yards from a front-line base of the Syrian Democratic Forces. Beyond it, a roundabout where the jihadists once displayed the heads of their enemies, crucified people and held military parades at the height of their expansion is another strategic prize sought by the U.S.-backed militia alliance. Commanders directing the battle on the ground say seizing these and a nearby stadium, Islamic State s last strongholds in the city, could take as little as a week once a final assault begins against just a few hundred remaining militants. But the ultra-hardline group is holding civilian hostages in the hospital and stadium and using sniper fire, booby traps and tunnels that emerge behind SDF lines to slow the battle. The SDF faces a tough final showdown with IS which commanders say will end at the hospital, now almost completely surrounded.  There are many civilians being held. We can t use heavy weaponry or air strikes around the hospital or stadium, so we ll encircle them as we advance,  commander Haval Gabar said at the front-line base, a home that SDF units captured last week.  The hospital will be the last point (in Raqqa) to be freed,  he said on Saturday, as bullets coming from the sprawling medical complex whizzed over the base. The SDF, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias dominated by the Kurdish YPG, has been fighting since June to drive Islamic State from Raqqa city, backed by air strikes and special forces from a U.S.-led coalition. The assault, which YPG officials initially predicted would take weeks, has dragged on as Islamic State bogs down forces with tactics used in other bastions such as Iraq s Mosul. Senior Kurdish commanders recently said Raqqa would fall by the end of October.   Right now there s no advancing,  Gabar, 25, said.  There have been many attacks from behind us  with militants launching surprise raids from a network of tunnels they dug after marauding through swathes of Syria and Iraq and capturing Raqqa in 2014, he said.  When that happens we divert forces from front-line assaults to deal with the infiltration. But it doesn t take long, maybe half an hour to deal with each attack.  The home the SDF was using as a base had an IS tunnel emerging into its living room - now blocked up with furniture. Commander Zilzal Tarhams said militants emerged from a second nearby tunnel two days before and fired a rocket into a house occupied by the SDF.  If we find tunnels we usually cave them in with explosives. There are so many,  he said. The commanders were confident of total victory soon, however, with Islamic State surrounded in a small portion of the city which houses the remaining strategic sites. Gabar, who directs fighting on the western front, said forces were waiting for the order for a final push, after which the roundabout, stadium and hospital would quickly fall.  When we begin it will be quick, maybe 10 days or so,  he said. Tarhams predicted a week.  It s really because of the civilians presence that it s taking us some time,  Gabar said. There were thousands of residents still trapped in the city, including an unknown number at the stadium and hospital, he said. Air strikes that have been used heavily in other parts of the city are not as frequent around the remaining sites, although missiles still slam into buildings in the city center. Gabar and Tarhams did not say how the SDF planned to capture the stadium and hospital, both of which provide high vantage points over the city center, while avoiding the deaths of residents held there. Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi commanded his militants not to negotiate or surrender in an audio message released recently. Raqqa s complete capture will end the group s sway in the city from where it plotted deadly attacks abroad, and projected its power in 2014 parading through streets flying black flags on military vehicles. The two SDF commanders estimated there were no more than 350 militants left in Raqqa and said these were not the elite of the group. Many leaders are believed to have fled to Deir al-Zor where the SDF and Syrian government forces are pressing competing offensives against IS. Other tactics the jihadists were using to slow SDF advances include laying booby traps, Tarhams said.  They put mines under rugs in homes and use motion sensors to set off bombs. It s a huge obstacle.  Battle weary, the commanders were keen to capture the last strategic sites as soon as possible.  We want to finish before winter - bad weather makes it harder to advance,  Gabar said.  We ll need months to fully clear the explosives afterwards - that s going to be an even bigger job.  ",1.0

Jordan border crossing with Iraq to reopen in major boost to ties,"AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan will open its main border crossing with Iraq on Wednesday for the first time since 2015, now that Iraqi forces have gained control of the main highway to Baghdad from Islamic State militants, both governments said. Iraqi troops pulled out of the Tureibil post, on the 180 km (110 mile) border, in summer 2014 after the militants secured nearly all the official crossings of the western frontier as they swept through a third of the country. Commercial traffic continued for a year after until Iraq launched an offensive in July 2015 to reclaim the predominately Sunni Anbar province and deprive the militants of funds raised from truck drivers forced to pay a tax on cargo coming in from Jordan. Tureibil would open on Wednesday after the road was secured  from attacks and criminal gangs,  the Iraqi and Jordanian governments said in a joint statement. Officials have said that customs and border arrangements have been finalised, with security measures in place to ensure the 550 km highway from the border to Baghdad was safe.  The opening of the crossing is of great importance to Jordan and Iraq ... It s a crucial artery. Jordan and Iraq have been discussing reopening it for a while,  Interior Minister Ghaleb al Zubi said last week. Several trade and business officials had said they had been invited to an event on Wednesday to mark the re-opening that would include senior Jordanian and Iraqi officials. Since last year, the Iraqi army has regained most of Anbar province s main towns that fell to the ultra-hardline jihadist group. The vast desert province is an historic hotbed of the hardline Sunni insurgency sparked by 2003 s U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, which empowered the oil-rich nation s Shi ite majority. Iraq has also been working on securing the highway that  connects Iraq s Basra port in the south to Jordan, where the Red Sea port of Aqaba has long served as a gateway for Iraqi imports coming from Europe. Although the highway has been secured after driving out the jihadists, the threat of hit-and run attacks on convoys and the army are ever present, according to security experts.  There have been several attacks by militants near al-Rutba town, the last town before the border with Jordan. A senior Western diplomatic said Iraqi authorities have awarded a contract to a U.S. security company that will employ a local force to secure the highway. The source gave no further details.  Jordan hopes the reopening of the route will revive exports to Iraq, once the kingdom s main export market, accounting that accounted for almost a fifth of domestic exports or about $1.2 billion a year, according to the International Monetary Fund. They have fallen by more than 50 percent from pre-crisis levels.  This will increase industrial exports and also revive the two countries  trucking industry. It s a major boost to the economy,  Nael Husami, general manager of the Amman Chamber of Industry, adding transport costs would fall by nearly half. Jordanian exporters have had to use more expensive sea routes to Iraq s Um Qasr port or another land route across Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, businessmen have said.  The restoration of trade links will also give a push to an oil pipeline project running from Basra to Aqaba. Prime Minister Hani al Mulki had visited Baghdad earlier this year to revive the frozen project. Jordanian officials are hopeful the crossing with Syria on its northern border can also open by the end of the year once a U.S.-Russian de-escalation zone in southwest Syria that includes the area is cemented. The International Monetary Fund recently said that prolonged conflicts in neighbouring Syria and Iraq were weighing on the kingdom s debt-ridden economy and the opening of these export routes would boost economic growth.

 Top First Amendment Lawyer Makes MIND-BLOWING Suggestion To Media: Sue Trump (TWEET),"The election of reality television star Donald Trump has people all over the world responding in various ways. Some of us are in total shock, despair and disbelief, and some of us are finding creative ways to resist this presidency. First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams is amongst those raising eyebrows with an unprecedented suggestion for Americans.On Wednesday night, during a dinner hosted by the Media Law Resource Center, the top lawyer made a suggestion that shocked everyone. First, he called Trump  the greatest threat to the First Amendment since the passage of the Sedition Act of 1798.  And then he surprised everyone again when he suggested that reporters should think about suing Trump.When Abrams, who is the most well-known First Amendment lawyer in the country, was asked for clarification, he said: It s seems to be that in light of the attacks made by then-Candidate Trump against the press on a continuing basis his preventing certain journalists from even attending his rallies as part of the press corps because he disapproved for their writing, and his public comments about wanting to loosen American libel law the press ought to be thinking broadly about how to defend itself if his Administration turns out to be as antagonistic to the press as may be the case. Abrams also cited libel law, and suggested that Trump be sued by the media for defamation. Abrams warned the press that it should be trying to protect itself, as Trump has threatened several times to prevent the media from speaking negatively about him. It may well be necessary to think outside the box in response to a deliberately repressive administration. It s because the level of hostility to the press, and perhaps the willingness to limit or punish press criticism may reach a new height in this administration. Although Abrams mentioned that this would be a first for American journalists, maybe it s time that changed. The press is used to defending libel cases. That s a good part to what I ve done in my career. So as to protect free speech and free expression as much as possible. I m not seeking to move away from that. My plea is to bear in mind that one of the potential weapons is that when anyone president or shoemaker defames an entity, and speaks falsely and maliciously, one of the possible responses is to bring a libel suit. Trump has spent days on Twitter bashing the media and condemning journalists for speaking the truth about him. Even after the election, Trump has continued to criticize the media for doing its job.

U.S. MOSQUE LINKED TO TERRORIST GROUP Received $2.7 MILLION In Federal Funding,"It s interesting to note the terrorist organization linked to this mosque (and funded with our taxpayer dollars), is same terror group Obama and the Democrats supported during the Arab Spring uprising in Egypt A Kansas City mosque owned by an Islamic umbrella organization with deep ties to the U.S. arm of the Muslim Brotherhood has received millions of dollars in federal grants over the past several years, according to a federal spending database.The Islamic Center of Greater Kansas City has received $2,739,891 from the Department of Agriculture since 2010, a Daily Caller analysis has found. The money largely went to the mosque s Crescent Clinic to provide services through the Women, Infant and Children nutrition program, known as WIC.The most recent federal payment   in the amount of $327,436   was handed out Oct. 1. Property records show the mosque is owned by the North American Islamic Trust (NAIT), which acts as a financial holding company for Islamic organizations. It offers sharia-compliant financial products to Muslim investors, operates Islamic schools and owns more than 300 other mosques throughout the U.S.Founded in 1973 as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood-backed Muslim Students Association, NAIT s most controversial connection is to the 2007 and 2008 Holy Land Foundation terror financing cases. Along with other Muslim Brotherhood-linked organizations like the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), NAIT was named a co-conspirator in the federal case but was not indicted.At the Holy Land Foundation trial, evidence was presented that ISNA diverted funds from the accounts it held with NAIT to institutions linked to Hamas and to Mousa Abu Marzook, a senior Hamas leader.Federal prosecutors introduced evidence in the case that  established that ISNA and NAIT were among those organizations created by the U.S.-Muslim Brotherhood.  Hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of checks drawn from ISNA s account and deposited in the Holy Land Foundation s account with NAIT were made payable to  the Palestinian Mujahadeen,  which is the original name for Hamas  military wing.While Hamas was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. government in 1997 and is considered the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, the larger Muslim Brotherhood is not itself designated as a terrorist group.And while the Obama administration has largely remained agnostic towards the organization, the British government released a scathing report earlier this month noting that the Muslim Brotherhood remains supportive of Hamas and that much of its ideology and many of its tactics  are contrary to our values and have been contrary to our national interests and our national security.

" Trump Embarrasses U.S., Brags About Election Win In Joint Press Conference With Trudeau (VIDEO)","Amateur president Donald Trump met with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday to speak in a joint press conference, and he thoroughly embarrassed the U.S. again by feeding his ego in front of the entire world. The topic of Syrian refugees was brought up by a reporter, and of course, Trump had to bring up his election victory. President Trump, you seemed to suggest that Syrian refugees are a Trojan horse for potential terrorism, while the prime minister hugs refugees and welcomes them with open arms,  a reporter asked.  Are you confident the northern border is secure? You can never be totally confident,  Trump replied. Trump heaped praise on Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly for doing a  great job  of deporting  very, very hardened criminals  so far, as reported by Talking Points Memo. That s what I said I would do. I m just doing what I said I would do, and we won by a very, very large electoral college vote,  Trump said.Trump went on to say that he  knew  he would win the election. That s an odd statement to make since he admitted to being surprised that he won after the election during his thank you tour following the election. I knew this is what people were wanting. That wasn t the only reason, that wasn t my only thing that we did so well on, but that was something that was very important,  Trump said.  I think that in the end, everyone is going to be extremely happy. And I will tell you right now, a lot of people are very, very happy right now. Watch:A lot of people are not  very happy right now  as Trump suggested. His approval rating is tanking like the Titanic. Before taking the oath of office, Trump s approval rating as president-elect was the worst in modern history, and it s gotten even worse since Inauguration Day. Trump s disapproval rating has risen 5 percentage points since just last week. Since his  election,  Trump has witnessed mass protests across the country. The Women s March on Washington, which took place the day after he was sworn in, garnered a far larger crowd than his inauguration. Nope, people are not  happy right now,  but he knows that. That s why he repeatedly brings up his election victory and most times, tries to claim he won the popular vote by saying that 3 million people voted illegally in the U.S. election. That s nearly the same number by which Hillary Clinton won the popular vote.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images.",0.0
Republican McConnell holds out hope for Obamacare repeal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mitch McConnell, the U.S. Senates top Republican, clung to slim hopes on Tuesday that his party could still dismantle Obamacare, despite not having adequate support for a repeal bill. Facing the possibility of another failure to make good on their 7-year-old pledge to roll back the healthcare law, McConnell told senators the debate on healthcare would continue. He said nothing about whether he would bring the repeal bill to a vote, leaving open the option of letting the measure simply die if more firm votes for it cannot be nailed down. Republicans have vowed for years to get rid of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, but they are up against a Sept. 30 deadline to pass a bill with a simple majority, or face a much tougher path toward dismantling it. Senator Susan Collins rebuffed intense lobbying from fellow Republicans and the promise of money for her state when she decided on Monday to oppose - and likely doom - the latest effort to repeal Obamacare. It was a blow for President Donald Trump who has made undoing Democratic former President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law a top priority since the 2016 campaign and who pressured Collins in a call on Monday. Republicans hold a slim 52-48 majority in the Senate and  at least two other Republican senators, John McCain and Rand Paul, have already rejected the bill. No votes from McCain, Collins and another Republican, Lisa Murkowski, killed an effort by the Senate to undo Obamacare in July. While Obamacare extended health insurance to some 20 million Americans, many Republicans believe it is an unwarranted and costly government intrusion into healthcare, while also opposing taxes it imposed on the wealthy. McConnell opened the Senate on Tuesday by praising the measure, which is sponsored by Republican senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy. He said it contrasted sharply with Democratic proposals for single-payer healthcare. Its an important debate for our country, McConnell said. Its one that will certainly continue. The Graham-Cassidy bill would take federal money spent on the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled, as well as subsidies to help Americans buy private insurance, and divvy it up to the states in block grants. One main complaint by opponents of the bill is that it would mean sweeping cuts in funding to Medicaid. ",1.0
"REPORT: ANTI-TRUMP, Open-Borders Clooneys No Longer Feel Secure In EnglandMoving Back To U.S","Actor and immigration activist George Clooney will move to Los Angeles with his wife Amal and newborn twins Ella and Alexander due to security concerns at his England estate, according to a report.Life & Style magazine reported last week that the 56-year-old Oscar-winner will move his newly-expanded family to his mansion in Studio City, California, after deeming his 17th century mansion in Sonning, England to be not sufficiently safe for them. As soon as Amal found out she was pregnant, he hired former Secret Service agents to assess all his properties and make recommendations for improvement,  an unnamed Clooney  insider  told the magazine.  His mansion in Studio City [Calif.] was deemed the most secure, and it s within minutes of an LAPD station. He doesn t feel like Amal and the twins are safe living in the English countryside,  the source told Life & Style.  He s determined to move his family to LA, where he feels much more secure. The report comes as England has been rocked by terrorist attacks in recent months, including the terrorist bombing of a concert by pop singer Ariana Grande in Manchester in June that claimed the lives of 22 people, many of them young children.In May, British government officials disclosed that 23,000 known jihadi terrorists are believed to be residing in Britain, far more than the 3,000 that had initially been reported.The move for the Clooneys comes as both George and Amal have been among the most vocal and active celebrity advocates for open borders and the free flow of refugees between countries.In February of last year, the actor met privately with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and praised the German leader s acceptance of refugees from Syria and other countries. The same month, Clooney told Sky News in an interview that the United States is not doing  enough  to help Syrian refugees, and that 10,000 refugees per year was too low a figure to be admitting into the country.In an April 2016 interview with the BBC, Amal Clooney criticized then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump s plans to build a security wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, telling the outlet that the plan does not represent  U.S. values. George has also been an outspoken critic of Trump, telling The Guardian in a March 2016 interview that he believes Trump to be a  xenophobic fascist  and an  opportunist.  He previously described Trump s immigration policy proposals as  idiotic  and  intolerant.   Breitbart In July, 2016, it was reported that the Clooney s were considering moving from their mansion in Italy after a massive makeshift refugee camp was established in Lake Como, the popular and secluded celebrity hideaway where Hollywood A-lister George Clooney keeps a home.The migration of hundreds of people from Arab nations, Africa, and Asia was triggered following the Swiss government s decision to close its southern border with Italy.Now, waiting for smugglers to lead them into northern Europe, groups of migrants are camping out in tattered tents around the Lake Como resort.Flimsy dwellings, clothes and trash are scattered around the Northern Italian town s railway station, where dozens of new families and refugees have flocked.The migrant camp is, oddly enough, just steps away from the front door of immigration activists  George and Amal Clooney s multi-million dollar lakeside mansion in Lake Como, according to the Daily Mail.The power couple has spent some time talking about the migrant crisis. The Clooneys met privately with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in February and praised and thanked her for her leadership during the crisis.The Clooneys have taken refuge from the Hollywood spotlight in their summer home in Italy for years. Last year, Page Six reported that Clooney was mulling putting his Lake Como villa on the market due to ever-present and intrusive paparazzi.It is unclear if the recent deluge of refugees pouring into town will have an affect on Clooney s decision to sell or not.

ITS CHRISTMAS IN OCTOBER: American Debt Is $18 Trillion But Dems Want To Give Away Free Goodies For Votes,"This one sentence should scare every taxpaying American to death: I know we can afford it because we re gonna make the wealthy pay for it. - HRCLast night s debate for the candidates running for President on the Democrat side proved to be a fluff fest as if Santa himself was in the room. Free college, free this and free that Could someone please tell these people we re 18 TRILLION dollars in debt!Here s the transcript from Rush today that speaks to this Santa syndrome in the Democrat party:RUSH: First up is a montage here from the debate last night. Bernie Sanders, Hillary, Lincoln Chafee, and they re all talking about all the free stuff. College and health care and whatever you want. If you re an illegal immigrant, it s all yours. All you have to do is show up.SANDERS: Make every public college and university in this country tuition-free.HILLARY: Anyone to go to a public college or university tuition-free.SANDERS: We re all gonna have medical and family paid leave.HILLARY: Make sure every child gets health care, including undocumented children and others.CHAFEE: Funding education, funding infrastructure, funding health care.HILLARY: Enhance the benefits for the poorest recipients of Social Security.SANDERS: We should be putting money into education.

We are $18 trillion in debt. Now, you can afford anything if you ignore that, and if you don t think that s a problem and if that number is irrelevant, the money never has to even be serviced or paid back, then of course you can afford anything. But the truth is, we can t afford anything. We can afford maybe, what, what s the number that we drag in by tax revenue every year? The numbers are confusing, but $3 trillion whatever we can afford every year, but we so exceed that. We have exceeded it for so long. We re already paying for things we can t afford. And these people just want to lap more and more on top of it.Via: Rush Limbaugh",0.0
UK sets date for parliamentary showdown on crucial Brexit laws,"LONDON (Reuters) - The British government said on Thursday its key piece of Brexit legislation would be debated in parliament on Nov. 14 and 15, the next stage in what is expected to be a tortuous lawmaking process that will test Prime Minister Theresa May s authority. The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill is central to the government s plan to leave the EU in March 2019, repealing the laws that made Britain an EU member and transposing existing EU law into British law. But it has faced widespread criticism from lawmakers of all parties - including May s Conservatives - for giving the government too much power to change laws, and for not guaranteeing parliament a vote on the terms of Brexit. As a result, the bill s passage through parliament will depend on May s fragile minority government being able to pacify rebel lawmakers who said they were  deadly serious  about trying to give parliament a greater say on the terms of the EU exit. The much-anticipated first two days of debate were announced in parliament by Andrea Leadsom, leader of the lower house. Six further days of debate are planned but dates were not announced.  The bill passed its first parliamentary test in September and the next stage had been expected earlier by some lawmakers, but the government said it needed time to look over the hundreds of proposed changes which will be discussed.   Nearly 400 amendments have been tabled and we are looking at those with the utmost seriousness,  a Brexit department spokeswoman said.   We look forward to continuing the debate and working with Parliament to ensure that we deliver a functioning statute book on exit day.  Junior Brexit minister Steve Baker later warned that if the bill fails to pass through parliament in time for  Brexit day  on March 29 2019, holes would appear in the country s laws.  He also said the government currently planned separate legislation to implement the terms of the transitional agreement it is seeking to help smooth its departure from the EU, erecting another potentially difficult parliamentary hurdle. May s spokeswoman later said it was too soon to know for sure if this would be required. Among the proposed changes to the withdrawal bill, several have enough support from Conservative lawmakers to defeat May, who commands a slim 13-seat working majority in the 650-seat parliament thanks to a deal with Northern Ireland s Democratic Unionist Party. One of the potential Conservative rebels, Nicky Morgan, warned the government not to underestimate their desire to change the bill.  We are deadly serious,  Morgan, a former senior minister who was sacked by May last year, told parliament.  Any rebellion is expected to crystallise around government plans to offer lawmakers a vote on the final exit package.  The promise is not currently written into the bill, which will only allow lawmakers to accept the deal the government has negotiated with Brussels or reject it and leave the EU without a deal. Brexit minister David Davis angered parliamentarians on Wednesday by suggesting that vote could even come after Britain has left the bloc, forcing his department to issue a clarification. Called to parliament on Thursday morning to explain his words, Davis said he expected the vote to take place before December 2018 or January 2019, referring to the EU s preferred negotiating timetable. Despite his clarification, lawmakers signaled they wanted to have more say on the exit deal and would try to force the government into making concessions next month in parliament by guaranteeing in law a vote that gives lawmakers a greater say.  The sad reality is that ministerial assurances are no longer good enough,  said opposition lawmaker Stephen Kinnock. ",1.0
" While Scott Baios Battle With Erin Morans Family Continues, His Wife Defends His Size","Erin Moran s family members must have really upset former  Happy Days  star Scott Baio and his wife because now Chachi s penis size is being defended.Trump fan Scott Baio weighed in on Moran s death, saying he was  not completely shocked  by his former co-star s death and added that if  you do drugs or drink, you re gonna die. I m sorry if that s cold, but God gave you a brain, gave you the will to live and thrive and you gotta take care of yourself. However, Moran died from cancer, not drugs. And Baio s ignorance about drug addiction is stunning.So, Moran s brother Tony and her cousin, Roy, wasn t too pleased. Baio was called a  d*ck head  and  a scumbag coward piece of shit! On Facebook, Tony Moran wrote:A special shout out to Scott Baio. I already went on Twitter about you. I hope it finds you. You and my lil sis had a very very brief fling. She dumped you. 2 reasons. 1. She told me that you were more like a lil girl and not a man. 2. She told me that you were tiny. Ya know. Barely a man in the man region. True story! Scott, I d advise you to get on your knees and pray you never run into me.In what The Daily Beast notes as an  inability to know when to maintain a dignified silence,  Renee Baio came to the defense of her husband s penis size.Renee tweeted,  Why would a sister tell her brother about the size of boyfriend s manhood? Creepy at best. SB was a playboy for a reason!  We took a screenshot knowing she might delete it or lock down her account and as a surprise to no one ever, her tweets are now protected.So now Mrs. Baio is calling Erin Moran  creepy.  When her defense of Chachi s penis size is, but he  was a playboy 4 a reason,  then she is bringing his manhood into question again. Sometimes silence is the better option. Chachi never grew up and he apparently married a child. Both of them are staunch Trump supporters, by the way. Chachi loves Trump. As for Renee, the E-list celebrity s wife, she s as much of an idiot as her husband. She s taken to Facebook to launch rants in defense of her husband by using homophobic slurs against a website then declaring that Scott has  more class in his piss than all of you all.

Senate healthcare holdout Collins never got call from Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump exhorted every Republican to vote yes on a healthcare overhaul when it comes before the Senate this week, but one of his partys most vocal opponents of the bill, Senator Susan Collins, said he had made no effort to reach her. The Democrats arent giving us one vote, so we need virtually every single vote from the Republicans, not easy to do, Trump declared Monday in the White House, appearing with families he said had been harmed by Obamacare. Hours later on Capitol Hill, Collins, one of a handful of Republican holdouts and the partys most reliable moderate in the Senate, said she had not heard from Trump. Ive had conversations with Vice President (Mike) Pence, and Seema Verma, and Reince Priebus has called me a few times, to discuss the bill, but the president understandably I think is focusing on others, Collins said in an interview on Monday evening with Reuters. Verma is the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Priebus is White House chief of staff.  Asked if Trump had given up on her, Collins said: I dont know but it sounded that way from one of his press statements that I saw. He said something like - Susan Collins, shes from Maine. As if that explained it. After a mostly hands-off approach to the Senate debate on healthcare over the past few weeks, Trump urged fellow Republicans on Monday to deliver on their promise of the past seven years to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare. A defeat in the Senate would be a major setback for Trump and congressional Republicans, who view Obamacare as government intrusion in the healthcare market. Critics warn the Republican bill will deprive millions of health insurance. Collins, who voted two years ago against a repeal of Obamacare, repeated on Monday she would vote no on a motion to proceed to any of the known versions of the legislation now being circulated to repeal or overhaul the healthcare law.  The 64-year-old Maine lawmaker refused to try to predict what the outcome would be when the Senate votes on Tuesday on whether to open debate on a Republican healthcare bill. Once that episode is over, she said she hoped lawmakers would start work on a bipartisan bill on healthcare. My hope is that well end up going back to committee and doing what we should have in the first place: which is having hearings, perhaps coming up with several smaller bills to address the very real problems created by the Affordable Care Act, she said. Representatives of the Trump administration, asked whether the president intended to contact recalcitrant senators such as Collins, said others in the administration had done so.  Weve talked to virtually every single Republican senator, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price told reporters, noting that Collins had been at the White House on a number of occasions.  Collins said lawmakers would first need to address the collapse of insurance markets in many counties across the country. She said Congress should fund cost-sharing subsidies that help keep down consumers out-of-pocket costs. Collins, who said she had held individual discussions with at least eight Senate Democrats about some kind of bipartisan healthcare effort, said she believed Trump would sign a bipartisan healthcare bill. At times he called for a bipartisan bill, and so I think hed be fine with a bipartisan bill. She was forthright about her problems with the Senate Republican approach, including its sweeping cuts to Medicaid, the government healthcare program for the poor, and the expected increase in costs for older Americans who buy private health insurance. Maines population is older, mostly rural, and one-fifth of the population is on Medicaid. The median age is 43, the oldest in the country.  In northern Maine, where the (insurance) rates are highest, and the population is older, the information from what Ive seen, it (the cost of insurance) would be like a third of their income in some cases. So Im very concerned about that, Collins said. ",1.0
White House welcomes Supreme Court ruling on electricity markets rule,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Courts decision to uphold a federal rule for electricity markets that encouraged grid operators to pay large users to reduce consumption at peak times is good news for consumers and clean energy, the White House said on Monday. This decision allows us to continue realizing billions in annual savings from innovative incentives and business models that ensure we use our electricity system efficiently as we integrate more energy efficiency and renewable energy onto the power grid, White House spokesman Frank Benenati said in a statement.

Top Democrat says Trump firing of Mueller could provoke 'constitutional crisis',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, responding to escalating Republican attacks on Special Counsel Robert Mueller, said on Wednesday that if President Donald Trump fires Mueller, it has the potential to provoke a constitutional crisis. Speaking on the Senate floor, Senator Mark Warner denounced attacks on Muellers impartiality and said the special counsels investigation of ties between Trumps presidential campaign and Russia must be able to go on unimpeded. Russia denies meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and Trump has denied any collusion. While Trumps political allies have increased their criticism of Mueller, the president said on Sunday he was not considering firing him. Republican lawmakers have seized on anti-Trump texts by a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent who was involved in the Russia investigation as evidence of bias in Muellers team. Mueller removed the agent from his team after the texts came to light. Republicans on several House of Representatives committees have also announced their own probes into long-standing political grievances, including the FBIs handling of Hillary Clintons use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. Clinton, a Democrat, was Trumps opponent in last years election. Over the last several weeks, a growing chorus of irresponsible voices have called for President Trump to shut down Special Counsel Muellers investigation, said Warner, adding that the attacks were seemingly coordinated. Firing Mr. Mueller or any other of the top brass involved in this investigation would not only call into question this administrations commitment to the truth, but also to our most basic concept of rule of law, Warner said. It also has the potential to provoke a constitutional crisis. Warner called for Congress to make clear to the president that firing Mueller would have immediate and significant consequences. House Democrats had circulated rumors last week that Trump would fire Mueller this Friday, just before the Christmas holiday. Trumps White House lawyer, Ty Cobb, said in a statement on Wednesday that the administration willingly affirms yet again, as it has every day this week, there is no consideration being given to the termination of the special counsel. If the media is going to continue to ask for responses to every absurd and baseless rumor, attention-seeking partisans will continue to spread them, Cobb added. ",1.0
Zimbabwe cabinet pick to show if Mnangagwa is breaking with the past,"HARARE (Reuters) - New Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa is expected to form a new cabinet this week, with all eyes on whether he breaks with the past and names a broad-based government or selects old guard figures from Robert Mugabe s era. Of particular interest is his choice of finance minister to replace Ignatius Chombo, who was among members of a group allied to Mugabe and his wife, Grace, who were detained and expelled from the ruling party. Chombo is facing corruption charges and is due to appear in court for a bail hearing on Monday. In a tentative sign that he might do things differently, ZANU-PF cut the budget for a special congress to be held next month and also slashed the duration by half from six days, the state-owned Herald newspaper reported on Monday. Mnangagwa was sworn in as president last Friday after 93-year-old Mugabe quit under pressure from the military.  He vowed to rebuild Zimbabwe s ravaged economy and serve all citizens. But behind the rhetoric, some Zimbabweans wonder whether a man who loyally served Mugabe for decades can bring change to a ruling establishment accused of systematic human rights abuses and disastrous economic policies.   The composition of the new government will show a clear path whether we continue with the status quo or the clear break with the past that we need to build a sustainable state. It s a simple choice,  said former finance minister and opposition leader Tendai Biti. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change has called for an inclusive  transitional authority  to mark a break with Mugabe s 37-year rule and enact reforms to allow for credible and free elections due next year.  Zimbabwe needs all hands on deck...We cannot continue reproducing these cycles of instability,  Biti, who earned international respect as finance minister in a 2009-2013 unity government, told Reuters. Some economic and political analysts say Mnangagwa s choices may be limited after Cyber Security Minister and close ally Patrick Chinamasa said last week he saw no need for a coalition, as ZANU-PF had a parliamentary majority.  And with Mnangagwa saying on Friday elections would go ahead next year as scheduled, the opposition would have little to gain from participating in a coalition just eight months before the vote, Professor Anthony Hawkins, a business studies professor, said.  If I were an opposition politician I would say: what s in it for me? Unless I m convinced I m going to lose the election, I won t participate,  Hawkins told Reuters.   He (Mnangagwa) might introduce technocrats from commerce and that will send out a signal of sorts... As far as the international community is concerned legitimacy is important. It s a very delicate situation and he has very little room for maneuver.  The Standard newspaper, which has been critical of Mugabe and his government over the years, said Mnangagwa would be judged on how he delivers on the bold commitments he made at his inauguration. It said he must  walk the talk on graft  that has exacerbated the country s economic decline. Mugabe s fall after 37 years in power was spurred by a battle to succeed him that pitted Mnangagwa, his former deputy who had stood by him for 52 years, and Mugabe s wife, Grace, 52, who has been at the couple s  Blue House  mansion in Harare and hasn t been seen in public since.

"One dead, scores arrested in unrest over delayed Honduran vote count","TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - At least one protester died, over 20 people were injured and more than 100 others were arrested for looting in Honduras after a delayed and disputed presidential vote count sparked unrest amid opposition accusations of electoral fraud. Honduras was due to publish the final result of last Sunday s presidential election at 9 p.m. local time (0300 GMT) on Friday, the electoral tribunal said, but opposition complaints about the count appeared set to impede that.  Election results initially favored opposition candidate and TV star Salvador Nasralla by five points with more than half the votes counted. They then swung in favor of U.S.-backed center-right President Juan Orlando Hernandez after the count came to a halt on Monday and resumed over a day later, sparking protests. The tribunal has said it will hand-count some 1,031 outstanding ballot boxes with irregularities - or nearly 6 percent of the total - after the count halted with Hernandez ahead by less than 50,000 votes, or about 1.5 percentage points. However, Nasralla s center-left alliance has called for votes to be recounted in three of Honduras  18 departments, or regions, and refused to recognize the tribunal s special count until its demands for a wider review were met.  If Juan Orlando wins, we re ready to accept that, but we know that wasn t the case, we know that Salvador won and that s why they re refusing the transparency demands,  said Marlon Ochoa, campaign manager of Nasralla s alliance. International concern has grown about the electoral crisis in the poor Central American country, which struggles with violent drug gangs and one of the world s highest murder rates. Police sources said at least one man had been shot and killed at a protest in the city of La Ceiba, while about 12 members of the military and police force had been injured in demonstrations that snarled traffic outside Honduras  main port on Friday and around the country. At least 10 protesters were injured in the capital of Tegucigalpa, according to the city s Hospital Escuela. Military officials called for peaceful protests after police reports of looting in the capital and other cities. In the country s second-biggest city of San Pedro Sula, thick plumes of black smoke clouded the air as protesters burned tires and police tried to disperse the crowds with tear gas. More than 100 people were also arrested on suspicion of looting in San Pedro Sula on Friday, a police spokesman said, and local media carried footage of shops being plundered. People flocked to supermarkets on Friday, stocking up on food and provisions as major roads and supply routes were blocked across the country by angry protesters. Lines appeared outside gas stations and cash machines. Banks clogged up with people wanting to withdraw or deposit money.  I m filling the tank with gas in case anything happens, the situation looks bad and there are protests all over the city,  said Carlos Valle, a 61-year-old pensioner, as he joined a long line of vehicles waiting at a fuel pump in Tegucigalpa. Both Hernandez and Nasralla, a television game show host allied with leftists, claimed victory after the election, and the challenger has said he will not accept the tribunal s result because of doubts over the counting process. Leading a center-left alliance, the 64-year-old Nasralla is one of Honduras  best-known faces and backed by former President Manuel Zelaya, a leftist ousted in a coup in 2009. Zelaya weighed into the debate on Thursday in a letter in which he accused the tribunal of  electoral crimes  on behalf of Hernandez, who himself was standing for re-election enabled by a contentious 2015 Supreme Court ruling. One of the four magistrates on the electoral tribunal on Thursday flagged  serious doubts  about the counting process.  The Organization of American States (OAS) on Wednesday convinced both candidates to vow to respect the final result once disputed votes had been checked. But a few hours later Nasralla rejected the OAS accord, saying his opponents were trying to rob him. He urged supporters to take to the streets in protest. ",1.0
"Trump releases some JFK files, blocks others under pressure","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday ordered the unveiling of 2,800 documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy but yielded to pressure from the FBI and CIA to block the release of other records to be reviewed further.  Congress had ordered in 1992 that all remaining sealed files pertaining to the investigation into Kennedys death should be fully opened to the public through the National Archives in 25 years, by Oct. 26, 2017, except for those the president authorized for further withholding. Trump had confirmed on Saturday that he would allow for the release of the final batch of once-classified records, amounting to tens of thousands of pages, subject to the receipt of further information. But as the deadline neared, the administration decided at the last minute to stagger the final release over the next 180 days while government agencies studied whether any documents should stay sealed or redacted. The law allows the president to keep material under wraps if it is determined that harm to intelligence operations, national defense, law enforcement or the conduct of foreign relations would outweigh the publics interest in full disclosure. More than 2,800 uncensored documents were posted immediately to the National Archives website on Thursday evening - a staggering, disparate cache that news outlets began poring through seeking new insights into a tragedy that has been endlessly dissected for decades by investigators, scholars and conspiracy theorists. The rest will be released on a rolling basis, with redactions in only the rarest of circumstances, by the end of the review on April 26, 2018, the White House said in a statement. In a memo to government agency heads, Trump said the American people deserved as much access as possible to the records. Therefore, I am ordering today that the veil finally be lifted, he wrote, adding that he had no choice but to accept the requested redactions for now.  A Central Intelligence Agency spokesman told Reuters that every single one of approximately 18,000 remaining CIA records in the collection would ultimately be released, with just 1 percent of the material left redacted. CIA Director Mike Pompeo was a lead advocate in arguing to the White House for keeping some materials secret, one senior administration official said. While Kennedy was killed over half a century ago, the document file included material from investigations during the 1970s through the 1990s. Intelligence and law enforcement officials argued their release could thus put at risk some more recent law enforcement equities and other materials that still have relevance, the official said. Trump was resistant but acceded to it with deep insistence that this stuff is going to be reviewed and released in the next six months, the official added. Academics who have studied Kennedys slaying on Nov. 22, 1963, said they expected nothing in the final batch of files would alter the official conclusion of investigators that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin who fired on the presidents open limousine that day in Dallas from an upper window of the Texas Book Depository building overlooking the motorcade route. They likewise anticipated that the latest releases would do little to quell long-held conspiracy theories that the 46-year-old Democratic presidents killing was organized by the Mafia, by Cuba, or a cabal of rogue agents. Of the roughly 5 million pages of JFK assassination-related records held by the National Archives, 88 percent have been available to the public without restriction since the late 1990s, and 11 percent more have been released with sensitive portions redacted. Only about 1 percent have remain withheld in full, according to the National Archives. Thousands of books, articles, TV shows and films have explored the idea that Kennedys assassination was the result of an elaborate conspiracy. None have produced conclusive proof that Oswald, who was fatally shot by a nightclub owner two days after killing Kennedy, worked with anyone else, although they retain a powerful cultural currency. My students are really skeptical that Oswald was the lone assassin, said Patrick Maney, a professor of history at Boston College. Its hard to get our minds around this, that someone like a loner, a loser, could on his own have murdered Kennedy and changed the course of world history. But thats where the evidence is. Kennedys assassination was the first in a string of politically motivated killings, including those of his brother Robert F. Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., that stunned the United States during the turbulent 1960s. He remains one of the most admired U.S. presidents. ",1.0
"After Africa trip, France's Macron breaks 50 percent popularity rating","PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron s popularity rose above 50 percent for the first time since he was elected in May with people approving of the way he defends the country s interests abroad, a poll showed on Tuesday. The poll, conducted by Ifop-Fiducial for Paris Match magazine, saw the head of state s popularity jump 6 percent compared to the same survey in November.  It comes after Macron undertook a three-day tour to Africa promising a break from the past. During the trip, he was praised for his direct approach with students at a university in Burkina Faso.  The French appreciate his way of making contact with people and to speak openly even if he didn t announce anything,  said IFOP s deputy chief Frederic Dabi. Seventy-three percent of the 978 people surveyed said Macron defended the country s interests well, a 5 percent rise from November. The jump in popularity also comes at a time when the French right is more fractured than at almost any point in the modern-day Fifth Republic, leaving opposition to Macron negligible. On the negative side, 57 percent of people said they believed that Macron was not in tune with the concerns of the French. The poll, carried out between December 1-2, said that some 42 percent of people saw the far-left Insoumise party as the main opposition to Macron compared to just 22 percent for the conservative The Republicans and 21 percent for the far-right National Front.

North Korean defector pushes diplomatic solution in U.S. Congress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A rare high-level defector from North Korea told U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday that disseminating more information in the reclusive country would ultimately be more effective than the billions of dollars being spent to address the military threat. We can educate (the) North Korean population to stand up by disseminating outside information, Thae Yong-ho, chief of mission at Pyongyangs embassy in Britain until he defected in 2016, said during an appearance at Congress two days before President Donald Trumps first trip to Asia since taking office. Asked what kind of information he was discussing, Thae said background about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, like his birth date, to convey the idea that he and his family are not gods. He said South Korean videos, for example were increasingly available within the North.  The U.S. is spending billions of dollars to cope with the military threat and yet how much does the U.S. spend each year on information activities involving North Korea in a year? Unfortunately, it may be a tiny fraction, he said. Thae made his first visit to Washington during rising international tensions over North Koreas nuclear and ballistic missiles program. The crisis is expected to dominate Trumps trip to the region, which includes a stop in South Korea. Thae also told the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee that U.S. officials should meet with Kim at least once to try to understand his thinking and convince him that he is risking mass destruction. Thae said Kim thinks he can force the United States to accept North Korea as a nuclear power and drive U.S. forces off the Korean peninsula. Reuters reported on Tuesday that Washington was quietly pursuing direct diplomacy with North Korea, despite Trumps public assertion that such talks are a waste of time. Amid a war of words between Kim, who has called Trump a mentally deranged dotard, and Trump, who referred to Kim as little rocket man, many U.S. lawmakers have been pushing for non-military solutions to the crisis. Representative Ed Royce, the committees Republican chairman, called at the hearing for a dramatic increase in the number of individuals and entities targeted for sanctions, without delay. Thae is the highest-level defector from North Korea in two decades. In emotional testimony, he described a life before he left for South Korea that mixed relative privilege and oppression. He said he defected because he could not let his sons lead a life, like me, as a modern-day slave. ",1.0
Very Fake News CNN PRESIDENT Like Oz Behind The CurtainFeeds Anti-Trump Questions To Anchors While Interviewing Guests On Live TV [VIDEO],"CNN s President Jeff Zucker has dictated questions that are unfavorable of President Donald Trump to his anchors while they are live on set, according to reports.There have been several instances in which Zucker took the reigns, according to the Hollywood Reporter and the Daily Caller.During a 25 minute long debate between CNN anchor Jake Tapper and White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway on Feb. 7, Zucker called the control room to tell them to ignore commercial breaks. He was telling my executive producer,  Keep going!'  Tapper said.Tapper and CNN s Wolf Blitzer were recapping Trump s Feb. 16 conference when they interviewed Jeff Lord, a former CNN contributor and Trump supporter. During the interview, Lord said that Trump was  relaxed  and  on point  during the press conference. Moments later Zucker called Tapper through a direct line and had him pose a question. What about the 57 percent of people who didn t vote for him? Doesn t he have to be their president, too?  Sucker said. (WATCH below starting at the 3:10 mark.)Within moments, Tapper asked Lord the question structured around what Zucker wanted.As the debate continued, Lord pointed out that Trump asking Urban Radio Networks  African-American reporter April Ryan to set up the meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus is proof that Trump was appealing to the African-American base.Zucker picked up the phone again, and had the anchors ask another question. Then why does he have to ask April Ryan to get a meeting?  Zucker said. (Watch at around the 9:15 mark.)Watch one of the most smug interviews by two liberal CNN puppets you have ever seen. Knowing that their boss Jeff Zucker was feeding these two stooges questions makes it even more embarrassing. It s like watching a real-life puppet show: Zucker and Trump have known each other since before Zucker approved  The Apprentice  in 2004. Sucker told New York Magazine in October that Trump s attacks on his network made him  sad. The Washington Free Beacon",0.0
U.S. recovers Hellfire air-to-ground missile from Cuba,"WASHINGTON/HAVANA (Reuters) - The United States has recovered an inert Hellfire air-to-ground missile that had mistakenly ended up in Cuba, U.S. and Cuban officials said on Saturday. The laser-guided AGM 114 Hellfire mistakenly arrived in Cuba in June 2014 and was retrieved on Saturday by U.S. officials and representatives of Lockheed Martin Corp, the missiles owner, the Cuban foreign ministry said in a statement. We can say, without speaking to specifics, that the inert training missile has been returned with the cooperation of the Cuban government, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement. Lockheed Martin spokesman Bill Phelps declined comment. The missile had been sent to Europe for a training exercise in 2014 but somehow ended up in Cuba in an embarrassing loss of military technology, the Wall Street Journal reported last month. The department is restricted under federal law and regulations from commenting on specific defense trade licensing cases and compliance matters, so we cannot provide further details, Toner said. But he said reestablished diplomatic relations between the two countries have helped the U.S. engage with the Cuban government on issues of mutualinterest. Cuba said the missile arrived by mistake or mishandling on a commercial flight from Paris and was not listed on the cargo manifest, and that it was discovered by customs inspectors. Once the U.S. government officially informed the Cuban government that a training missile belonging to the company Lockheed Martin was mistakenly sent to our country and expressed its interest in recovering it, Cuba communicated the decision to hand it over and started arrangements for its return, the Cuban statement said, without revealing when the United States made the request. A team of U.S. government and Lockheed Martin experts took the missile back to the United States on Saturday, Cuba said. ",1.0
DETROIT SCHOOLS CHIEF Wants To Shut Down Charter Schools Ranked Best In The State To Focus On Public Schools Ranked Worst Urban School District In Country,"Liberal logic 101 The new superintendent for Detroit s public schools said he will recommend the school district no longer authorize charter schools and focus instead on improving its conventional schools, according to the Detroit Free Press. We have to get it right with traditional public schools and our focus, our energy, our resources need to be on that,  Superintendent Nikolai Vitti told the Free Press.Hechinger Report   Since 1994, there has been an extreme decline in Detroit Public Schools  enrollment: 73 percent. This has had a huge impact on the financial stability of the district and the performance of its remaining schools. However, the expansion of charter schools is just one reason for the decline in enrollment. During that same time, the overall population in the city declined by 33 percent. In addition, the district lost a considerable number of students to inter-district choice programs with neighboring school districts, which enroll more students statewide than charter schools.ForTheRecord says: Two charter schools authorized by Detroit s public schools were rated as the best in the state, according to a report card published by the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. The report card examined Michigan s middle and elementary schools and adjusted their rankings to reflect the impact of students  economic background.Detroit s Martin Luther King Jr. Education Center Academy was the top rated elementary and middle school in the state. Ross/Hill Academy was the second-best.Ironically, Detroit s public schools have been rated as the worst large urban school district in the country. In 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2015, the National Assessment of Education Progress did assessments and Detroit was rated as the worst in each time.Washington Examiner   According to a highly regarded study, in just one year Michigan charter school students earn an additional two months of learning gains over their traditional public school counterparts. For Detroit, charter students get an additional three months of learning in math and reading when compared to their traditional school peers.Most Michigan charter schools are authorized by state universities, and most conventional public school districts do not authorize any charters. Detroit is an exception, having authorized 14 charters.  Michigan Capitol Confidential",0.0
Clinton says Russian intelligence services hacked DNC,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said Russian intelligence services hacked into Democratic National Committee computers and she accused Republican contender Donald Trump of showing support for Russian President Vladimir Putin. We know that Russian intelligence services hacked into the DNC and we know that they arranged for a lot of those emails to be released and we know that Donald Trump has shown a very troubling willingness to back up Putin, to support Putin, Clinton said in an interview with Fox News Sunday. The United States has not publicly accused Russia of being behind the hack of Democratic Party computers. Cyber security experts and U.S. officials, however, said they believed Russia engineered the release of the emails to influence the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Asked if she believed Putin wanted Trump to win the White House, Clinton said she was not going to jump to that conclusion. But I think laying out the facts raises serious issues about Russian interference in our elections, in our democracy, Clinton told Fox in the interview, taped Saturday. The United States would not tolerate that from any other country, especially one considered an adversary, she said. For Trump to both encourage that and to praise Putin  despite what appears to be a deliberate effort to try to affect the election I think raises national security issues, she said. The New York businessman has praised Putin, saying he was a stronger leader than U.S. President Barack Obama, a Democrat. Trump last week invited Russia to dig up tens of thousands of missing emails from Clintons time at the U.S. State Department. Russia, if youre listening, I hope youre able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, Trump told reporters. The Republican presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election later said he was being sarcastic in his comments, which raised concerns among intelligence experts and criticism that  Trump was urging a foreign government to spy on Americans.

 Watch The Liberal Redneck Compare Anti-Trans Protesters To Michele Bachmann On Bath Salts,"Trae Crowder, known on YouTube as  The Liberal Redneck,  has returned again with yet another damned funny commentary on the recent creepy obsession that Republicans have with what people do in public restrooms.Crowder started by taking aim specifically at the new wave of idiots that are invading Target department stores, in order to loudly  protest  the fact they allow transgender people to use the restrooms in their department stores. One case in particular was one where a woman was walking up and down the aisles in target, towing along what appeared to be half of her 12 children she claimed to have.Sympathizing with the woman, in the comedic sense, he said he could understand how with 12 kids she was  crazier than Michelle Bachmann on bath salts.  You gotta agree with his logic. With 12 kids, and having to manage them in a militant Christian household that you KNOW she runs, she s probably crazier than an outhouse rat.Crowder is sick of hearing about how Republicans are going to  take their country back  as well, and suggested that they all move somewhere that religion and government are the same   like Saudi Arabia. Crowder said I know what you re thinking    Eww, they re brown, gross. But check it out: they love screaming, they hate books, they throw rocks at queers   you d fit right in.  What a great point. Right?Watch Trae completely own every person who can t stop thinking about people peeing below:Considering how many Republicans get caught doing bad hings in public rest rooms, you would think that they d be focusing more on their own party, instead of an entire segment of society that already lives in such fear of going to the bathroom they are in-and-out while drawing as little attention to themselves as possible.Featured image via video screen capture ",0.0
"Venezuela opposition refuses swearing in, small protest breaks out","CARACAS/PUERTO ORDAZ, Venezuela (Reuters) - Venezuela s opposition refused on Wednesday to swear in newly-elected governors before a pro-government legislative superbody it deems unconstitutional, as a small protest broke out in southern Bolivar state over fraud allegations. The pro-government electoral council announced in the middle of the night that the ruling socialists had won the Bolivar governorship, meaning President Nicolas Maduro s government took 18 of 23 states in Sunday s vote. Polls had put the opposition far ahead, and anti-Maduro politicians have alleged a litany of dirty tricks including switching electoral centers to dangerous areas at the eleventh hour and gross abuse of state resources.  However, they have failed to give evidence of ballot-tampering, and some opposition candidates have conceded they lost due to high abstention in their demoralized ranks.  Still, the disparate opposition coalition said its five winning candidates would not be sworn in by the controversial legislative superbody known as the Constituent Assembly.   The governors-elect will only be sworn in as established in the constitution and the laws of the Republic,  the Democratic Unity coalition said in a statement on Wednesday. Leftist Maduro has previously said that governors not sworn in by the pro-government legislative body will not be allowed to take their posts in a country reeling from widespread food and medicine shortages, a collapsing currency and soaring inflation.  He described Venezuela s electoral system as the world s most secure and slammed U.S. President Donald Trump and other foreign leaders who questioned the veracity of the vote. Bolivar became a flashpoint after the electoral council briefly showed the opposition winning on its web site Sunday night before proclaiming the Socialist Party candidate as winner in the early hours of Wednesday.  Opposition candidate Andres Velasquez accused the electoral council of invalidating some ballots cast for him.  Pockets of his supporters protested outside the electoral board s offices in state capital Ciudad Bolivar, with some clashes breaking out on Monday and Tuesday. Some 50 people rallied on Wednesday, though the protest quickly fizzled.   I am going to demonstrate to the world that this electoral process is fraudulent,  Velasquez told local radio in Bolivar, home to many of Venezuela s gold and diamond mines. However, nationwide protest like those that rocked Venezuela for four months earlier this year are not expected, given fatigue and disappointment among demonstrators. The perennially divided opposition is in disarray after Sunday s election, with some leaders calling fraud and others conceding defeat, often in uncoordinated press statements.  Sunday s election has left the socialists more confident of winning a presidential vote expected in late 2018.  ",1.0
BREAKING: Whos Laughing Now? House GOP Members Introduce Resolution To Impeach IRS Commissioner,"Does this mean Republicans in the House are FINALLY going to start standing up for the Americans who elected them to be their representatives in Washington DC? Does this action represent the change we re all desperate to see now that Boehner is vacating his seat? House Republicans on Tuesday introduced a resolution to impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, accusing him of making  false statements  under oath and failing to comply with a subpoena for evidence.In case you ve forgotten, here are two of the most powerful testimonies exposing the tyranny of our government  we have ever posted on our website:Our friend Becky Gerritson (who is currently running for a seat in our US Congress):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE4_MT8MkIAAnd then there was the powerful testimony by Founder and Chairman of True the Vote, Catherine Engelbrecht:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db21AQu30XwHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and 18 other committee members introduced the resolution to begin impeachment proceedings. In doing so, they followed through on a threat first made over the summer, when Republicans accused the IRS leader of making inaccurate statements to Congress regarding the Tea Party targeting scandal and its aftermath. Commissioner Koskinen violated the public trust,  Chaffetz said in a statement Tuesday.  He failed to comply with a congressionally issued subpoena, documents were destroyed on his watch, and the public was consistently misled. Impeachment is the appropriate tool to restore public confidence in the IRS and to protect the institutional interests of Congress. The IRS issued a statement later Thursday saying,  The IRS vigorously disputes the allegations in the resolution. We have fully cooperated with all of the investigations. The announcement of the impeachment resolution comes on the same day Koskinen testified before the Senate Finance Committee, and after the Justice Department on Friday decided to close its investigation of the targeting scandal without pursuing criminal charges.

"U.N. ban on North Korean textiles will disrupt industry and ordinary lives, experts say","BEIJING/CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Nations sanctions on North Korea s important textiles industry are expected to disrupt a business largely based in China and pose compliance headaches for clothing retailers in the United States and around the world.  The U.N. security Council imposed a ban on North Korea textile exports and a ceiling on the country s imports of crude oil on Monday, ratcheting up sanctions designed to pressure North Korea into talks about its nuclear weapons and missile programs.      Retailers in the United States and other countries have intentionally limited their exposure to North Korea in recent years, as tensions over the country s nuclear program have increased. The industry has sought to strengthen control over its supply chain since a textile factory collapse in Bangladesh killed more than 1,100 people in 2013.  Larger retailers, such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), have the ability to keep North Korea-produced goods out of their stores. But smaller brands may face enforcement challenges, said Marc Wulfraat, president of supply chain consulting firm MWPVL International.  There are still hundreds and thousands of companies that are sourcing from overseas that don t have the wherewithal or the resources or people or money to chase after these issues,  Wulfraat said. Textiles were North Korea s second-biggest export after coal and other minerals in 2016, totaling $752 million, according to data from the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency. Nearly 80 percent went to China. Enforcement of the textile ban along North Korea s 1,400-km (870-mile) border with China - where goods are sometimes smuggled across, often on boats at night - could be challenging, North Korea experts say.   In the past, we have seen shows of quite convincing enforcement in the major centers, such as at Dandong,  said Chris Green, a North Korea expert at Leiden University in the Netherlands, referring to the largest trading hub on the China-North Korea border. Goods still slip through in less visible areas, he said.  Trade in non-banned goods, including food and other daily necessities, continues between China and North Korea.  Enforcement will depend a lot on China,  said Paul Tjia, an outsourcing specialist who regularly visits North Korea.  So far, a lot of the North Korean textiles trade to Europe and other places goes via China.   It will be up to Chinese companies that deal in the North Korean textile trade to take action and up to the Chinese government to ensure the Chinese companies are taking action.  On a recent visit to the Chinese border with North Korea, several Chinese traders told Reuters the Chinese government is strictly enforcing U.N. sanctions to the point that some businesses that rely on trade with North Korea have already gone bankrupt or traders have had to start trading in non-sanctioned goods.  Another challenge is that clothes can be partly made in China and partly in North Korea with a  Made in China  label attached to the finished product.  Even if a label says  Made in China,  some parts of the product are allowed to be made in North Korea and other places,  Tjia said.  For example, the buttons may come from Italy, the cotton may come from Australia or India, the labor may come from North Korea or China, the accessories may come from Bangladesh.    A spokeswoman for Target Corp (TGT.N) said the company has taken steps to keep even unfinished goods from North Korea out of its supply chain.   We re aware of the accusations and have clear guidelines and standards in place for our vendors and suppliers,  said spokeswoman Jenna Rack.  We don t source any products from North Korea or any apparel products from Dandong.  North Korea does not release statistics on the number of people involved in the textiles industry, but experts estimate  at least 100,000 people are employed at North Korean textiles factories, producing goods both for export and the domestic market.  Cheng Xiaohe, a North Korea specialist at Beijing s Renmin University, estimates the figure may be as high as 200,000 people.  Wages at textiles factories grew tenfold around 2010 when North Korea was experimenting with economic reforms, according to Green, so people suddenly went from earning 30 North Korean won to 300 won.  They were suddenly getting a reasonable wage,  said Green. Supply chain consultant Tjia said North Korea textile workers will be hit by the trade ban.  If the goal of the sanctions is to create difficulties for ordinary workers and their ability to make a livelihood, then a ban on textiles will work,  he said. ",1.0

 Trump Just Got One Of His Victims RELATIVES To Stab Her In The Back And Twist,"Donald Trump s damage control regarding his penchant for sexually assaulting women is reaching ever-darker corners of evilness. One of his accusers, Summer Zervos, who was a contestant on  The Apprentice  in 2006, and is a restaurant owner, is now being called a vindictive liar for coming forward about her experience with Trump.By her own first cousin, John Barry.According to Zervos, Trump got very physical with her: He put me in an embrace and I tried to push him away. I pushed his chest to put space between us and I said,  Come on man, get real.  He repeated my words back to me,  Get real,  as he began thrusting his genitals. Trump, of course, denies this and has dug up Barry to issue a statement that is absolutely vile   and is just another reason why so many of his victims stayed silent. This is Barry s full statement: I am completely shocked and bewildered by my cousin, Summer Zervos, and her press conference today. Ever since she was on The Apprentice she has had nothing but glowing things to say about Mr. Trump. For almost a decade, my cousin would talk about how much she looked up to Mr. Trump and viewed him as an inspiration   a success story she wanted to copy. Summer would also talk about how kind and caring Mr. Trump was on the show, and how he would even visit children in hospitals without telling the press. She has praised the good things he s done for her life, and in fact she converted her friends and our family to become Trump supporters even though we ve never been active in politics before.That was until Summer invited Mr. Trump to her restaurant during the primary and he said no. I think Summer wishes she could still be on reality TV, and in an effort to get that back she s saying all of these negative things about Mr. Trump. That s not how she talked about him before. I can only imagine that Summer s actions today are nothing more than an attempt to regain the spotlight at Mr. Trump s expense, and I don t think it reflects well. In a nutshell, Barry alleges that Zervos praised Trump and spoke glowingly of him for years, which obviously means she s lying now. The fact that Trump turned down an invitation of hers just further proves that she s out for revenge, and was never assaulted.There s even an email below Barry s statement that must, obviously, be rock-solid proof that Zervos is lying through her teeth.Right.Because that s always the way it goes. It doesn t even occur to Barry or anyone who believes him that she might have behaved that way out of fear that Trump would ruin her if she did anything. Trump is rich, powerful, impossibly vengeful, and has resources she can t even begin to dream of.In fact, fear of retaliation is one of the primary reasons sexual assault victims stay silent. Does anybody really believe that she could take on a man like Donald Trump, and actually come out of it in one piece? Other than misogynistic jerkwads who think women are to blame for rape culture because they stay silent?Trump and his brainwashed puddles of rotting pig vomit believe that all of this is just too coincidental   that all these women are ganging up on him specifically to derail his campaign. He s creating bizarre theories of a global conspiracy against him, orchestrated by the Clintons, and carried out by multiple institutions with whom he has a gripe.The truth is that he s a sad, paranoid, disgusting excuse of a pig who preys on women because he thinks they re only around to help him get his rocks off.Photo of Summer Zervos by Frederick M.

White House to request $29 billion for hurricane relief,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is preparing a $29 billion disaster aid request to send to the U.S. Congress after hurricanes hit Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida, a White House official said on Tuesday. The request is expected to come on Wednesday. It will combine nearly $13 billion in new relief for hurricane victims with $16 billion for the government-backed flood insurance program, the White House official told Reuters. The White House wants Congress to forgive $16 billion of the debt that the National Flood Insurance Program, which insures about 5 million homes and businesses, has racked up. The request comes as the program is close to running out of money, congressional aides said. The program had racked up nearly $25 billion in debt before this season s major hurricanes. The Trump administration is also proposing more than a dozen reforms including new means testing and an extreme-loss repetition provision, aides said. Some homes insured under the program have gotten payments repeatedly from the program after multiple storms. The flood insurance money is aimed primarily for areas impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which struck Texas and Florida, aides said. Congressional aides say the National Flood Insurance Program is expected to run out of money the week of Oct. 23. The $12.77 billion in hurricane aid is expected to last through the end of the calendar year, administration officials said. They said earlier this week the government had about $10 billion on hand for disaster relief. The Trump administration is also seeking $576.5 million for wildfire suppression funding. Aides said the administration will acknowledge the need for a long-term fire borrowing fix and forestry management reforms, congressional aides said. ",1.0
"OHIO ST UNIV TERRORIST Abdul Razak Ali Artan Played Victim In Recent Interview, Criticized College For Not Having Muslim Prayer Rooms On Campus","Abdul Razak Ali Artan, a Somalian refugee came to the US in 2014, and he is already a US Citizen. How does a Muslim refugee from Somalia become a US citizen so quickly? While others wait in line for years, refugees who come to the US through the State Dept. sponsored Refugee Resettlement program are given, food stamps, free health-care, free education, housing, a monthly stipend, in many cases, they are given free furniture, and best of all, they are fast-tracked to US citizenship. What was it that Trump was criticized about again? Wasn t it something about how we needed to stop the flow of Muslim refugees into America until we can find a better way to vet them? I m pretty sure most of the students on the OSU campus are rethinking their opposition to Trump s plan after today (at least those who were mowed down by his vehicle or stabbed by the butcher knife he was wielding during his planned attack). Authorities had previously confirmed that the suspect was a Somali refugee, legally residing in Ohio.Artan fled Somalia with his family in 2007 before landing in Pakistan.He moved to the United States in 2014, where he was granted legal, permanent status.It should be noted that Ohio State s online directory only lists one student with the name, Abdul Artan.Furthermore,  The Lantern    OSU s campus newspaper   ran an interview with Artan just a few months ago, in which he criticized the school for not having Muslim prayer rooms on campus. I wanted to pray in the open, but I was kind of scared with everything going on in the media,  he stated.  I m a Muslim, it s not what the media portrays me to be. I don t blame them,  he continued.  It s the media that put that picture in their heads so they re just going to have it, and it s going to make them feel uncomfortable. Authorities maintain that the attack was  done on purpose  and are treating the incident as a possible terrorist act.   DCMedia would like us to believe they are unsure of the motive behind his attack. ",0.0

"Zero Knowledge Systems Not Hostile to Data Privacy, says Snowden","21st Century Wire says It s been almost two years since the cloud storage provider Dropbox appointed former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to its board.

A divided Republican party: Donald or Ivanka for president?," CLEVELAND/NEW YORK (Reuters) - At times, the speech was drowned out by the cheering crowds in the arena of the Republican National Convention. Social media crowned a new political star. Some Republicans said they were seeing the U.S. president they longed for.  It was Ivanka Trumps night.  The eldest daughter of New York businessman-turned-presidential nominee Donald Trump almost stole the show on Thursday night with a speech about her father that roused a packed Cleveland convention hall, broadcast to millions.  READ OUR TOP STORIES: Verizon emerges as front-runner in Yahoo auction OPINION - Dumb money:How political mega-donors got it wrong Silicon Valley leads avalanche of quarterly reports On Google, there were more searches for Ivanka Trump than for her father.  The 34-year old businesswoman and former model talked about her fathers yearning to improve America, childcare, equal pay for women and other issues close to her heart, with a poise some found befitting of the White House.  Okay, why isnt @IvankaTrump running for President? television actor Anson Mount said in a Twitter post.  One of the best speeches - if not the best speech - tonight, said Chris Herrod, a 50-year-old delegate from Utah who had worked for Trumps vanquished rival Ted Cruz, the U.S. senator from Texas.  One of Trumps five children, Ivanka was chosen to introduce her father, who then officially accepted the Republican Partys presidential nomination. Since Trump announced his intention to run for the White House last year, she has been steadily drawn into her fathers presidential campaign along with her 35-year-old husband Jared Kushner.  The couple both take part in the Trump campaigns family meeting each Monday morning, helping make decisions about spending and strategy, according to a source familiar with the meetings.  Among the children, Ivanka is the one who is often the bridge to women voters and seems to have the mission of selling her fathers softer side. When she is not involved in the campaign, she helps to run the familys sprawling business empire from its New York City headquarters.  This week in Cleveland she has been everywhere, lobbying for her father with delegates and donors, appearing in television interviews and leaving a trail of picture-taking fans in her wake. One man, a Republican delegate in Cleveland, carried a placard all week around the convention that read: Ivanka, 2024. First Female President.  Her star turn in Cleveland was one of the top trending topics on Twitter late on Thursday, with about 121 tweets mentioning her name posted every minute. Overall sentiment on her was more positive than negative by a ratio of 3 to 1, according to analytics firm Zoomph.  Ivanka missed her one chance to date to vote for her father: she had not changed her party registration from Democrat to Republican in time to cast a ballot in the April 19 New York primary election.  She more than compensated on Thursday night, some convention delegates said.  She gave us enormous insight into him and the kind of man he is, said retiree Fernando C. deBaca, a 78-year-old New Mexico delegate. Shes (an) enormously capable young lady, as is her brother. Were going to see the beginning of a dynasty here.  ",1.0
 Watch A 12-Year-Old Scientist OBLITERATE Anti-Vaxxers Lies In 2 Minutes Flat (VIDEO),"A 12-year-old boy has just gone viral for absolutely shredding every anti-vaxxer s argument against vaccinating children.The boy, who goes by the name Marco Arturo, is a science-loving video blogger who uses his Facebook page to share his findings and ignite discussions related to science. His latest video was a major hit, and has left the young boy shocked that his 2-minute video has been seen by more people than the population of Bahamas, Belize, Greenland, Monaco, Bermuda and Dominica combined.  His educational message to anti-vaxxers has been viewed millions of times, and when you watch it, you will understand why.Marco begins the video addressing two major concerns being proposed by anti-vaxxers: that vaccines are to blame for autism, and that they re part of a government conspiracy. Marco says: We ve all been lied to by doctors and pharmaceutical companies about vaccines. After a lot of research I realized that vaccines do and will cause autism. At first it sounds like Marco is taking their side, but if anti-vaxxers thought they d just found their youngest recruit, they re dead wrong. Seconds later, Marco holds up a folder labeled Evidence that vaccines cause autism, stating that he will explain his findings  page by page.  By now, anti-vaxxers are probably salivating all over themselves, eager to hear the scientific proof that their ridiculous theories are correct. However, when Marco opens the folder, all of the pages are blank. Marco explains: I think it might be because there is absolutely no evidence to support the statement that vaccines are linked to autism in any way whatsoever. To make anti-vaxxers even more furious that they d been tricked so expertly, Marco stresses how important vaccines are, and what they re REALLY responsible for: saving the lives of millions of children. Marco closes by begging parents to get their children vaccinated, and reiterates that there is no evidence that can link vaccines to autism.In closing, Marco notices that one of the pages actually DOES have something on it, which might get gullible anti-vaxxers  hopes up once again. The page says one word:  MIC,  and Marco drops it.Here s Marco s brilliant video:Featured image via screenshot",0.0
 White Police Officer Fired After Threatening Black Child On Facebook (VIDEO),"Just before midnight on Friday, July 8, LaNaydra Williams discovered a chilling comment on her Facebook page. The words were posted beneath a photo of Williams, who is Black, posing together with her five-year-old daughter.The comment read: We ll see how much her life matters soon   better be careful leaving your info in the open where she can be found. Hold her close tonight, it ll be the last time. Williams, who lives in Texas, had never seen or spoken to the poster, identified on Facebook as Rodney Lee.She went to his Facebook page, and immediately saw pictures of a man wearing a police uniform. She contacted authorities immediately.The officer who left the message on her daughter s picture was identified as Rodney Lee Wilson. Until Sunday, Wilson was an officer working for the Overland Park Police Department, in Kansas.Williams says that Overland Park officials initially claimed Wilson s Facebook page was hacked.On Sunday, however, following an internal investigation, Oakland Park police acknowledged that Wilson did leave the threatening comments on Williams  photo.Overland Park Police Chief, Francis Donchez Jr, issued an official statement regarding the incident, on July 10.A post on the Overland Park Police Department s Facebook page reads: This morning, the Overland Park Police Department received notification about a Facebook post, reportedly made by one of our officers  from his personal Facebook account. I immediately initiated an investigation into the officer s actions and requested it be completed in a timely manner,  said Police Chief Francis Donchez Jr. During the investigation, by our Professional Standards Unit, we learned our officer did in fact make this post,  Donchez said.  It was obvious that our officer did not meet the standards of professionalism for the Overland Park Police Department. Overland Park has terminated the officer, effective immediately. The official post goes on to say: A criminal investigation is underway as a result of information discovered during the course of the personnel investigation. During an interview with Fox 4, Williams said she remains very fearful of the former-officer.

Freeport Indonesia shuts main supply route to mine after shooting,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - The Indonesian unit of Freeport-McMoRan Inc has temporarily shut the main supply route to its Papua mine after a shooting incident, a spokesman said, amid escalating tensions between security forces and an armed rebel group in the area.  No one had been reported hurt after shots were fired at a vehicle, but the main supply route to the world s second-biggest copper mine had been temporarily closed while the security situation was assessed, Freeport Indonesia spokesman Riza Pratama said in text message. Authorities in Indonesia s eastern province of Papua are delivering food and aid to villages near the mine where security forces say the rebel group has blocked residents  movement, as security personnel surround the area, a police official said. Police say a group linked to the Free Papua Movement (OPM) is preventing about 1,000 people from leaving five villages near the Grasberg mine operated by the U.S. company.   We continue to try a persuasive approach and dialogue,  said Viktor Mackbon, police chief of the Mimika area, where the villages are located. Talks with the group would be conducted through public and religious figures in the region, he added. Officials on Saturday said about 200 police and military personnel had been deployed in preparation to secure the area by force, if necessary. Police sad they will distribute on Monday a notice in the area for the  armed criminal group  to give themselves up and surrender weapons. Reuters could not immediately reach members of the rebel group, the West Papua National Liberation Army (TPN-OPM), to seek comment. On Friday, the group denied occupying villages near the mine, but said it was  at war  with the police, military, and Freeport.   A resident from one of the villages, Banti, said security forces had blocked access to the village. Residents he had spoken were not being held hostage by separatists but  are only worried about what might happen if the police and military come into their area , he said. A state of emergency has been declared in the area and  security stepped up after a string of shootings since Aug. 17 that killed one police officer and wounded six.      Papua has had a long-running, and sometimes violent, separatist movement since it was incorporated into Indonesia after a widely criticised U.N.-backed referendum in 1969.     The incident is the first escalation of violence under President Joko Widodo, who has sought to ease tension in the region by stepping up investment, freeing political prisoners and tackling human rights concerns.      The Grasberg mine has been dogged by security concerns for decades. From 2009-2015 shootings within the mine project area killed 20 people and wounded 59. ",1.0
Taking back control: UK's classic blue-and-gold passport to return,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday hailed the return of Britain s classic blue passport as a benefit of leaving the EU, pleasing Brexit campaigners for whom it is a symbol of national sovereignty but attracting derision from many remainers. The government said a version of the old passport, issued to Britons from 1920 to 1988, when it was replaced by the burgundy jacket of the European Union, will be reintroduced after the country leaves the bloc in March 2019.    The UK passport is an expression of our independence and sovereignty - symbolizing our citizenship of a proud, great nation,  May said on Twitter.  That s why we have announced that the iconic blue passport will return after we leave the European Union in 2019.    During often bitter campaigning for the June 2016 referendum on whether to leave the EU, which Britain joined in 1973, some Brexit supporters seized on the color of the passport as a symbol of the country s lost independence.  Opponents meanwhile mocked their attachment to something superficial while arguing that Brexit would diminish Britain s real standing in the world. Former United Kingdom Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, a leading supporter of Brexit, responded to Friday s news by tweeting:  Happy Brexmas!   A return to British passports means we are becoming a proper country again,  he wrote.  We are getting our individuality and national identity back.  But Anna Soubry, a lawmaker from May s Conservative party who opposes Brexit, tweeted:  Stand by for street parties as blue passports return. Not sure they ll make up for broken #Leave promise of extra  350m a week for (British public health service) NHS.   A Brexit campaign slogan suggesting that Britain s financial contributions to the EU could be diverted to the National Health Service has been credited with swinging voters toward  Leave .  The new document, which will be issued from October 2019, will come with enhanced security features, immigration minister Brandon Lewis said, and will be introduced as old passports expire and at no extra cost to the taxpayer. Speaking to the BBC, Lewis said even people who voted remain still had an attachment to the dark blue passport. Responses to May s tweet were overwhelmingly negative, however, with many Twitter users pointing out that Britain could have kept the old color under EU rules.  Others bemoaned the fact that Britons would lose the right to live and work in 27 other EU countries as a result of Brexit.  Wow this passport s fancy. Must have some kickass features,  read one tweet accompanied by a picture of a smiling family collecting their new passports.  How many countries do you have the right to work in on this bad boy?   One   Huh. Still, blue though...   ",1.0
BUSTED! WASHINGTON POST Skips Maxine Waters Admission Of No Guilt Found In Trump/Russia Collusion [Podcast],"There are 20 Democrats who at certain times have called for Comey to be fired but all you hear this morning is that the firing was done by Trump to stop the Russia investigation. The hypocrisy is HUGE!These people are desperately trying to keep this ball moving down the field. The problem is that there is no  there  there in the Trump/Russia investigation.Even Maxine Waters said the Russia investigation has nothing on Trump:There is probably no one in Congress more openly opposed to President Donald Trump than Maxine Waters. We have already seen that she has called for Trump s impeachment. Therefore when even Waters states there is not yet any evidence at this time of Trump-Russia collusion, that is certainly significant. That is why it is astonishing that Washington Post opinion writer Jonathan Capehart left that significant admission made during his own podcast off his May 9 column about it.First let us listen to the segment of Capehart s podcast in which Waters made her surprising admission:How convenient for the left-leaning publication to leave out a direct statement by Maxine Waters. By the way, the title of the article is a rip roaring race baiting title:Maxine Waters: Jeff Sessions believes  it s his job to keep minorities in their place Who does this in 2017? Jeff Sessions is such a good man who DOES NOT deserve such a nasty comment from Congresswoman Waters. Shame on her and shame on Capehart for making this comment the title!JONATHAN CAPEHART: I ve got to ask you, because you leveled a whole lot of accusations out there about collusions and hacking and all of that. Have you seen anything, either through the intelligence briefings, anything to back up any of the accusations that you ve made?MAXINE WATERS: First of all, don t forget that all of our intelligence agencies say, yes, they have the documentation that they did the hacking on the DNC and on some of us.CAPEHART: But the collusion, though?WATERS: No, we have not. That s why investigations are so important, to drill down and to connect those dots and to get the facts. What we have is a lot of smoke that causes us to want to know more about what has happened. Why is it there are so many people around him are connected to oil? Why is it that Michael Flynn, who evidently has a great relationship with Putin, who has received payments for so-called speeches and who s spent a lot of time in Russia and was accused of talking about sanctions, he lied about it and he got caught?In his column writeup about his podcast interview with Maxine Waters, Capehart tossed that admission of no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion down the memory hole.",0.0

"Advocates hail U.S. court abortion decision, predict national impact","NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Abortion rights advocates on Monday cheered a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that struck down restrictions to abortion access in Texas, calling it a major victory for women and predicting similar laws are now endangered nationwide. The high court ruled 5-3 that a Texas law imposing strict regulations on abortion doctors and facilities put an undue burden on women exercising their right to abortion, which has been legal in the United States since 1973. Laws such as the Texas regulations are seen by critics as a backdoor way of restricting abortion access. Hardest hit are rural, poor women for whom distance and cost put abortions out of reach, they say. The Texas law required abortion doctors to have admitting privileges, a formal affiliation that can be hard to obtain, at a hospital within 30 miles (50 km), and required clinics to have costly, hospital-grade facilities such as specified corridor width, floor tiles, parking spaces and elevator size. With todays Supreme Court ruling, I let out a big exhale, said Tracy Droz Tragos, director of Abortion: Stories Women Tell, to be released in August by HBO Documentary Films. At least for a moment, I am optimistic about the future of women in America. Women have had their constitutional rights vindicated, said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights which represented the Texas clinics, in a statement. The Supreme Court sent a loud and clear message that politicians cannot use deceptive means to shut down abortion clinics, she said. Texas claimed its law protected womens health, but critics said the regulations were medically unnecessary and intended to shut down clinics. Writing the Supreme Court decision, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote: We conclude that neither of these provisions offers medical benefits sufficient to justify the burdens upon access that each imposes. Each places a substantial obstacle in the path of women, he wrote. Decrying the decision, anti-abortion groups such as the Susan B. Anthony List said Texas women will be unprotected from dangerous and unsanitary conditions. The abortion industry cannot be trusted to regulate itself and they know it, said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the List, which supports anti-abortion political candidates. Making a similar argument, Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, in a statement said abortion providers prey on the vulnerabilities of women who are in desperate situations, placing their bottom line over the health and safety of the patients. And the U.S. Supreme Court, in efforts to put the so-called right to abortion above everything else, just let them get away with it, she said. Since the restrictive law was passed in 2013, the number of abortion clinics in Texas, a state of 27 million people, dropped to 19 from 41. Today is a great day for women, said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, in a statement. The Supreme Court has powerfully reaffirmed a womans constitutional right to make her own decisions about her health, family, and future, no matter her zip code, she said. Similar laws are likely to be struck down, experts said, in states with restrictions such as requiring women to make repeated visits or requiring ultrasounds for women seeking abortions and that the images be shown to them. Weve known for a long time that the purpose of these laws is to prevent women from having abortions, said reproductive rights attorney Kathryn Kolbert, who argued a major abortion case before the high court in 1992. It may not be the death blow, but it certainly makes it more difficult to put forward these types of laws with a straight face, she said. Documentary filmmaker Dawn Porter, who made a film about abortion providers in Texas and elsewhere in Trapped that was released this year, said she was elated. If theres any silver lining in Texas making such an egregiously unconstitutional law, its that I think people have woken up and people are thinking you cant taking any rights for granted, she said. You cannot sleep on your rights. ",1.0

 Trump FURIOUS After New Poll DEVASTATES His Campaign,"NBC News third post-leaked audio, post-second debate poll shows something quite shocking (but not really): Hillary Clinton is gaining an insurmountable lead over Donald Trump, with just three weeks left to go until election day.The new poll, conducted October 10 through the 13th, with 1,000 respondents, shows Clinton with an 11-point lead, 48 to 37 percent over Trump. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, has seven percent in support and Green Party candidate Jill Stein has 2 percent.In a head-to-head matchup, Clinton maintains a 10 point lead, 51-41, with 10 percent undecided.As NBC News put it:To put Clinton s current 11-point lead into perspective, Barack Obama beat John McCain by seven points nationally in 2008. And Obama s margin of victory over Mitt Romney in 2012 was four points.Both pollsters who coordinated with NBC News, Democrat Fred Yang and Republican Bill McInturff, both came to the conclusion that Trump does not have a chance of winning the presidency.One of the biggest contributing factors to Clinton s lead in her 20 point advantage with women (55-35 percent), her 60 point advantage with non-white voters (76-16 percent), and her gain among men in which she s behind by just three points, 48-45 percent.The poll als0 shows President Obama s approval rating at 53 percent, a positive for Clinton heading into the final stretch of the election.Now that the polls have shown a consistent lead for Clinton, Trump has no other way to legitimize his failing, pathetic campaign than to claim it s going to be  rigged  against them thanks to minority communities, dead people, a globalist conspiracy.Now that InfoWars has overtaken his campaign, the public has been turned off and are showing that they are ready for Hillary.Nate Silver s FiveThirtyEight currently gives Clinton an 86 percent chance of winning the election and Trump a 14 percent chance. This marks the 10th day that Clinton has been in the high 80s, the same place she was at after the Democratic National Convention.Trump has a lot of ground came to catch up on. Can he do it in three weeks? Who knows, but it s not looking good for him.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",0.0
 FL Cops Face Prison After Brutally Beating Unarmed Man (VIDEO),"On Tuesday, a federal Grand Jury announced the indictment of former Marion County, Florida deputy Jesse Terrell. The charges stem from Terrell s involvement in the brutal beating of Derrick Price, a 44-year-old Black man, who was assaulted by a gang of white cops, in August of 2014.Video of the attack was published by WESH on January 27.The video shows that Price was initially trying to run from the police, who were pursuing in a black SUV.About ten seconds into the video, however, Price stops running and throws his hands into the air. He then drops to his knees, before laying facedown on the pavement.At this time the group of officers can be seen rushing at Price from several directions. The five cops immediately begin kicking, punching and otherwise assaulting him, as he continues to lay on the ground.Although it s clear from the video that Price was not resisting, the officers can be heard shouting over and over  Stop resisting,  as they continue to deliver blows to his head and body.At least one of the officers was wearing a body camera at the time of the assault. It appears that the cop s camera was purposely angled so that it would not capture video of the attack. It was later turned off.Watch the video below, courtesy of WESH.The other four officers involved in the beating all plead guilty to violating Price s civil rights.According to the Tampa Bay Times: Former deputies Cody Hoppel and Adam Ray Crawford admitted to beating Price, while two others, Trevor Wade Fitzgerald and James Louis Amidei, admitted they failed to intervene.Crawford also admitted to obstruction of justice, and Hoppel admitted to punching another man and lying about it in an unrelated case.The four acknowledged in court records that Price was not resisting arrest when beaten. Those deputies, who all resigned, are scheduled to be sentenced by Senior U.S. District Judge William Terrell Hodges in Ocala on April 20. The five former police officers are each facing up to ten years in prison, along with fines of as much as $250,000.*Featured image credit: video screen capture WESH",0.0

FBI probes possible U.S. ties to corruption by former Ukraine president: CNN,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI and U.S. Justice Department are investigating possible U.S. ties to alleged corruption involving the former president of Ukraine, including the work of firms headed by political operatives Paul Manafort and Tony Podesta, CNN reported on Friday, citing multiple U.S. law enforcement officials. The broad-based investigation was looking into whether U.S. companies and the financial system were used to enable corruption by the party of former pro-Russian Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, CNN said. A person who answered a telephone number for Manafort said Manafort was not available for comment. The person, who said he was an associate of Manafort and who gave his name only as David, referred queries to a lawyer in Washington, who did not immediately respond to a phone call and an email. In response to a report in the New York Times on Monday, Manafort denied any impropriety in a statement. I have never received a single off-the-books cash payment as falsely reported by The New York Times, nor have I ever done work for the governments of Ukraine or Russia, he said. The New York Times reported that he had received cash payments worth more than $12 million over five years that were itemized on secret ledgers belonging to Yanukovichs Party of Regions. Manafort, who resigned as chairman of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps campaign on Friday, had not been the focus of the probe, CNN said, citing the officials. The probe was looking at the work of other firms linked to the former Ukrainian government, including the Podesta Group, a lobbying and public relations company headed by Tony Podesta, whose brother John Podesta is chairman of the campaign to elect Democratic Party presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Manaforts attorney Richard Hibey did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FBI declined to comment, CNN reported. The Podesta Group has hired an independent legal firm to investigate whether it had been misled by the Centre for a Modern Ukraine, a not-for-profit group linked to the ousted Ukrainian government, a spokeswoman for the group said in a statement. The Justice Department, asked to comment on the report, said it remained committed to helping recover stolen assets on behalf of the people of Ukraine.  Investigators in Ukraine have said Yanukovych and his party engaged in widespread corruption. He fled to Russia following a popular uprising in 2014. ",1.0
Puerto Rico rescue plan strains U.S. Republican caucus,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leading Republicans on Tuesday outlined a plan to help Puerto Rico shed crippling debt and accused investor-allied groups of misleading lawmakers about the proposal. The rescue would steer creditors and holders of Puerto Rico bonds toward a new, independent board that would seek a fair way to write down an estimated $70 billion in debt. Banks, mutual funds, hedge funds and Puerto Rico citizens all hold paper issued by 18 entities on the U.S. commonwealth and many of those investors, if not all, would face a loss. Lawmakers in Congress are being lobbied - and attacked - by investor groups that are trying to protect their bottom lines. They are deceitful, said Rep. Rob Bishop, a Utah Republican who leads the House Natural Resources Committee. Bishop said accusations likening the Puerto Rico rescue plan to a government bailout were crap, and the plan had the virtue of protecting taxpayers and not spending government money. The rescue plan does, however, adopt some principles of bankruptcy law and that makes it controversial. Investors could be forced into a settlement over the objections of holdout bondholders under certain circumstances, according to a draft of the bill. Some lawmakers said allowing Puerto Rico to modify its bonds could mean chaos for municipal markets. If they can do it for Puerto Rico, they can do it for every other state, Rep. Tom McClintock said of the damage that the rescue bill would do. McClintock, a California Republican, said he was very concerned about the plan after a half-hour meeting Tuesday afternoon of Republicans on the Natural Resources panel. House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement that he supported Bishops effort because it holds the right people accountable for the crisis (and) shrinks the size of government. Ryan also said he liked the idea of an independent board settling investor disputes, adding that legislation passed last week to halt payments on Puerto Ricos debt was troubling. The Republican Study Committee, a group of conservative lawmakers, said in a statement it was still reviewing the bill, but we are encouraged that there appear to be some improvements. Ryan will need the votes of many fiscally-conservative Republicans - and as is seen likely, some Democrats - if he is to get the rescue package through the House of Representatives. The plan will face a test on Wednesday when the Natural Resources panel begins to amend the plan during a law-writing session known as a mark up. An aide to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said her office was still reviewing the legislation. ",1.0
Puerto Rico debt bill cleared for Thursday U.S. House vote,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Legislation helping Puerto Rico dig out of its $70 billion debt crisis is set for a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday after a House panel fended off attempts to open the bill to a series of controversial amendments. By voice vote on Wednesday, the Rules Committee, the gatekeeper for bills moving through the House, sent the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) to the full House for debate and a likely vote on Thursday. The legislation, the result of months of negotiations between Congress and the Obama administration, would create a federal oversight board to work with investors to determine how much they would recover of the island territorys $70 billion in loans. Republicans have stressed that no taxpayer money would be used to bail out Puerto Rico from a crisis that has left nearly half of the population in poverty amid closings of schools and hospitals and a contracting economy. During a Rules panel debate that stretched into the night, the committee rejected pleas to allow amendments that would have changed the basic structure of the legislation and the operation of the oversight board. If the bill passes the House, action would move to the Senate, where some leading Democrats have said they would seek significant changes. Earlier on Wednesday, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop, who ushered the bill through his committee on May 25, told reporters he expected the full House to pass it on Thursday. Bishop, a Utah Republican, said a strong vote for passage in the House would help propel it through the Senate. The bottom line is the better the vote here (in the House), the less likely its going to come back in a significantly altered form from the Senate, Bishop said. Supporters hope to get it enacted into law before July 1, when Puerto Rico faces a deadline for making a $1.9 billion debt payment that it might not be able to fulfill. The House Rules Committee voted to allow debate on a limited number of amendments, including one giving priority to protecting federal taxpayer investments in Puerto Rico, such as mass transportation assets. Another amendment expected to be debated would expand a federal program aimed at encouraging economic development in Puerto Ricos under-utilized business zones. Representative Raul Grijalva, a senior Democrat who worked on the bill, said Puerto Ricos debt crisis, if unaddressed, could grow into a humanitarian crisis. Stabilization measures contained in the bill, he said, would be the first step toward getting the situation under control. But his fellow Democrat, Puerto Rican-born Representative Luis Gutierrez, warned, I dont think many of my colleagues in this body appreciate just how deeply offensive the bill before us is regarded in Puerto Rico. He was particularly concerned with the way control board members would be chosen, with most not having to have any ties to the island. But Gutierrez failed to convince the committee to allow amendments to be offered making changes to the board and its operations. ",1.0
" For Bannon, The Losses Just Keep Coming","Steve Bannon is portrayed as the Grim Reaper on Saturday Night Live. There is a  President Steve Bannon  meme out there from coverage of the controversial advisor. In reality, his influence seems to be headed nowhere but down. First, he totally blew President Donald Trump s health care initiative. Then, his influence waned further when he openly seemed to fight with son-in-law Jared Kushner and urged the president to not take action in Syria. Now, Trump has even backpedaled on this demands that Congress fund the wall between the United States and Mexico, against the wishes of Steve Bannon.The border wall with Mexico was a big part of the Trump campaign. All of his rallies included a session of chanting with the audience of  Build the Wall!  For his part, Trump never acknowledged that Mexico is never going to pay for this expensive wall. It is also part of Bannon s dreams for the United States. His worldview, which was front and center during the president s Inaugural Address, needs this wall.Bannon is so enamored by the wall that he was pushing for a government shutdown to get Congress to include funding for it. Clearly, he learned nothing from the healthcare debacle where he told Trump to try to strong arm Congress into passing their bill because Trump wanted them to. Bannon s lack of experience dealing with our legislative branch is clear. As a co-equal branch of government, its members are never going to do something just because the White House tells them to. If you are thinking Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) pushed through Neil Goresuch s nomination because of this kind of work, you miss the win it gave McConnell.This week, Bannon told his supporters,  This is a stand worth taking. We re drawing a line in the sand. It looks more and more like Bannon is going to be alone drawing that line as if you didn t think his days in the West Wing were numbered before, it is more than clear that they are now.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images.",0.0
"Tillerson to discuss North Korea crisis, trade in China","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will visit China this week for talks that will include the crisis over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs and trade, the State Department said on Tuesday. Tillerson s trip, from Sept. 28 to 30, will also lay the groundwork for President Donald Trump s visit to China in November, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said. Tillerson s visit comes at a time of high tension between the United States and North Korea, China s neighbor and ally, which is working to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. President Donald Trump warned North Korea on Tuesday that any U.S. military option against North Korea would be  devastating  for Pyongyang, but said the use of force was not Washington s first option. China has urged a return to dialogue. Nauert called China s steps to implement tougher U.N. sanctions on North Korea after its recent missile and nuclear tests  significant.   We have a good relationship with China,  she told a regular news briefing, adding that this was evidenced by what would be Tillerson s second visit to China in nine months in office.   China has taken enormous steps in the right direction. There is always more that countries can do, but at this point we want to thank China for the steps it has taken in the right direction.  In Beijing on Wednesday, asked for details of Tillerson s visit, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regular news briefing only that he would meet China s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. While backing U.N. sanctions, China, North Korea s main trading partner, opposes unilateral U.S. steps and has been worried Washington might move to freeze its banks out of the global financial system unless they cut ties to Pyongyang. On Tuesday, the U.S. Treasury announced sanctions against 26 more individuals as part of its non-proliferation designations for North Korea, as well as nine North Korean banks, including some with ties to China. Tillerson s visit to Beijing follows one by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who said on Monday China needed to guarantee fair and reciprocal treatment for U.S. firms, as he tried to strike an upbeat tone amid bilateral trade tension. China-U.S. ties have been strained by Trump s criticism of China s trade practices and by demands that Beijing do more on  North Korea. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump met for the first time at Trump s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in April. Trump has since played up his personal relationship with Xi, even while criticizing China over North Korea and trade. In August, Trump authorized an inquiry into China s alleged theft of intellectual property - his first direct trade measure against Beijing, a move China called  irresponsible.  ",1.0
 Republican West Virginia Lawmaker Wants You To Know His N***** Tweet Wasnt Racist (VIDEO),"Whenever Republicans dredge up a certain specious  quote  from former President Lyndon Johnson about  n*ggers,  I am reminded of my grandmother.My grandmother didn t like black people much at all. Living next door to her and conversing regularly, I heard more slurs than one would typically hear at a Tea Party convention devoted to discourse on race relations. In fact, when a Republican says that  blacks are the real racists  or tells us what he or she thinks about  negroes,  it reminds me of my childhood   and not in a good way.Apart from that, she was a sweet, kind woman who genuinely cared about others   enough so that her personal prejudices rarely (if ever) impacted her interactions with others. My mother, though her demeanor has changed over time, was also not too fond of African-Americans when I was younger. When I was 15 or 16, I was dating an African-American girl. She was intelligent, caring, and probably one of the better people I have had the pleasure to know. However, her skin was darker, so my mother disapproved heavily.After meeting the girl, we ll call her Samantha, once, my mom knew what she had to do to protect her son from the risk of race-mixing (which, at the time, she was against,  for the good of the child ). I was not permitted to leave the vicinity of my house because I might visit her. I was not allowed to go out with friends because she might meet me wherever I wanted to go at any given time. I was a prisoner.Despite my grandmother s pretty open racism, she had a huge problem with my mother s actions. While she personally had a low opinion of people because of their skin color, she also recognized one great truth: It doesn t matter how she or anyone else feels, because everyone deserves to be treated equally. After learning of my mother s decision to effectively imprison me around my home because disagreed with the skin color rather than the character of the person I was dating, my grandmother pulled me aside and said something that was equally heartwarming and offensive to me: I want you to know that no matter what your mother says, there is nothing wrong with you dating that n*gger girl. She s nice and sweet. You tell me any time you want to see her and I ll make it happen because it ain t right that your mom won t let you be with who you want. And so it went for months. Any time my parents left the house, my grandmother would take me to pick Samantha, and she would go over an  escape plan  if they returned home prematurely. Despite her prejudices, she was always kind to Samantha. In fact, those interactions changed her opinions somewhat. She stopped being a  n*gger.  She became a person in my grandmother s eyes. She became human. Actually getting to know someone can have that impact. At first, she was  one of the good ones,  but eventually race stopped being a factor altogether as my grandmother learned that people are just people, regardless of skin color.People could offer a number of defenses for how she felt the majority of her life:  she was a product of her time  or  she didn t know any better.  I won t do that. At any point in our nation s history, there has been someone strong enough to fight for what is right, to take a stand against such horrific classifications of people. My grandmother was not one of them, but despite this she was also outspoken about equal rights (though a slur was usually included in the discussion). She genuinely believed that her own prejudices (which she admitted even early on  might be wrong ) should have no bearing on how society as a whole treats people   just like Lyndon Johnson.At first glance, Johnson would fit right in at a Trump rally. In April 2014, MSNBC s Adam Serwer noted that the former President was  practically a connoisseur  of the n-word. There is absolutely no question that Johnson was a massive racist, but he was also a huge proponent of the Civil Rights Act, which he lovingly called the  n*gger bill.  Serwer writes:Then in 1957, Johnson would help get the  nigger bill  passed, known to most as the Civil Rights Act of 1957. With the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the segregationists would go to their graves knowing the cause they d given their lives to had been betrayed, Frank Underwood style, by a man they believed to be one of their own. When Caro asked segregationist Georgia Democrat Herman Talmadge how he felt when Johnson, signing the Civil Rights Act, said we shall overcome,  Talmadge said  sick. The Civil Rights Act made it possible for Johnson to smash Jim Crow. The Voting Rights Act made the U.S. government accountable to its black citizens and a true democracy for the first time. Johnson lifted racist immigration restrictions designed to preserve a white majority   and by extension white supremacy. He forced FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, then more concerned with  communists  and civil rights activists, to turn his attention to crushing the Ku Klux Klan. Though the Fair Housing Act never fulfilled its promise to end residential segregation, it was another part of a massive effort to live up to the ideals America s founders only halfheartedly believed in   a record surpassed only by Abraham Lincoln.Ihle is under fire for jumping on the opportunity to use the word  n*gger  in a context he assumed was safe.The remark was in response to a thread about food stamps   the sort of  free stuff  the right often claims Democrats use to get black votes. The implication, of course, is that black people only want  free stuff.  While Ihle used the quote in furtherance of racist bullsh*t, something we can expect from pretty much any Republican at any time, he defends his uncensored use of the n-word, claiming the tweet is being is taken out of context (you know, just like he used the quote without providing context). That kind of racism needs to be rooted out of society and shining a light on it is an effective way to do so,  Ihle told WCHS. He says that he was simply stating a  historical truth  and that he will not be taking the tweet down. He did not address the fact that there is little evidence that Johnson even said the words he quoted.While Ihle doesn t see a problem with his  n*gger  tweet, pretty much everyone else does:    Johnson was a racist, but he was a racist (just like my grandmother) who believed society s attitudes, including his own, needed to change. Johnson recognized that he irrationally hated the very same people whose rights he fought for.  It is not just Negroes but all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry,  he said of the plight of African-Americans. Undoubtedly, he included himself in that assessment.The first step toward change is self-awareness. Johnson knew enough to know he was a racist   something of which Ihle seems incapable.Watch him defend his remarks below:Featured image via screen grab",0.0
" OOPS: Trumps Voter Fraud Panel BACKFIRES On Him, Wants To Investigate Russian Meddling In 2016 Election","Well, that has to be embarrassing.Ever since Election Day, Trump has insisted that he won the popular vote despite the fact that Hillary Clinton actually won it by nearly 3 million votes.According to Trump, Hillary only won it because of  voter fraud,  accusing nearly three million people of voting illegally.In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016Losing the popular vote has been a sore spot for Trump as his fragile ego just can t handle rejection.And so, Trump decided to create a panel to investigate.I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017As you may also recall, Trump has repeatedly refused to create a panel to investigate the Russian interference in the election that helped him win.Well, that s about to change.According to the Boston Globe, two members of the panel are calling for looking at Russian hacking of voting systems in more than two dozen states, a departure from what Trump intended the panel to investigate.New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner and Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap have requested that the panel look at Russian interference, which Trump has repeatedly claimed never happened despite evidence to the contrary. There s stuff coming out now that states were hacked in this election,  Gardner said. If you are looking at the integrity of the election, you have to look at things that might compromise that integrity,  Dunlap added.  That includes things that might happen electronically. And Kansas Secretary of State and Trump ally Kris Kobach agrees with them. In the initial descriptions of the commission, election security and the integrity of equipment and voter databases was not specifically described,  Kobach said.  But if it s something the commission wants to discuss, we can. In short, Trump s own  voter fraud  panel is going to take a look at Russian interference in the 2016 Election, which is probably the last thing Trump wanted them to investigate. But the problem with investigating the  voter fraud  that Trump claims cost him the popular vote is that instances of voter fraud are negligible. Even Republican state officials have criticized Trump for making such an outrageous claim. So it s likely the panel simply didn t have much to do because voter fraud is so rare in our country. Now they are going to investigate real voter fraud and Trump must be terrified because he slipped up on Thursday morning by admitting that Russia did interfere, only he also attempted to blame it on President Obama.By the way, if Russia was working so hard on the 2016 Election, it all took place during the Obama Admin. Why didn t they stop them?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 22, 2017So not only is Congress and special prosecutor Robert Mueller investigating, Trump s own panel is investigating now. The only walls Trump is seeing right now are the ones closing in on him and his treachery.Featured Image: Jason Kempin and Sean Gallup/Getty Images",0.0
France and Qatar sign deals worth 12 billion euros: Macron,"QATAR (Reuters) - France and Qatar signed commercial contracts worth around 12 billion euros  ($14.15 billion) on Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron said, adding that the deals underscored the close relationship between the two countries. Qatar has agreed to buy 12 more Rafale fighter planes from Dassault Aviation, will employ France s Suez to dredge and clean Qatar s lagoon and has retained France s RATP and SNCF to build and operate a metro system in Qatar.

 WATCH: The View Rips Trump For Not Having The Balls To Apologize For His Sexism,"Donald Trump is in deep sh*t because he refuses to apologize for sexist remarks he made about a Miss Universe contestant.During the presidential debate on Monday night, the Republican nominee took serious flack for fat-shaming Miss Universe contestant Alicia Machado just because she didn t conform to Trump s beauty standards for women.Hillary Clinton took Trump to task, informing him that Machado has a name and is going to vote in this election as are millions of other women across the country who also don t appreciate how he has treated women.On Tuesday, after Trump continued to insult Machado on Fox & Friends, the ladies of The View discussed his remarks and refusal to apologize, and even conservative panelist Jedediah Bila was disgusted by his behavior. Now this guy doesn t know how to apologize it seems, because this happened a long time ago and everybody has a past and all of us have said things that maybe we sit and say  I regret it,  the Fox host began.  It s seems though he doesn t regret it, because the comment here, the only acceptable remark is,  You know what? That was a long time ago when I was a different man and I m sorry. I m deeply sorry that I said those things. But Trump didn t apologize just like he has never apologized for any of the offensive remarks he has made over the years. He couldn t even apologize for his birtherism. That shows character, there s a character flaw here,  Bila declared before slamming Trump s supporters for blaming everyone around Trump instead of holding Trump responsible for his own personal words and actions.  And everybody wants to blame his handlers and say,  Why isn t he being told,  and I say, you know what, you re a grown man running for president, you re responsible for what you said, and you re responsible for owning up. And I don t care who your handlers are   grow up and say,  I m sorry. Joy Behar also summed up Trump s message.  The message is  don t vote for me,  she said.Here s the video via ABC.Donald Trump is not presidential material. He has no courage and zero moral fiber. He thinks he can say whatever he wants without consequence and while that may be the case on a reality show this is the political arena he is in now. Women represent more than half of the electorate, which makes pissing them off a very bad idea if the GOP hopes to stave off extinction. But his big mouth could have even more serious repercussions.If Trump pops off at the wrong time to the wrong people he could seriously affect our relations with other nations, especially nations with which we have serious tensions to work out. Trump s big mouth could easily sabotage crucial diplomatic negotiations or piss someone off enough to break ties with us. We need international cooperation now more than ever, especially if we hope to defeat ISIS. Insulting countries we need will not help us.And since he can t even treat most people in this country with respect, how can we really expect him to actually respect other nations?Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",0.0

 Veterans Send Loser Trump A Brutal Message: Keep Your Donations (TWEETS),"On Tuesday, Republican front-runner Donald Trump shocked everyone by announcing that he was boycotting the Fox News GOP debate on Thursday, as it was being moderated by his nemesis, Megyn Kelly. And in his childish haste to get back at Fox News for giving Kelly another chance to make him look like an idiot, Trump sent the network a message of blatant disrespect: he would be throwing a competing event: a benefit for America s veterans on the very same day as the GOP debate.On Trump s event page for veterans and wounded warriors, the front-runner promised to raise money for the men and women who have been treated so horribly by our all-talk, no-action politicians . Well, it turns out that veterans have a message for Trump: We don t want your donations.On Wednesday, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America founder Paul Rieckhoff announced that his organization would not accept any contributions that came from Trump s event. He tweeted:TwitterTwo other veterans  groups have also decided they want nothing to do with Trump s publicity stunt. The Wounded Warrior Project, which has recently come under fire for using its donation money for wasteful purposes, has denied having any awareness of Trump s efforts to fundraise for the organization. VoteVets.org, however, was willing to send a more direct message to the GOPer. The organization, which boasts that it is America s largest progressive veterans group, issued a statement that said  Don t hide from Megyn Kelly behind us.  Iraq War veteran and chairman of the organization absolutely burned The Donald: Let me put this in language Donald Trump understands. You re a loser. You re a third-rate politician, who clearly doesn t understand issues, and is so scared of Megyn Kelly exposing it, that you re looking to use veterans to protect you from facing her questions. The veterans  scorn is honestly well-deserved   a look into Trump s past can easily prove that this is just a stunt for Trump and there s no sincerity in his charity event.

VALERIE JARRETT JUST MOVED INTO Barack And Michelle Obamas DC HomePlans To Help OUST TrumpERIC HOLDER WARNS: Its comingHes comingHes ready to roll,"Barack Obama is turning his new home in the posh Kalorama section of the nation s capital   just two miles away from the White House   into the nerve center of the mounting insurgency against his successor, President Donald J. Trump.Obama s goal, according to a close family friend, is to oust Trump from the presidency either by forcing his resignation or through his impeachment.And Obama is being aided in his political crusade by his longtime consigliere, Valerie Jarrett, who has moved into the 8,200-square-foot, $5.3-million Kaloroma mansion with the former president and Michelle Obama, long time best friends.Jarrett played a vital   if at times low-key   role in the Obama presidency. She lived in the White House, dined with the Obamas, and help shape his domestic and foreign policies.The former president has set up an office on the West End of the national s capitol, where he recently hosted an open house for his White House staff   including Joe Biden, Susan Rice, Josh Earnest and Jarrett.But the office, part of his post presidency perks, cannot be used for political purposes. The rent on his home is paid by him personally.On Tuesday, former Attorney General Eric Holder revealed that Obama is indeed getting closer to making his public reappearance in politics. It s coming. He s coming,  Holder said speaking to reporters.  And he s ready to roll. According to the family source, Obama was at first reluctant to assume the role of leader of the opposition. No longer the most powerful man in the world, he was just observing Trump and not liking what he saw,  said the source. He was weary and burned out after eight years in office. But Valerie convinced him that he didn t have any choice if he wanted to save his legacy. And, as usual, he bowed to Valerie s political wisdom and advice. In his only public comment against Trump since leaving the presidency, Obama came out in support of the protests opposing President Donald Trump s executive order to restrict immigration from predominantly Muslim countries.A spokesman said the former president thinks they re  citizens exercising their Constitutional right to assemble, organize and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake.

Obama seeks funds to fight Zika; sees no cause for panic,"WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will ask the U.S. Congress for more than $1.8 billion in emergency funds to fight Zika at home and abroad and pursue a vaccine, the White House said on Monday, but he added there is no reason to panic over the mosquito-borne virus. Zika, spreading rapidly in South and Central America and the Caribbean, has been linked to severe birth defects in Brazil, and public health officials concern is focused on pregnant women and women who may become pregnant. Obamas request to Congress includes $200 million for research, development and commercialization of new vaccines and diagnostic tests for the virus. At least 12 groups are working to develop a vaccine. On Monday, the London-based European Medicines Agency (EMA), Europes drugs regulator, said it established an expert task force to advise companies working on Zika vaccines and medicines, mirroring similar action during the two-year-long  Ebola epidemic that started in December 2013 and the pandemic flu outbreak in 2009. There are no vaccines or treatment for Zika and none even undergoing clinical studies. Most infected people either have no symptoms or develop mild ones like fever and skin rashes. The good news is this is not like Ebola; people dont die of Zika. A lot of people get it and dont even know that they have it, Obama told CBS News in an interview aired on Monday. But there shouldnt be panic on this. This is not something where people are going to die from it. It is something we have to take seriously. Most of the money sought by Obama, who faces pressure from Republicans and some fellow Democrats to act decisively on Zika, would be spent in the United States on testing, surveillance and response in affected areas, including the creation of rapid-response teams to contain outbreak clusters. At a White House briefing, Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said she was not expecting large-scale amounts of serious Zika infections in the continental United States as warmer months bring larger and more active mosquito populations. We do think its likely that we will have limited local transmission in some of the southern states, Schuchat said. Obamas funding request to Congress includes $335 million for the U.S. Agency for International Development to support mosquito-control, maternal health and other Zika-related public health efforts in affected countries in the Americas. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the White House briefing a vaccine likely would not be widely available for a few years. Fauci said he anticipated beginning a so-called Phase 1 trial this summer for a Zika vaccine that would take about three months to test if it is safe and induces a good immune response before further studies can be conducted. The CDC said its Zika emergency operations center, with a staff of 300, has been placed on its highest level of activation, reflecting a need for accelerated preparedness for possible local virus transmission by mosquitoes in the continental United States. Some lawmakers have urged Obama to name a Zika czar to head U.S. efforts against the virus, but Fauci said he sees no need right now for such an appointment. Much remains unknown about Zika, including whether the virus actually causes microcephaly, a condition marked by abnormally small head size that can result in developmental problems. Brazil is investigating the potential link between Zika infections and more than 4,000 suspected cases of microcephaly.  Researchers have identified evidence of Zika infection in 17 of these cases, either in the baby or in the mother, but have not confirmed that Zika can cause microcephaly. Word that Zika can be spread by sexual transmission and blood transfusions and its discovery in saliva and urine of infected people have added to concern over the virus.  The World Health Organization declared the outbreak an international health emergency on Feb. 1, citing a strongly suspected relationship between Zika infection in pregnancy to microcephaly. Brazil is grappling with the virus even as it prepares to host the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in August, with tens of thousands of athletes and tourists anticipated. The U.S. Olympic Committee has told U.S. sports federations that athletes and staff concerned about their health due to Zika should consider not going to the Olympics. The message was delivered in a conference call involving USOC officials and leaders of U.S. sports federations in late January. Former Olympian Donald Anthony, president and board chairman of USA Fencing, said, One of the things that they immediately said was, especially for women that may be pregnant or even thinking of getting pregnant, that whether you are scheduled to go to Rio or no, that you shouldnt go. At the White House, Fauci said athletes would need to make a personal decision about whether or not to skip the Olympics.   ",1.0
Trump taps ex-Bush official Bossert to counter domestic threats,"PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday selected former Bush administration official Thomas Bossert as a counterterrorism adviser who will focus heavily on cyber threats. As assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, Bossert will concentrate on domestic security issues and help craft the administrations cyber security policies, the transition team said. We must work toward cyber doctrine that reflects the wisdom of free markets, private competition and the important but limited role of government in establishing and enforcing the rule of law ... and the fundamental principlesof liberty, Bossert said in a statement. Cyber security has been a hot button issue in recent weeks as Trump, a Republican, has lashed out against assertions that Russia directed hacks of U.S. Democratic Party emails to influence the U.S. presidential election. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia was behind the hacks. In a departure from the current administration, Bossert will report directly to Trump and will have his own staff that is not under the National Security Council, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said.  The structure is similar to the approach of Republican President George W. Bush, who set up a Homeland Security Council in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on New York City and Washington.  Bossert served as deputy homeland security adviser under Bush. Democratic President Barack Obama merged the Homeland Security Council staff with the National Security Council staff. Peter Feaver, a professor at Duke University who served on the National Security Council during the second Bush administration, said that making Bossert report to the president was not a large change. You could not call this a radical departure. This is the kind of evolutionary change that always happens with administrations, Feaver said.   ",1.0
 Heres Why Bill Maher Believes Trump Wants To Be President (VIDEO),"Although I disagree with Bill Maher that Donald Trump is not a clown, a conman, or a Klansman, I do think he has a point when he describes Trump as a five-year-old child. Maher said: What Donald Trump really reminds me of is a spoiled five-year-old throwing a tantrum. He is the grown-up version of every pain-in-the-ass kid who ever sat behind you on a plane kicking the back of your seat. While the parents did nothing    Little Logan  is just exploring. No,  Little Logan  is being a d*ck and if you won t shove him in the overhead bin, I will. Here s the video: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSSExfcD2cM] There s no doubt that Trump reminds you of such a d*ick and it seems that his voters are his enablers, tolerating condoning, and even applauding many of his crazy antics. Trump s rise, Maher argued, was not fueled by racism or xenophobia, but by what he called  the self-esteem movement.  As proof, Maher played a montage of clips showing Trump saying how he s the best at many things. He said: Like they say on reality shows, the most important thing is just  You doing you.  But what if you is a big a*shole? Maher said the real reason Trump wants to be president is not to help America but so he can be called president. Whatever the cause may be to his rise, it s important that the American people say no to this clown come November. Featured image via video screenshot. ",0.0
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AFFILIATE INVITED To Obamas State Of The UnionWill This Terror Group Also Be Invited?,"So in an effort to reach out to Muslims living in America, we need to invite groups that are tied to terrorists? Why stop at groups like CAIR? Why not invite ISIS? Perhaps we missed it, but we haven t seen the list of prominent Christian leaders invited to Obama s SOTU, who will represent the worldwide mass persecution of Christians As many as 25 House Democrats are expected to have Muslim guests during Tuesday night s State of the Union speech. It s in response to a call from Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, the first Muslim voted into Congress, to counter an  alarming rise in hateful rhetoric against Muslim Americans and people of the Islamic faith worldwide. The gesture might not generate much more than a shrug, except that in at least two cases, Democrats invited officials from a group the FBI formally avoids due to historic ties to a Hamas support network.Delray Beach Rep. Alcee Hastings invited Nezar Hamze, regional operations director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in Florida. And San Jose, Cal. Rep. Zoe Lofgren invited Sameena Usman, a 10-year veteran government relations official with CAIR s San Francisco chapter, the Investigative Project on Terrorism has learned.CAIR officials routinely accuse federal law enforcement of entrapping otherwise innocent and peaceful Muslims in order to gin up terrorism prosecutions. Hamze s colleagues in CAIR-Florida are helping a family sue the FBI over the 2013 fatal shooting of a terror suspect who attacked agents after extensive questioning. Usman s office published a notorious poster urging Muslims to  Build a Wall of Resistance [and] Don t Talk to the FBI.  For its part, the FBI cut off contact with CAIR, except in investigations, in 2008 based on evidence its agents uncovered which placed CAIR in a Hamas-support network in the United States. Until it can be shown that those connections no longer exist, an FBI official explained in 2009, CAIR is not  an appropriate liaison partner. In addition, several CAIR officials have compared Israel to ISIS.Calls to press contacts in Lofgren and Hastings  offices were not returned Monday.Last month, the IPT provided exclusive details from eyewitness accounts about CAIR s creation, including an account of how a co-founder sought approval from the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood for CAIR s bylaws, and how Executive Director Nihad Awad s move to Washington was  in order to represent Hamas. Hastings and Lofgren either failed to check out their guests  employer or they don t care. These connections have nothing to do with the faith of CAIR officials. But the organization has a record that elected officials stubbornly insist should be ignored. Unfortunately, this is part of a pattern of outreach House Democrats seek out with the wrong people. Last month, CAIR-Florida s Hassan Shibly was invited to the White House for a discussion about religious discrimination. Then, as with the State of the Union speech, no one from the new Muslim Reform Movement   which issued a declaration clearly rejecting  interpretations of Islam that call for any violence, social injustice and politicized Islam  and standing for  peace, human rights and secular governance.

Finland should stay militarily non-aligned: prime minister,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland should remain militarily neutral because it helps ensure security in the Baltic Sea region, Prime Minister Juha Sipila said in an interview ahead of celebrations of the country s 100 years of independence. The EU member state was part of the Russian Empire and won independence during the 1917 Russian revolution but it nearly lost it fighting the Soviet Union in World War Two. The center-right government retains the option of seeking NATO membership but remaining non-aligned and increasing defense cooperation with Sweden and the EU was Finland s way, Sipila said.  At the moment, to have Finland and Sweden forming this militarily non-aligned zone, I think that increases the security and stability in the Baltic Sea region ... I see no reason to change this,  Sipila told Reuters by phone. Finland has stepped up military cooperation with Sweden and forged closer ties with NATO because it is concerned about Russia s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and heightened East-West tensions in the Baltic Sea.  However, the government has opted to stay out of NATO in line with its tradition of avoiding confrontation with Russia. A report commissioned by the government said last year that if Finland joined NATO it would lead to a crisis with Russia, which is also a major trade partner for Finland. Moscow has hinted that it could move troops closer to the Finnish-Russian border if Finland joins NATO.  It is clear that Finland is part of the West and the western community. That is our place,  Sipila said.  We want to be ... at the core of the European Union, influencing EU s future. But the main difference between us and the majority of EU states is our military non-alignment.  Polls show that only 22 percent of Finns support NATO membership, while 62 percent are opposed. Sipila, who leads Finland s Centre party, said any move to join would need public approval via a referendum. Finance Minister Petteri Orpo from Finland s poll-leading National Coalition party told Reuters last week he believed that joining NATO would improve Finland s security. ",1.0
Election campaigning underway in Japan as Abe takes on Hope,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Election campaigning in Japan began in earnest on Tuesday with  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe seeking to repel an upstart new party that has pledged to rid the government of cronyism in a challenge to Abe s near-five year hold on power.     The Oct. 22 lower house election pits Abe s Liberal Democratic Party-led coalition against the less than one-month-old Party of Hope headed by popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, a former LDP lawmaker often floated as a possible first female premier. Abe says he needs to renew his mandate to tackle a  national crisis  stemming from North Korea s nuclear and missile threat and the demographic time-bomb of Japan s fast-ageing population. The 63-year-old Abe called the poll amid opposition disarray and an uptick in approval ratings that had slid due to a series of scandals over suspected cronyism. But the sudden emergence of Koike s party, which also appeals to conservative voters, could upset Abe s calculation. The main opposition Democratic Party imploded last month and a big chunk of its candidates are running on the Party of Hope ticket. In his first campaign speech Abe attacked the opposition for using populist slogans.   What creates our future is not a boom or slogan. It is policy that creates our future,  Abe said in Fukushima in northeast Japan.  We just cannot afford to lose.   The LDP-led coalition is defending a two-thirds  super majority  in parliament s lower house, so losing its simple majority would be a major upset. Abe s LDP had 288 seats in the lower house before it was dissolved for the election, while its junior partner the Komeito had 35. The total number of seats has been cut to 465 from 475. Recent opinion polls show the LDP in the lead and some analysts think Abe could still pull off another landslide victory. A poll of 3,119 voters by public broadcaster NHK released on Tuesday showed 36 percent had positive expectations for the Party of Hope, down from 47 percent in a survey a week ago. Support for Abe s government was unchanged, at 37 percent.  A soggy performance for the LDP, however, could stir calls from inside the party to replace Abe or deny him a third term as LDP leader in September 2018, ending his chances of becoming Japan s longest-serving premier. Koike, who defied the LDP last year to run for governor, calls her fledgling party a  reformist, conservative  group free from the fetters of vested interests   an often popular campaign slogan in Japan.  We have a surplus of things in this country, but what we don t have is hope for the future,  said Koike, 65, kicking off her campaign outside one of Tokyo s major train stations.  Koike decided not to run for a lower house seat needed to make her eligible for the premiership and has declined to say whom her party would support for the post, leaving the door open to a variety of possible tie-ups including with Abe s LDP.  The Party of Hope looks a lot like the LDP, but doesn t have the same problem with vested interests,  said Koji Sasaya, 82, a U.S. resident and longtime LDP supporter who traveled to Japan to vote in the election for Koike s new party. Others outside the station were less convinced by Koike s talk of cleaner politics, while trusting Abe to safeguard national security.  I doubt she can deliver politics free from vested interests,  said Minori Hiramatsu, a 28-year-old mother of one who was on her way to a job interview.  Abe has problems domestically, but he is the best person to protect us from North Korean threats.   The Party of Hope echoes Abe s LDP on security and diplomacy - it backs tough sanctions on North Korea and controversial security measures adopted in 2015 to expand the military s role overseas. Koike also agrees with Abe that Japan s post-war, U.S.-drafted, pacifist constitution should be amended, though not necessarily on the changes needed. On economic policies, Koike s party has sought to differentiate itself by demanding an end to nuclear power by 2030 and a freeze on a sales tax hike planned for 2019. Abe wants to keep nuclear power as a key part of Japan s energy mix, and raise the sales tax and spend more of the revenues on education and child care. A center-left Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, formed from the liberal wing of the failed Democratic Party, is wooing voters dissatisfied with both conservative options.  ",1.0

U.S. says it wants Syrian government to negotiate 'seriously' with opposition,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Friday urged supporters of the Syrian government to press it to  participate fully  in negotiations with the opposition, saying a lack of a political resolution in the war-torn country threatened indefinite instability. In a statement, a spokeswoman for the State Department said the United States wanted the government s supporters  to use their leverage to urge the regime to participate fully in tangible negotiations with the opposition in Geneva.   The United States urges all parties to work seriously toward a political resolution to this conflict or face continued isolation and instability indefinitely in Syria,  spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. A United Nations negotiator characterized a round of peace talks that ended on Thursday as a missed opportunity, and he laid most of the blame at the feet of Syria s government. ",1.0
Britain will not pay 'a penny more' than it thinks right to leave EU: Boris Johnson,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will pay  not a penny more, not a penny less  than what the government thinks its legal obligations are to the European Union as the country leaves the bloc, foreign minister Boris Johnson said on Friday. Talking to BBC Radio Four, Johnson said his comment that the EU could  go whistle  on its demands for payment was in response to being asked whether Britain would pay  100 billion euros or pounds , and not a suggestion that the government would not pay. A financial settlement is set to be one of the most difficult issues to resolve in negotiations to unravel more than 40 years of union, and the EU has said it is one of three areas the two sides must make progress on before starting talks on a future relationship, including trading arrangements.  Some of the sums that I ve seen seem to be very high. Of course, we will meet our obligations,  Johnson said.  We should pay not a penny more, not a penny less of what we think our legal obligations amount to.  ",1.0
Swiss government urges voters to reject call for national ban on face veils,"ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss government urged voters on Wednesday to reject a campaign for a nationwide ban on face veils, saying any  decision on facial coverings was a matter for Switzerland s cantons individually. But, in a counter move to a referendum to be held by 2020, the government said it would propose to voters a ban on face veils being worn by individuals while doing business with federal authorities, including in immigration offices or employment agencies.  Regulation of public spaces in Switzerland is traditionally a cantonal matter,  the government said in a statement.  So cantons should continue to decide for themselves whether to enact a ban on facial coverings.  In particular, it said it was down to individual cantons to decide how they handled tourists from the Arab world who wore the veil. In September, activists submitted a petition for a nationwide ban after collecting more than the 100,000 signatures required to put the proposal to a binding referendum. Several cantons have already taken a stand on the issue. Zurich, Solothurn, Schwyz, Basel City and Glarus have rejected a ban on veils, while Italian-speaking Ticino has imposed a ban. At least two demonstrators who wore veils in Ticino in defiance of the ban were fined 250 Swiss francs ($260), according to media reports. The parliament in St. Gallen canton this year backed a ban on facial coverings which were deemed likely to endanger public security or upset the peace. With an eye to the referendum, the federal government said it would also present a proposal to stop individuals being forced to cover their face.  We can not allow husbands and fathers to demand their wives and daughters wear a face veil,  Justice Minister Simonetta Sommaruga told a news conference. ",1.0
"Oscar Winning Actress JENNIFER LAWRENCE Recalls Attending Same Concert As Trump: I was adamant on finding him and then making a video of me going, Hey Trump, f*ck you!

But let s hear how funny it is that some nit-wit actress who is supported by the general public (not just Democrats) wanted to track down Trump to make a video attempting to humiliate him. I m actually sorry she never found him, it would ve been an amazing career ending move.

Uzbek writer plans cautious return from exile,"ALMATY (Reuters) - When Uzbek writer Nurulloh Muhammad Raufkhon s new book came out last year, security forces raided his home and put the author - who was in Turkey at the time - on their blacklist, effectively forcing him to stay there in exile. Now, after being removed from the list by the new government, the 62-year-old Raufkhon plans to return to his Central Asian homeland - despite harboring some misgivings. A safe return of prominent dissidents such as Raufkhon might herald a genuine thaw in Uzbekistan and mark a significant step toward restoring ties with the West and attracting foreign investment after decades of political and economic near-isolation under the late President Islam Karimov. No prominent dissidents have returned home yet though since Karimov died a year ago and Raufkhon said some of his fellow emigres were still unconvinced it was safe to do so. Raufkhon s book, entitled Bu Kunlar (These Days), was a critique of Uzbekistan s development since it became independent from the Soviet Union in 1991. By publishing it, he went against a well-established taboo on criticizing Karimov, who ran the nation of 32 million with an iron fist from 1989, first as a Communist apparatchik and then as an elected leader. He died in September last year from a stroke aged 78.  They all but made me an  enemy of the people ,  traitor of the motherland ,  Raufkhon, who lives in Istanbul, said in an interview with Reuters conducted by email and telephone. Last month, the government of Shavkat Mirziyoyev, a former prime minister who has succeeded Karimov, removed some 16,000 people, including Raufkhon, from its security blacklist. That prompted him to start thinking about a return home. But he had second thoughts very soon - and he is still slightly apprehensive of possible action by a Karimov  old guard .  After they removed me from the blacklist, somebody decided to put up a list of wanted criminals with photos in the district where I am registered,  he said.  My name was among them.  Local officials quickly corrected the mistake and covered up his photo, he said, but the incident all the same made him uneasy.  I didn t understand this. Do we have a parallel state?  he said.  (But) in the end, I dismissed this as a mistake and decided to return. To address mistakes like that you need to be back home.  Raufkhon said there could be more setbacks.  Of course, it is impossible to swiftly change a regime based on violence,  he said, adding that a  Karimov-era elite  was strongly resisting reforms. One of the new government s moves that has raised eyebrows  was the sacking last month of Khurshid Mirzohidov, a reformist chief executive of state television company MTRK. Mirzohidov, previously minister for information technology development, was appointed to MTRK in February as part of a broad reshuffle which followed Mirziyoyev s election last December. A major change brought on by Mirzohidov was a series of Q&A sessions broadcast live on national television in which senior officials had to answer tough questions - such as those about the use of forced labor in cotton harvesting. After Mirzohidov was sacked, Alisher Khajayev, who had run state television under Karimov, took back the top job. Though live broadcasts have continued after the reshuffle, Khajayev has yet to show he will maintain the same probing TV programs as Mirzohidov. Speaking of fellow emigres, Raufkhon said:  They would have come back in an instant, but what stands in their way is uncertainty about what is going to happen to them upon return.  He urged the government to amnesty all opposition activists and guarantee their safety upon return. Raufkhon said he would announce the date of his own return this week. ",1.0
Factbox: Candidate platforms in Chile presidential runoff,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Center-left Senator Alejandro Guillier and conservative billionaire Sebastian Pinera will go head to head in a runoff for Chile s presidency on Sunday, after securing the top two spots in the Nov. 19 first-round vote. There have been no major polls in the past month, leaving few indications of who will succeed outgoing center-left President Michelle Bachelet in the world s top copper producer. Below are the main proposals from both candidates:  - The former journalist, elected to the Senate in 2013, has promised to deepen the progressive tax, education and labor reforms of ideological ally Bachelet. His spending plan includes investments in housing and infrastructure and carries a price tag of $10 billion.  - Guillier has pledged to diversify Chile s economy away from copper, or add value to exports by processing the metal at home. He would seek a plebiscite in 2018 to rewrite the dictatorship-era constitution to include more protections for workers and indigenous communities.  - Since the first round, Guillier and Pinera have both endorsed a  public option  to compete with Chile s private pension funds. Once widely praised worldwide, they have been criticized for delivering too-small payouts. Guillier has also recommended a new, mandatory contribution from employers.  - Guillier and Pinera have both called for repeal of state-run copper producer Codelco s mandatory contribution of 10 percent of profits to the military. Guillier has signaled he would seek to maintain the government s strong ties with Codelco workers, something that has spared the company from strikes that have hit private miners under Bachelet. - The billionaire businessman, who served as president from 2010 to 2014, has promised to make Chile the first country in Latin America to achieve  developed nation  status in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based club of wealthy nations. - Pinera, the investor favorite, would cut corporate taxes to increase investment. He said his policies would double Chile s economic growth and eliminate poverty by 2025.  - Pinera s $14 billion, four-year spending plan includes an overhaul of Bachelet s tax reform, and $2.7 billion in new investments in infrastructure and hospitals. Pinera said he would pay for his proposals by cutting  unnecessary  government spending and simplifying the tax code. - Pinera wants to revitalize and increase competition in Chile s private pension system. His plan includes new subsidies to raise pensions for women and the middle class, as well as incentives to encourage workers to retire later. - He wants Codelco to deploy a  realistic investment plan using existing resources  and to focus on existing assets rather than new projects.

OBAMAS WAR ON AMERICA UPDATE: FBI ISSUES RIOT ALERT For LouisianaNew Black Panthers Coming To Baton Rouge,"We reported earlier about Dallas cop killer, Micah X. Johnson and his affiliation with the New Black Panther group, as well as Obama s past history with them. These acts leading up the GOP convention are no accident. We are living in dangerous times, and the most evil man to ever occupy our White House has been working in conjunction with BLM leaders to make sure this divisive movement succeeds The FBI issued an alert to Louisiana law enforcement agencies warning of violence against officers and planned riots in the aftermath of this week s high-profile fatal shooting of a black man by Baton Rouge Police. Judicial Watch obtained a copy of the situational information report, which was distributed to police and sheriff departments in Bossier, Caddo Parish and east Baton Rouge as well as Louisiana State Police.Titled  Violence Against Law Enforcement Officers and Riots Planned for 8-10 July 2016,  the alert warns that  multiple groups are calling for or planning riots and/or violence against law enforcement in Baton Rouge and Shreveport, Louisiana beginning Friday July 8 2016 and continuing through at least July 10, 2016. The document is labeled  FOUO  (For Official Use Only), a term the government uses to mark sensitive information that s not classified. It was issued by the New Orleans division of the FBI. The agency did not respond to multiple calls from Judicial Watch for comment.A spokesman for the Louisiana State Police Department, Lieutenant JB Slaton, referred Judicial Watch to the FBI and would not confirm or deny that his agency received it even though it appears on the list of recipients.  That s an FBI bulletin, they would need to address it,  Slaton told Judicial Watch after being provided with a copy of the FBI alert. When asked if his agency got the FBI alert Slaton continued to be evasive, responding that  it s an FBI bulletin. The alert is dated July 7 and includes disturbing images from social media, including one depicting a restrained uniformed police officer getting his throat slashed by a masked individual. Other social media images call for purging and killing all cops in Baton Rouge on July 9 and starting a riot by the courthouse in Shreveport that will tear shi_ _ down without killing our own black people.  Calling for unity in the violent protests, one social media post says  it don t matter what color you are.  Another says  must kill every police!!!!   Judicial WatchMeanwhile The  New Black Panther Party,  a militant racial group, announced that they will be arriving in Baton Rouge to protest outside of the Baton Rouge Police Department after Alton Sterling was shot during an altercation with a local officer, calling the headquarters the  pig department. On the group s social media, they called the police department the  Baton Rouge Pig Department,  a term that is often used by militants against police officers across the country, in an exclusive Hayride report.Check out the invitation to the protest, which is supposed to take place tomorrow and where sources tell the Hayride that out-of-towners are expected to show up in order to wreak havoc on the city.

Senator seeks ethics probe of Mnuchin's 'Lego Batman' comment,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee asked the government ethics watchdog on Monday to review comments by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin plugging The Lego Batman Movie, a film one of his companies produced, for a possible ethics violation. In a letter to Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub, Senator Ron Wyden said he was concerned that Mnuchin had violated his ethics agreement signed in January in his comments on Friday at the end of a live interview with the Axios news website. Mnuchin had agreed to divest his interests in Ratpac-Dune Entertainment Holdings LLC within 120 days of his confirmation, and not participate personally and substantially in any matter that has a direct and predictable effect on the financial interests of the entity unless first obtaining a waiver. RatPac-Dune, co-founded by Mnuchin with producer-director Brett Rattner and media billionaire James Packer, has produced and financed a number of Hollywood hits in recent years, including Avatar, Mad Max: Fury Road and The Lego Batman Movie. At the Axios event, Mnuchin was asked in a question from a reader for a movie recommendation. Im not allowed to promote anything that Im involved in.  So I just want to have the legal disclosure, youve asked me the question, and I am not promoting any product, Mnuchin said. But you should send all your kids to Lego Batman. The comment drew laughter from the audience at the Washington event. Wyden said the Finance Committee had received no notifications regarding Mnuchins holdings in RatPac-Dune and assumed the Treasury chief still held that interest. I am concerned that Sec. Mnuchins comments, may be seen to have a predictable effect on the financial interests of RatPac-Dune, Wyden said in his letter. In a statement, a Treasury spokesman said: As his statement reflects, the Secretary clearly recognized that he generally may not promote private interests and specifically gave the legal disclosure that he was not promoting a movie, but answering a question he was asked directly. The OGE recommended last month that the White House should consider disciplinary action against President Donald Trumps adviser Kellyanne Conway for her on-air comment on Fox News Channel promoting the clothing and jewelry line of Trumps daughter Ivanka Trump. Conway said people should go buy Ivankas stuff. The White House later told the ethics watchdog that Conway had acted inadvertently and without nefarious motive or intent to benefit personally. ",1.0
Corporate tax reform negotiators aim above Trump's 15 percent pledge,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump campaigned on cutting the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15 percent, but administration officials said on Monday negotiators engaged in closed-door talks are now shooting for a little over 20 percent because they realize the super-low rate would balloon the federal deficit. Republican leaders in the House of Representatives and the Senate are unlikely to allow the budget deficit to grow, so officials said they now hope for a corporate tax at the low end of a 20 percent to 25 percent range. Its going to be truly deficit neutral, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told reporters. Were going for permanence. That means our reforms have to balance in the budget. Six months into Trumps presidency, Republicans who control House, Senate and the White House have yet to agree on important features of a tax code overhaul. Under Senate rules, Republicans who want to take advantage of their simple majority and pass tax legislation without Democratic support must show the new policies will not add to the federal deficit after 10 years. Cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from a current 35 percent would cost more than $2 trillion over a decade, according to independent analysts, and that total would be hard to offset when proposals to raise revenue face broad political opposition. I dont think there are $2 trillion of politically saleable offsets on the corporate side of the ledger, said Rohit Kumar, a former aide to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell who now serves as a principal in the tax policy group at the consulting and accounting firm PwC LLP. Two House Republican proposals could help pay for such a reduction: a border adjustment tax and a proposed elimination of business deduction of debt interest payments. But these face broad opposition from industry and many Republican lawmakers. Administration officials hope the negotiators will agree on a plan by the end of July, convert it to legislation during August, unveil it in September and have Trump sign it into law well before the end of 2017. Independent analysts and lobbyists say a more likely timeline would see the release of tax legislation in October or November and a vote in early 2018.  The negotiators, Brady, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Finance Committee Chair Orrin Hatch, have yet to agree on a new corporate tax rate or how to pay for tax cuts. They also have yet to agree on which tax breaks to eliminate or whether to include a controversial border tax on imports. They want to end taxation on the foreign profits of U.S. multinational corporations and must agree on a measure to stop U.S. corporations from moving headquarters and shifting profits overseas. Lobbyists say the group is likely to consider a minimum tax on foreign corporate earnings as an alternative to the border tax.  Some Republicans in Congress acknowledge that it will be a challenge to identify tax code changes that can unite party factions now battling over healthcare and a fiscal 2018 budget that includes a legislative tool crucial for passing tax legislation without Democratic votes. The question is, can we get a framework that has a chance of passage? And the answer to that is, well see, Hatch told reporters after taking part in a principals meeting last week. ",1.0

 WOW: Duck Dynasty Star Phil Robertson Offers Up The Worst Proof Ever That Jesus Was Real,"No one can accuse Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson of being able to use the few brain his god saw fit to bless him with. Nobody can accuse him of not clinging so desperately to his faith that he literally can t see anything else, either. To that end, while speaking at the Western Conservative Summit in Denver, he put forth what he no doubt believes is ironclad proof that the son of his god, Jesus Christ, actually existed.What s his proof? It s definitely not scientific proof. It s also not even biblical proof. No his proof is so uniquely out there that it defies description: [The] calendar documents it is 2016 years since Jesus showed up, right? So don t tell me he wasn t here!By the way, if your calendar is dated of all the human beings who have ever walked on the Earth, and your calendar is dedicated and predicated to just one of  em, evidently something rather large went down. Wow, he s really got us there.This is a good time to start scratching your head while wondering just what manner of derpiness this is. Our calendar, dedicated to just Jesus, simply because it s the year 2016? Don t make us laugh too hard. It hurts, especially considering that the names of most of the months are based on things that are so un-Christian they re blasphemy:Robertson could stand to read this little history lesson if he s going to make wild claims about our calendar, although it s entirely possible that he d call it all Satan s lies, or something like that. It s really hard to cure someone like him of willful ignorance; he d just come up with more willful ignorance.Featured image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",0.0
PRESIDENT OF RADICAL GROUP Advised Hillary On How To Fake Concern For Parents Of Black Lives Matter VictimsBlame Cops For Pain [VIDEO],"Wikileaks released an email from Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden, coaching Hillary on how to best gain the trust of the Black community by going directly to the victims being held up by Black Lives Matter movement as heroes, and faking empathy with the parents. She also mentions it would be a good idea to use the idea that their grief should be magnified because it happened at the hands of law enforcement officers (the state). The email was forwarded by Jen Palmieri who is the same person who was busted criticizing Catholics. Karen Finney, Hiilary s Senior Advisor for Communications and Political Outreach, & Senior Spokesperson for Hillary for America was also copied on the suggestion about how to fake concern for parents of Black Lives Matter victims.Here is an excerpt from the Wikileaks email:Hillary clearly took her advice, as she can been seen milking her phony support for mother s of Black Lives Matter victims by giving them a chance to appear at the DNC as her  special guests  to chant :Ever the actress, here s Hillary appealing to the black community with her newfound black dialect:",0.0

WHY DID THE UN HAVE A PRO-GUN CONTROL MEETING AT SPA IN MEXICO And Why Werent Dissenters Allowed?,"Government officials using other people s money to enjoy a swanky seaside vacation in Mexico while discussing how to take away our right to bear arms Sounds about right The first annual meeting of the nations that have ratified the 2014 Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) opened on Monday, August 24 at a spa in Canc n, Mexico. The treaty s been controversial in the U.S. from the moment negotiations on it began, and this meeting will surely stoke the suspicions of those who think the treaty s real aim is to crimp America s sovereignty and constitutional liberties.The meeting was originally supposed to be in Mexico City, but wouldn t you rather spend your off-hours by the pool?Of course, you may think it s weird, or sick, that all these nations pretend to believe that the best place to discuss the arms trade is at a seaside resort. After all, many of them spend all their time pleading poverty and demanding aid from the U.S. to implement the treaty.But frankly, they don t care how bad it looks. They ve got a great boondoggle going, and no one s going to spoil it for them.But everyone s going to Mexico not just because it s got great beaches. Mexico has been one of the leading campaigners for the ATT. It wants to use the treaty to promote gun control in the U.S.Mexico s theory is that, since any gun in the U.S. might at some point conceivably cross the U.S. border, all U.S. guns have to be controlled in the name of controlling the international arms trade. That s not going to happen at this meeting (or ever, if the U.S. retains its sanity).But Mexico, the other nations that agree with it, and  progressive  groups that campaigned for the treaty the blame-America-first activists, in other words are in this game for the long haul. So it s not a good sign that Mexico s been given the job of hosting the first treaty meeting.It s even less good that Mexico s spent much of the past year colluding with the activists to keep skeptics (like myself) out of the room. Their view was that only true believers who campaigned for the treaty should be allowed to see what s going on.You might wonder what they re afraid of. We skeptics make no secret of our views, but we re a well-mannered bunch: no spitballs. However, if we were always in the room, we d report on exactly how closely the activists are working with Mexico and other likeminded nations.The activists led by the global Control Arms Coalition, which has a massive presence at Canc n are the only insiders in the treaty process, and they want to keep it that way.The ATT was adopted through the U.N., which means it was drafted by the world s nations. That s bad, because there are lots of incapable and evil governments in the world. But it s better than the alternative, which was for the ATT to have been drafted solely by the activists.Now that the treaty exists, however, the activists want to take it over and direct it for their own purposes. What they want is to turn the ATT into an arms control and disarmament treaty.Keeping skeptics away is part of that campaign.So far, they ve not succeeded in keeping us out, or in taking over the treaty. But the ATT isn t simply a treaty that s over and done with. Like many treaties, it s a process that will go on and on, in meeting after meeting, year after year. And the activists have lots of people, lots of money, and lots of time.The U.S. s goal in Canc n should be to do whatever it can to prevent the activists from getting any footholds. That means ensuring a treaty secretariat that s strictly limited in its purposes, conference rules that don t privilege the activists, and reporting requirements that don t go beyond current U.S. practice or identify individual U.S. firearms owners.Via: Daily Signal",0.0
 Biggest Leak EVER Exposes How The 1% Dodges Millions In Taxes (VIDEO),"A secret cache of documents revealing the tax avoidance techniques used by some of the world s most elite politicians, leaders, and celebrities has been leaked to the press. Dubbed  the Panama Papers  the 11.5 million documents come from the servers of Mossack Fonseca, the fourth biggest offshore law firm in the world.The Panama Papers were leaked by an anonymous source to S ddeutsche Zeitung, a German newspaper. They were then shared with the UK Guardian and the BBC.Some revelations from the documents, according to The Guardian who describes them as  an unprecedented leak :While legal, storing money offshore to avoid taxes has been a loophole exploited by the rich and well-connected in a way that drives average citizens and taxpayers insane. In the 2012 election, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney was pilloried for moving money offshore to the Cayman Islands, in what was condemned as a way to avoid paying taxes.Corporations, of course, hide their funds offshore at an even larger scale than individual millionaires and billionaires. Apple, for instance, has been exposed for this practice. Apple keeps enough money offshore to avoid paying $59.2 billion in U.S. taxes it would otherwise be liable for if it kept that money in American accounts. Google kept $47 billion offshore, while Microsoft found a way to skip out on paying $34.5 billion in American taxes by keeping its money on foreign soil.This leak won t end offshore tax avoidance, but it may put more pressure on governments to close some of the loopholes the 1 percent is exploiting as the rest of us pay our bills.Featured image via Flickr",0.0
Michael Bloomberg may launch independent U.S. presidential bid: source,"(Reuters) - Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, has told his aides to draw up plans for an independent campaign for the U.S. presidency, according to a source familiar with the situation. Bloomberg has advised friends and associates that he would be willing to spend at least $1 billion of his own money on a campaign for the November 2016 election, according to the source, who spoke on condition on anonymity to discuss the former mayors thinking.  News of Bloomberg mulling a presidential run was first reported Saturday by the New York Times. Bloomberg, 73, has given himself an early March deadline for entering the race, the source said, after commissioning a poll in December to see how he would fare against Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the Republican and Democratic frontrunners.  No third-party candidate has ever won a U.S. presidential election. But Bloomberg, who has close Wall Street ties and liberal social views, sees an opening for his candidacy if Republicans nominate Trump or Texas Senator Ted Cruz and the Democrats nominate Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, the source said. Bloomberg, who has long privately flirted with the idea of mounting a presidential run, served as mayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013. He switched his party affiliation from Republican to independent in 2007 and in recent years has spent millions on national campaigns to tighten U.S. gun laws and reform immigration. One unnamed Bloomberg adviser told the Times the former mayor believes voters want a non-ideological, bipartisan, results-oriented vision that has not been offered in the 2016 election cycle by either political party. A well-financed presidential run by Bloomberg would likely disrupt the dynamics of the election, but the billionaire would face significant hurdles in a race that has been in full swing for nearly a year. Though no third-party candidate has ever claimed the White House, several previous bids have affected the overall makeup of the race. In 1992 Texas businessman Ross Perot ran as an independent, a decision that some believe helped Democrat Bill Clinton defeat incumbent Republican George H. W. Bush. Bloomberg earned 13 percent support when facing a hypothetical three-way race against Clinton and Trump, according to a poll of 4,060 registered voters conducted January 14-17 by Morning Consult. Trump and Clinton were virtually tied at 37 and 36 percent, respectively, the survey found. Part of Bloombergs motivation to enter the race stems from a frustration with Clintons campaign, the source said. Clinton has been dogged by questions about her honesty amid an ongoing investigation into her use of a private email server as secretary of state. Sanders, Clintons chief rival, has recently surged in polling in key early voting states Iowa and New Hampshire. That development has made Bloomberg increasingly worried about a general election between Sanders, a self-described socialist, and Trump or Cruz, both of whom have staked out far-right positions on issues like immigration. At the New Hampshire Republican Party First in the Nation Presidential Town Hall in Nashua, Senator Rand Paul, who is lagging badly in opinion polls, seemed unfazed by the possibility of a Bloomberg third-party run. He even saw a bright side for his party. If he splits the Democrat vote - those for gun control - that might be good for Republicans, Paul told reporters. Representatives for Bloomberg declined to comment on the former mayors plans for the presidential race.

POLITICAL AGITATOR: Globalist George Soros Linked to Over 50 Partners of the Womens March on Washington,"21st Century Wire says More than 50 NGO  partners  of the Women s March on Washington were found to be tied to social movement financier George Soros. While the DC gathering was billed as a grassroots movement for women s rights in America, it was anything but as a string of multi-million dollar Democratic Party-affiliated NGO s organized what was clearly an anti-Donald Trump event following the US presidential inauguration this past week.  DIVIDE BY DESIGN    (Photo illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)As we ve stated before here at 21WIRE, this kind of political protest is designed to first cause public disruption, while also fomenting a form of socially-engineered cultural, gender and class warfare.In the case of the Women s March on Washington, a militant style of identity politics was on a full frontal display. Enter stage left   the celebrities This was never more apparent than the hate filled diatribe of Hollywood actress Ashley Judd, whose angry rhetoric was eclipsed only by famed singer Madonna, who during her obscenity laced speech admitted to harboring violent thoughts directed at the White House. Consequently, the Material Girl is now reportedly under Secret Service investigation for her bomb related threat this past Saturday.Watch how both Judd and Madonna are driven by rage during their politically divisive speeches at the Women s March on Washington https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-5ZkrQHyNcDuring an interview with ABC NEWS, Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway  didn t see the point,  of the Women s March. Additionally, Conway underscored that 29-30 million women across America voted for Trump and their voices were heard in the 2016 election https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVEiGcT9wD4QUESTION: Was the heavily organized Women s March on Washington just another example of a radical globalist and cultural Marxist  progressive  agenda at play?Historically speaking, many social movements have worked to erode the legitimacy of a democratically elected government through a series of artificial  color  upheavals (color revolutions), and where possible   weakening a country s national sovereignty through forced dependency on multilateral globalist institutions like the UN or IMF, while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the public s political perspective.This is how the US and its CIA conduct their destablization  color revolution  campaigns overseas, and now astute observers will recognize these exact same methods being deployed here inside the US.Overseas, Washington tends to use the same cast of NGO fronts to build-up pro-US political opposition groups, as well as plan and generate civil unrest. They include the Albert Einstein Institute (AEI), National Endowment for Democracy (NED), International Republican Institute (IRI), National Democratic Institute (NDI), Freedom House and later the International Center for Non-Violent Conflict (ICNC), and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the financial and contractor arm of the Department of State.Inside the US, deep state actors in Washington generally work through Democratic Party affiliated organizations like MoveOn.org, as well as through labor union organizations like AFL-CIO, and UNITE HERE. These, along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this latest protest movement in America.While it still remains to be seen if Trump s stated political vision for America can unite an embattled nation, one thing is clear   many NGO groups operating inside the US will continue their organized opposition to the newly elected president over the course of his time in the White House.  BITTER PILL    Madonna s waning singing career gives way to cultural upheaval and demagoguery. (Image Source: Extra.ie)Other  partners  for the march included the American Atheists and UniteWomen.org, who ran a public relations campaign which featured videos with the hashtags #ImWithHer, #DemsInPhily and #ThanksObama. Once again, all road lead back to billionaire Hillary Clinton financier, George Soros and his Open Society NGO empire.Writer Asra Nomani expands on the Soros web here: By my draft research, which I m opening up for crowd-sourcing on GoogleDocs, Soros has funded, or has close relationships with, at least 56 of the march s  partners,  including  key partners  Planned Parenthood, which opposes Trump s anti-abortion policy, and the National Resource Defense Council, which opposes Trump s environmental policies. The other Soros ties with  Women s March  organizations include the partisan MoveOn.org (which was fiercely pro-Clinton), the National Action Network (which has a former executive director lauded by Obama senior advisor Valerie Jarrett as  a leader of tomorrow  as a march co-chair and another official as  the head of logistics ). Other Soros grantees who are  partners  in the march are the American Civil Liberties Union, Center for Constitutional Rights, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. March organizers and the organizations identified here haven t yet returned queries for comment. NOTE: See her full story below.The Free Thought Project illustrates the contrived socially engineered nature behind the Women s March on Washington in lengthy passage below:Washington, D.C.   An investigation by a New York Times affiliate has revealed that billionaire globalist financier George Soros, who recently called Donald Trump a  would-be dictator  during an interview at Davos, and whose Open Society Foundation works to finance and forward progressive causes across the world, and is intimately connected to numerous color revolutions, the Arab Spring, and various other political uprisings across the globe, has been revealed to be connected to more than 50 of the groups that organized the nationwide  Women s Marches  that saw millions of Americans take to the streets across the country.The march s official website says,  We stand together, recognizing that defending the most marginalized among us is defending all of us.  Many people turned out to be a manifestation of that ideal, but it s important to understand the reality of what is happening on a strategic political level as an inorganic politically contrived and funded event. This, in no way, takes away from the validity of standing up for women s issues but is important to note that women are being used as pawns in a larger ideological political game that has international overtones of power politics.These marches were largely billed as  spontaneous  and  grassroots  actions, by publications like The Guardian and Vox. However, the reality exposed by an investigation by self-described liberal feminist Asra Q. Nomani, writing for New York Times affiliate Women in the World, revealed that after studying the  funding, politics and talking points of the some 403 groups that are  partners  of the march, contrary to the non-partisan rhetoric used in these marches, they were not really  women s march  but were rather  for women who are anti-Trump. Nomani reveals that the  Women s Marches  were actually organized as political tools to be used to strategically forward a progressive political agenda against President Donald Trump   exposing the protests to largely be an organized, top-down driven political operation   and not an organic movement of concerned Americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media.

(Image Source: thefederalist.com). Asra Q. Nomani NY Times   Women in the WorldIn the pre-dawn darkness of today s presidential inauguration day, I faced a choice, as a lifelong liberal feminist who voted for Donald Trump for president: lace up my pink Nike sneakers to step forward and take the DC Metro into the nation s capital for the inauguration of America s new president, or wait and go tomorrow to the after-party, dubbed the  Women s March on Washington ? The Guardian has touted the  Women s March on Washington  as a  spontaneous  action for women s rights. Another liberal media outlet, Vox, talks about the  huge, spontaneous groundswell  behind the march. On its website, organizers of the march are promoting their work as a grassroots effort with  independent  organizers. Even my local yoga studio, Beloved Yoga, is renting a bus and offering seats for $35. The march s manifesto says magnificently,  The Rise of the Woman = The Rise of the Nation. It s an idea that I, a liberal feminist, would embrace. But I know   and most of America knows   that the organizers of the march haven t put into their manifesto: the march really isn t a  women s march.  It s a march for women who are anti-Trump. As someone who voted for Trump, I don t feel welcome, nor do many other women who reject the liberal identity-politics that is the core underpinnings of the march, so far, making white women feel unwelcome, nixing women who oppose abortion and hijacking the agenda. To understand the march better, I stayed up through the nights this week, studying the funding, politics and talking points of the some 403 groups that are  partners  of the march.

STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS OUT! Connected To Benghazi Scandal And Clinton E-mail Scandal [Video],"The Washington Post reported that higher ups in the State Department jumped ship before Rex Tillerson could take the helm but we don t know that was the case. Were the people who left asked to vacate their post or did they jump ship? WaPo was even called out by CNN for the misleading headline.   One of the things that the main stream media doesn t mention is that these officials were knee deep in the Benghazi Scandal and one of those (see below for more on Patrick Kennedy) was knee deep in the Clinton e-mail scandal too! It s what the press doesn t tell you that s important. We just don t know if this is a matter of these people resigning or a matter of our new president recognizing that we need to DRAIN THE SWAMP! COULD THIS BE THE SMOKING GUN THAT TRUMP CALLED OUT ON PATRICK KENNEDY: In what one congressman called the  flashing red light of potential criminality,  FBI documents indicate a senior State Department official offered a  quid pro quo  to get the FBI to remove the  Secret  label from one of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton s emails from the days when she was secretary of state.The documents say State Department Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy, who had served as an aide and confidante to Clinton, offered the deal, and continued trying to influence the FBI s decision by taking his case over the head of FBI agents to whom he initially proposed the deal.FBI documents say Kennedy offered the FBI additional positions overseas if the  Secret  label, the middle level of classification, would be removed. Clinton, who used a private server for her emails while she was secretary of state, has contended she never sent or received classified information. The FBI has ruled otherwise.In response to the FBI bombshell, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump released a video on Twitter in which he said the allegations show  corruption at the highest level.

Trump says he believes block-grant healthcare bill will pass,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he believed Republicans had enough votes to pass a healthcare bill that would allocate block grants to states. As soon as were finished with taxes ... we really feel like we have the votes to get block grants into the states where the states can much better manage this money and much better take care of the people, Trump told reporters.

DEMOCRAT SENATOR Claims Repeal Of Obamacare Based Only on Hatred of Barack Obama [Video],"Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy (Conn.) said Wednesday on MSNBC s  Morning Joe  that Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare are based on the GOP s  hatred of Barack Obama. MSNBC contributor Eddie Glaude asked Murphy what he believes the  animating commitment  behind the GOP health care bill is and what it would take for him to work in a bipartisan way with Republicans to fix the country s health care system. At this point, I think it s clear the animating commitment is a hatred of Barack Obama,  Murphy said.  The policy has been pushed to the wayside here. They don t seem tremendously interested in actually crafting something that insures more people or reduces rates. They just want to fulfill this commitment that they made to repeal Obamacare. Murphy went on to say that he has made it very clear he wants to compromise with Republicans on health care. They want, as far as I can tell, flexibility of benefit design. They want something that has some cheaper premiums, less regulations in these exchanges. I m willing to talk to them about that,  Murphy said.  I m willing to give them some flexibility of benefit design if they re willing to give us some security on these exchanges that Donald Trump won t unwind them. ",0.0
" Trump Spokeswoman Slips Up, Says Trumps Immigration Plan Wont Work (VIDEO)","We are all getting whiplash from Donald Trump s constant flip-flopping on his immigration policy over the last few weeks. Trump had been touting one of the most racist, heartless and problematic solutions to immigration throughout his entire campaign until just a few weeks ago, when he suddenly walked it back and softened his position. That decision confused everyone   and especially angered his equally racist supporters   and Trump has been stuck in a vicious back-and-forth pattern ever since.Last week, Trump said all undocumented immigrants in the U.S. must leave and then get in line to come back to America. This week, he made another  pivot  in his immigration policy, stating that he hasn t ruled out giving some immigrants a path to legalization. When spokesperson Katrina Pierson went on CNN to try to clear things up, it became apparent that everyone in the Trump campaign is confused now.In trying to defend her boss, a struggling Pierson said that it would be impossible for Trump to deport all the undocumented immigrants in America because there could be 2-3 times more immigrants than what the estimates say. Using the usual imaginary statistics that the Trump campaign has become infamous for, she said: We are continuously hearing that there s not 11 million [undocumented immigrants], there could be 20 million, there could be 30 million. This is important because Mr. Trump can t promise to deport every single illegal alien in the country if there s 30 million. While she was speaking, the host noticed that Pierson was absolutely lost and said,  We understand that it s complicated    which only infuriated Pierson and made her raise her voice. But as hard as she tried, Pierson couldn t give any solid reasoning for why Trump s ever-changing policy could work, because the truth is that it won t. The only thing that was cleared up in this interview was the fact that not even Trump s own campaign can keep up with his policy changes.Watch Pierson stumble through this interview below:.@KatrinaPierson on Trump s changing immigration stance: He said from beginning he d be  a negotiator in Congress  https://t.co/G4qVqhxleN  New Day (@NewDay) September 6, 2016Featured image is a screenshot",0.0
"Russia sees Exxon boss, tipped to be Secretary of State, as an old friend","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Soon after the United States imposed sanctions on Moscow in 2014, Russian oil tsar Igor Sechin told a Reuters reporter he would miss three things: exploring U.S. culture, the chance to show his children American landscapes, and riding motor-bikes with Exxon Mobil chief executive Rex Tillerson. Tillerson is now front-runner to be Secretary of State in the cabinet of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, and Russian officials are relishing the prospect of having someone with long-standing ties to Russia as the chief U.S. diplomat. Those same ties  Tillerson has met Russian President Vladimir Putin several times and even received a medal from him  are causing disquiet among some policymakers in Washington, who see the relationships as a potential liability. Few people in Moscow expect that the bitter rifts with Washington, over Syria, Ukraine, and NATOs presence in eastern Europe, will be healed overnight with Tillerson at the State Department. But his emergence as front-runner for the job was seen in Moscow as confirmation the Trump administration would put aside old enmity and do deals with the Kremlin. Trump is expected to name Tillerson, a 64-year-old Texan, as Secretary of State, a source familiar with the situation said on Saturday. Tillerson would join other figures with Russia ties already in the Trump cabinet.    The choice of Tillerson is a sensation, said Alexei Pushkov, a pro-Kremlin lawmaker in the upper house of the Russian parliament. This is a businessmen, by definition a pragmatist, who also has lots of experience working with Russia. Judging by the appointments to the key posts in the administration, Trump wants to see a decisive and strong America, but does not see reasons for conflicts with Russia, Pushkov wrote on Twitter. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was cautious on Tillersons cabinet prospects, saying the appointment had not been confirmed. But he praised his personal qualities. As part of his duties as head of one of the biggest oil companies, he had contacts with our representatives, Peskov, said on a conference call with reporters. He carries out his duties in a highly professional way. Asked about how close Tillerson is to Putin, Peskov said: They had working meetings. Indeed, the president received Mr. Tillerson several times. Though he and Putin know each other, the most important relationship Tillerson forged in Russia is with Sechin, one of Putins closest lieutenants. Tillerson started coming into regular contact with Russian officials when, in January 1998, he was made vice president of an Exxon unit involved in exploration projects in Russia and the former Soviet Union. The flagship project was the Sakhalin 1 offshore project in the Pacific Ocean. Exxon was the operator and Rosneft, the Russian state oil giant headed by Sechin, was a major shareholder. He knows this whole sphere excellently, said an oil executive close to Rosneft and Exxon, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He was involved in the negotiations and the implementation of Sakhalin 1.. From the start. And he knows the peculiarities of the Russian mind-set very well.   In 2012, Rosneft and Exxon deepened their cooperation, signing an agreement on joint development of oil fields in Western Siberia. Putin, Tillerson and Sechin came together for the signing ceremony. Later the same year Zeljko Runje, who until then had been vice president of Exxons Russian operations, moved to Rosneft to take up the post of vice president and member of the management board. Their next big joint project was launched in June 2013, when they set up a joint venture to explore for oil in the Kara Sea, in the Arctic, and in the Black Sea. Sechin and Tillerson both attended the signing ceremony. In the same month, Putin awarded Tillerson the Order of Friendship, a Russian state honor. The citation said it was for his significant contribution to strengthening cooperation in the energy sector.  Then the Ukraine conflict intervened in 2014, testing Tillersons relations with his Russian partners. After Russia annexed Ukraines Crimea region and backed separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, the United States started several rounds of sanctions.  Tillerson, like other U.S. energy CEOs under pressure from the White House, stayed away from an annual investors meeting with Putin in St Petersburg in June. He sent a senior Exxon executive in his place. By August 2014, Exxon was poised to start drilling on the Kara Seas Universitetskaya exploratory well but an imminent fresh round of sanctions could have halted work. According to two offshore drilling sources familiar with the Kara Sea project, Tillerson and his team went into crisis mode. They managed to sign the contract to supply a drilling rig just before one round of sanctions was imposed, giving them some legal breathing space. The Exxon managers then pushed through the drilling program in two months before a further round of sanctions eventually knocked it off course, the sources said. They found large reserves of crude. An Exxon representative was not immediately available for comment. Soon after, obstacles arising from the sanctions forced Exxon to suspend its cooperation with Rosneft in the Kara Sea. The project has since been idling. But Exxons Russian partners remember its effort to get the well drilled. I think his appointment is favorable for Russia, one of the two sources said about Tillerson being lined up for Secretary of State. ",1.0

 Donald War Criminal Rumsfeld Takes A Moment To Remind Us Hes Close To Death (TWEET),"There are some people in life that, if they are wise, will just keep their mouths shut and their voices out of public reach. Donald Rumsfeld is one of those people. Yet, he can t seem to keep his mouth shut on Twitter and likes to continue to remind us of what a horrific human being he is, and should likely really belong in prison.On Monday, Rumsfeld decided to tweet out in regards to tax day:At 83, I am close to losing hope that I will live to see a flat tax.  Donald Rumsfeld (@RumsfeldOffice) April 18, 2016Aww, how terrible for him that a regressive method of taxation will never come to fruition during his lifetime. He apparently isn t done screwing over the American people, and would prefer the wealthy to pay less and the poor to pay more. What a peach.We already knew this guy is a douchebag, though. He s one of the evil assholes who lied to get us into a war with Iraq. A war that has subsequently killed thousands of American soldiers, wounded thousands more, killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians, and gave rise to ISIS (but really, who s keeping track). He knew we didn t have enough intelligence to back claims that there were Weapons of Mass Destruction. Yet, he as the Secretary of Defense under former President George W. Bush, continued to lead the drumbeat towards war.So Rumsfeld, we as pissed off American citizens think your tweet should have probably read  At 83, I am close to losing hope that I will be tried as the war criminal that I am.  And if you go to Twitter and read the replies to his tweet, it seems many, many people agree with that sentiment. Probably not wise for a man who s actions lead to so many deaths to tweet he s close to death himself. Likely not gonna be received too well.He truly is a person who should keep his mouth shut, because if he had kept it shut in the first place, so much worldwide would be different to this day.Featured Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images",0.0
" Tired Of Bigotry, California Enacts Travel Ban To Trump Country","Donald Trump keeps trying and failing to enact a travel ban from many predominantly Muslim countries. California is enacting its own travel ban, but this one, unlike Trump s, will pass constitutional muster and it s to combat bigotry.The state can t tell its citizens that they can t travel to other states, but there is now a ban on state-funded and state-sponsored travel to states that discriminate against LGBTQ people. In other words, states that hate won t get California tax dollars.The ban is a reaction to past and recent legislation that would allow people to discriminate against LGBTQ people wanting to adopt and foster children among other forms of discrimination. The ban currently encompasses eight states.Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Tennessee were the original states banned by AB 1887, but (California Attorney General Xavier) Becerra added Alabama, Kentucky, South Dakota and Texas on Thursday, citing what he called new discriminatory legislation enacted against the LGBTQ community in those states.Alabama, South Dakota, and Texas all recently passed legislation that could prevent LGBT parents from adopting or fostering children and Kentucky passed a religious freedom bill that would allow students to exclude LGBTQ classmates from campus groups. While the California DOJ works to protect the rights of all our people, discriminatory laws in any part of our country send all of us several steps back,  Becerra said.  That s why when California said we would not tolerate discrimination against LGBTQ members of our community, we meant it. Source: CNNNot surprisingly, all of these are Trump states.While the recent spate of hate legislation can t be directly attributed to Donald Trump, there s no doubt he empowered it. Red states are pretty comfortable right now in the knowledge that Trump will pick anti-gay judges to uphold their bigoted agendas.While California in no way prohibits its citizens and even its employees from spending their own money in states like Texas, they don t have to encourage it.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images.",0.0

Desperate Venezuelans peddle wares door-to-door in Colombia to survive,"CUCUTA, Colombia (Reuters) - Thousands of impoverished Venezuelans are crossing the border to Colombia every day to sell cheap basics, from oranges to candles, in a desperate attempt to earn hard currency amid their country s worsening economic collapse. The porous roughly 2,220-kilometer (1,380-mile) frontier for years has been rife with smuggling due to the massive differences in prices on either side due to controls imposed by Venezuela s socialist government.  But in the past three months there has been a spike in Venezuelans migrating to the border area and spending their days going door-to-door trying to sell low-cost goods in Colombia.  Hundreds of vendors are sleeping in the streets of the Venezuelan border town of San Antonio, while the surge in hawkers on the Colombian side is stoking anger among local shopkeepers.  Albert Rodriguez, 22, spends his nights on a plastic sheet in the streets of San Antonio since moving from Venezuela s inland agricultural state of Lara a month ago. He sells coffee in Colombia, but still has not been able to send money home to help his newborn daughter.   It s tough because there are so many Venezuelans. I feel like crying because I am so impotent,  said Rodriguez, who said he hopes to eventually migrate to central Colombia where he thinks job prospects will be better.  The flood of vendors is evidence of how a fourth year of recession - which has fomented malnutrition, disease and violent crime - is tearing Venezuela s social fabric apart.  It also highlights that Colombia, already home to the most Venezuelan migrants in South America, remains particularly vulnerable to the crisis.  The Colombian government did not respond to a request for comment.  Come daybreak, Venezuelan hawkers jostle for hours to get a spot on a bus traveling to the Colombian border. They then cross the teeming frontier on foot, many silently praying that the National Guard will not demand payment to let them through with their goods.  Once safely in Cucuta, the vendors disperse on different buses that take them across the Colombian border city. In the low-income hillside neighborhood of La Libertad, around a hundred Venezuelans rang doorbells offering mayonnaise, insecticide, cereal boxes and more.  Sales are often brisk. Prices are roughly half those in Colombian stores due to Venezuela s depreciated bolivar currency.  Some worried Colombian shopkeepers are demanding the border be closed to protect their businesses. Colombians also at times fret that the influx of Venezuelan vendors could lead to crime.  Marlon Carrillo, a 21-year-old Venezuelan who abandoned university studies to start selling fruit in Colombia three months ago, said some locals slammed doors in his face out of fear.   It s hard to pay for the sins of others,  said Carrillo, who crisscrosses Cucuta for eight hours a day selling the lemons, strawberries, bananas and pineapples he crams into his backpack.   I want to progress and study but I have to work. I m not going to let my family die of hunger,  said Carrillo, who is supporting his three nephews after his sister died of bone marrow failure.  ",1.0
Quake pitches past into present in scarred Mexico City district,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The powerful earthquake that rocked Mexico City last week had terrifying echoes of a more deadly 1985 shock in one housing project, raising tough questions about how ready one of the world s largest cities is for a major catastrophe. At its epicenter, Thursday s 8.1 magnitude quake was stronger than the disaster three decades ago that killed at least 5,000 people in Mexico City, toppling two tower blocks in the historic central neighborhood of Tlatelolco. Mexico City has made major advances since then, with regular earthquake simulations, improved building regulations, and seismic alarms designed to sound long enough before the shock to give residents time to flee. Nearly 100 people are known to have died in the latest quake, none of them in the capital. Yet experts noted the tremor s epicenter was further from Mexico City and two times deeper than in 1985, and warned it would be wrong to assume the capital could now rest easy. Such caution was palpable in Tlatelolco. Antonio Fonseca, 66, a longtime resident who witnessed the 1985 collapse of the tower blocks in the Nuevo Leon housing complex that killed at least 200 people, said memories of the event sparked panic attacks in the neighborhood when the quake rolled through the city on Thursday.  I m quite sure that these buildings are very well reinforced,  said Fonseca, a local history expert.  But there are many people who are still wary.  When the ground began shaking in September 1985, local workers laughed it off at first, continuing with breakfast. Nobody believed Fonseca when he told them Nuevo Leon had fallen, he recalled. Later, Fonseca saw a group of children in the neighborhood s central Plaza de las Tres Culturas who had been waiting for the school bus, their uniforms caked in white dust from the building s collapse.  This time around, residents feared the worst. Streets filled across the city when the quake hit near midnight. Crying and praying, hundreds descended onto the plaza and some stayed for hours, questioning whether it was safe to return home. Minerva de la Paz Uribe, a retiree living on the plaza, was unable to evacuate with her father, who turned 104 the next day. She watched from her window as neighbors scrambled to escape.  People leave running with their dogs. They leave screaming. Are we prepared? No, no, we re not prepared,  she said, as a group of friends on the plaza murmured in agreement. Some 30 buildings in Tlatelolco were rebuilt after the 1985 disaster and a dozen were demolished. Mexico s new skyscrapers include hydraulic shock absorbers and deep foundations. But such safety features are less prevalent in much of the sprawling periphery, which is filled with cheap cinderblock homes like the buildings that collapsed on Thursday in the southern states of Oaxaca and Chiapas near the epicenter. Situated at the intersection of three tectonic plates, Mexico is one of the world s most earthquake-prone countries, and the capital is particularly vulnerable due to its location on top of an ancient lake bed.  The government s widely panned response to the 1985 quake caused upheaval in Mexico, which some credited with weakening the one-party rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). After 71 years, the PRI was finally voted out in 2000. Signs of government incompetence, or worse, persist. Mexican news website Animal Politico on Monday reported that thousands of seismic alarms acquired by the government of Oaxaca five years ago were never distributed, with some appearing for sale on online auction sites. A spokesman for Oaxaca s civil protection authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mistrust of government has spurred some to form community groups. Among the most famous are the Tlatelolco Topos, or moles, formed from rescue squads that dug survivors and corpses out of the rubble in 1985, and have since traveled the world offering assistance in quakes and landslides. But disasters have a habit of catching people off guard. Georgina Mendez de Schaafsma was returning from taking children to school when the 1985 temblor struck Tlatelolco. To her horror, she realized her six-year-old daughter was home alone. Racing back, Mendez retrieved the girl. But three other relatives died in the Nuevo Leon collapses. Now 70, Mendez still lives in the same building, which had a number of floors removed after the 1985 quake. She stayed indoors when the tremors began on Thursday night and believes Mexico City is better equipped today - up to a point.  In a catastrophe, I think we re never prepared,  she said.  Nature is stronger.  ",1.0
German coalition talks deal early blow to Macron on Europe,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German parties exploring a coalition government have dealt an early blow to French President Emmanuel Macron s hopes for more expansive fiscal policies from Berlin, backing a balanced budget and rejecting the idea of a separate pot of cash for the euro zone. The Greens, seen as closest to Macron on economic policy and Europe, appeared to have caved in to demands by Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives and the Free Democrats (FDP) that a new government continue down a path of fiscal discipline. Merkel, whose conservatives placed first but lost seats in an election last month, is trying to forge a coalition with the pro-business FDP and the Greens, which requires bridging disagreements on taxes, immigration and foreign policy. In a joint paper agreed after late-night talks on Tuesday, the parties said they all supported a balanced budget. A senior Greens politician who participated in the talks also told Reuters that the parties were united in opposing Macron s idea for a euro zone budget.  None of the participating parties support a euro zone budget,  said Reinhard Buetikofer, a member of the European Parliament. The parties are expected to reconvene on Thursday to finalize a joint paper on Europe, after agreeing a rough blueprint for fiscal policy late on Tuesday. That blueprint included a pledge to respect  debt brake  legislation enshrined in the constitution since 2009, which forces the federal government to virtually eliminate structural budget deficits, limiting them to 0.35 percent of GDP. It also contained a commitment to provide relief to lower and middle income earners, dismantle the  solidarity tax  for poor eastern states and provide financial incentives to make German homes more energy efficient. Cem Ozdemir, a leader of the Greens who is seen as a possible foreign minister in the new government, highlighted a decision to re-examine plans to raise defence spending by the outgoing  grand coalition  of Merkel s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD), who are moving into opposition. Tax relief and investment needs would be finalised once more details on tax revenues become available next month, Ozdemir said, suggesting that the balanced budget commitment was not final. The Greens politician also said that a new coalition would have to provide a  pro-European  answer to proposals from Macron and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker for closer cooperation in fiscal matters, defence and migration.  There are a lot of differences to overcome. But I am hoping for a clear commitment to Europe,  said Ozdemir in a video posted on the Greens website. Buetikofer said the Greens supported the idea of boosting investment within the framework of the existing EU budget. But their rejection of Macron s idea for a separate budget for the euro zone at such an early stage of the coalition talks was seen by some members of the party as an unnecessary  cave in  to Merkel s conservatives and the FDP. Macron has called for the creation of a euro zone budget of several hundred billions of euros to help the single currency bloc cope with economic shocks. One FDP participant who requested anonymity suggested that the Greens may have given away too much in the talks on Tuesday night and expressed concern that the leadership of the party could be forced to change tack in the days ahead by angry grass roots members. Former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, a Social Democrat who ruled with the Greens for seven years, accused the environmentalist party of  preparing Frau Merkel s bed  in a desperate attempt to re-enter government. Immigration could also be a contentious issue in the coalition talks as Merkel s conservatives row back on the open-door policy towards refugees that she adopted in 2015. This will also be on the agenda on Thursday. ",1.0
"At under $5 each, Trump's votes came cheap","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump pulled off one of the biggest upsets in American political history when he toppled Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday - and he did it using far less cash than his rival.  Relying heavily on an unorthodox mix of social media, unfiltered rhetoric, and a knack for winning free TV time, the New York real estate businessman likely paid less than $5 per vote during his insurgent White House bid, about half what Clinton paid, according to a Reuters analysis of campaign finance records and voting data. Those figures assume the candidates spent all the funds they raised.  Trumps cost-effective win has upended prevailing concepts about the influence of money in American politics and raised the question of whether a lean, media-savvy campaign can become the new model for winning office in the United States.  Political strategists and academics tend to agree, however, that Trumps performance would be tough to repeat.A household name for his luxury brand resorts, reality TV stardom, and ability to surround himself with non-stop controversy, Trump held advantages that many political candidates lack.  I think this is a case where Trump had unique characteristics as a candidate that allowed him to pursue a different type of strategy, said Tony Corrado, a professor of government at Colby College in Maine.  In total, Trump raised at least $270 million since launching his campaign in June 2015, a little more than a third of the money that Obamas re-election campaign spent in 2012, according to the most recent filings with the Federal Elections Commission.  With vote counting wrapping up in the early hours of Wednesday, Trump had won some 59 million votes nationwide in the general election. That amounts to less than $5 per vote for the $270 million he spent.     According to data analytics firm mediaQuant, Trump garnered about $5 billion worth of free media coverage during the election campaign, more than twice the amount earned by Clinton, a lifelong politician who served as secretary of state, senator, and first lady at different times in her career. mediaQuant adds up all the unpaid coverage the candidates earn in newspapers, magazines and social media and then compares the sum to what a comparable amount of coverage, with the same kind of reach, would have cost in advertising.  Trump has also frequently dominated news cycles with provocative rhetoric that breaks taboos, including unabashed insults targeting women he dislikes over Twitter, or unusual policy proscriptions like his call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country to prevent domestic attacks, or to force Mexico to pay for a multi-billion dollar border wall to keep out immigrants. Trump made his self-funding a selling point early in his campaign as he fended off 16 Republican rivals for the party nomination, arguing that by eschewing big donors he was not beholden to special interests.  But once he secured the nomination, Trump changed course and began fundraising in earnest, replicating the small dollar fundraising juggernaut of another insurgent candidate, Democrat Bernie Sanders, along the way.     Clinton raised at least $521 million, according to filings.  The former secretary of state stuck to the more traditional campaigning model of launching expensive television ads and funding hundreds of staffers who fanned across the country to work to increase voter turnout on Election Day.  She spent more than $237 million on television ads and more than $42 million on hundreds of staffers.  She also benefited from spending by the Super PACs supporting her candidacy, which are allowed to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money but cannot coordinate directly with the campaign. More than a dozen people, including hedge fund magnate Donald Sussman and global financier George Soros,wrote multi-million checks to Priorities USA, the primary PAC supporting her campaign, according to filings.  Michael Traugott, a political science professor at the University of Michigan, said the traditional U.S. model for picking presidents might seem odd to people in other nations, where campaigns are shorter and require less cash.  The system is clearly broken, Traugott said. ",1.0
All eyes on the 'Crocodile' as Zimbabwe's Mugabe resigns,"HARARE (Reuters) - When Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe sacked his vice president in front of 12,000 baying party members in 2014, Emmerson Mnangagwa sat quietly in the crowd, a green baseball cap pulled low over his eyes. The man who stood to gain most from the dismissal betrayed nothing through his expression and gentle clapping - a survival tactic honed during five decades of service to the mercurial Mugabe. His cap, however, spoke volumes. Emblazoned across its front, next to a portrait of Mugabe, were four words:  Indigenise, Empower, Develop, Employ  - a slogan of the ruling ZANU-PF party. That day, he became Mugabe s official deputy. Mnangagwa, whose sacking from the post this month brought Zimbabwe s political crisis to a head, is now poised to take over after Mugabe, 93, resigned on Tuesday, ending almost four decades of rule. Mnangagwa will be sworn in on Wednesday or Thursday, ZANU-PF s legal secretary Patrick Chinamasa told Reuters. The party s chief whip said Mnangagwa would serve the remainder of Mugabe s term until the next election due by September 2018. But there are questions over how Mnangagwa will lead the country led by Mugabe since independence in 1980. In a statement issued from hiding on Tuesday, Mnangagwa said Zimbabweans from all walks of life had to work together to rebuild a shattered economy and deeply polarized society.  My desire is to join all Zimbabweans in a new era, where corruption, incompetence, dereliction of duty and laziness, social and cultural decadence is not tolerated,  he said.  In that new Zimbabwe, it is important for everyone to join hands so that we rebuild this nation to its full glory. This is not a job for ZANU-PF alone but for all people of Zimbabwe.  The 75-year-old was one of Mugabe s most trusted lieutenants, having been at his side in prison, during wartime and then in government. With his appointment in 2014 as Mugabe s official deputy, Mnangagwa had appeared well set as the eventual successor to Africa s oldest head of state.  There are no arguments around his credentials to provide strong leadership and stability, but there are questions over whether he can also be a democrat,  said Eldred Masunungure, a political science lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe. Speaking at the congress in 2014, Mnangagwa reinforced the message emblazoned on his headgear, announcing revisions to ZANU-PF s constitution that backed  total ownership and control  of Zimbabwe s natural resources. It was a key insight to the party s direction as it contemplated life beyond Mugabe.  We will remain forever masters of our own destiny,  Mnangagwa said at the time, to cheers from the crowd. Along the way, Mnangagwa earned the nickname  Ngwena , Shona for crocodile, an animal famed in Zimbabwean lore for its stealth and ruthlessness. He backed Mugabe s economic nationalism, especially a drive to force foreign firms to hand majority stakes to local blacks, suggesting he may not be the pro-market pragmatist many investors were hoping for. He has been in every administration since independence, holding posts as varied as minister of state security, defense and finance, as well as speaker of parliament. Most controversially, he was in charge of internal security in the mid-1980s when Mugabe deployed a crack North Korean-trained brigade against rebels loyal to his rival Joshua Nkomo. Rights groups say 20,000 civilians, mostly from the Ndebele tribe, were killed. Mugabe denies genocide or crimes against humanity but has admitted it was a  moment of madness . Mnangagwa s role remains shrouded in mystery, typical of a political operator trained as a communist guerrilla in China in the 1960s and who always stayed in the shadows behind Mugabe. Secretive and insular, he prefers to operate under the radar, those in his inner circle say, and when pushed into a corner, resorts to jokes and trivia to avoid serious discussion.  I wouldn t say he is deceptive but it s fair to say his default position is to crack jokes and deflect uncomfortable questions by asking endless questions,  one member of parliament close to him said.  He is very conscious that his public image is that of a hard man but he is a much more complex personality - pleasant and an amazing story-teller,  the politician, also from Mnangagwa s Midlands Province, told Reuters. Mnangagwa s appointment as vice president came a day after his predecessor Joice Mujuru was fired for allegedly planning to topple Mugabe. Asked whether the purge would weaken the party, a smiling Mnangagwa said:  The revolution has a way of strengthening itself. It goes through cycles, this is another cycle where it rids itself of elements that had now become inconsistent with the correct line.  Mnangagwa learnt his politics in prison in the 1960s after being sentenced to death for sabotage by British authorities. He was captured while in one of the earliest guerrilla units fighting white colonial rule in what was then Rhodesia. He was 19 and only spared the noose by a law prohibiting the execution of convicts under 21. After a decade in prison, often sharing a cell with Mugabe, Mnangagwa became personal assistant to the leader of the liberation struggle, and went on to head the guerrilla movement s feared internal security bureau. In January, a photograph appeared in local media showing Mnangagwa enjoying drinks with a friend. In his hand was a large novelty mug emblazoned with the words:  I M THE BOSS.  To supporters of Mugabe, this bordered on treason. They suspected that Mnangagwa already saw himself in the leader s shoes. When Mugabe fired Mnangagwa as vice president this month for showing  traits of disloyalty , he removed a possible successor who was also one of his last remaining liberation war comrades. But relations had already cooled between the two men after suggestions by Mnangagwa s allies in August that he had been poisoned by ice cream from a dairy owned by the Mugabes. ",1.0
U.S. State Dept keeps hiring freeze as Tillerson looks to downsize,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has maintained a hiring freeze at the State Department even though it was lifted for the rest of the federal government, a spokesman said on Thursday, as the agency begins to downsize before Congress approves funding cuts.  Acting State Department spokesman Mark Toner confirmed that the hiring freeze would remain until the plan to downsize and reorganize had been fully developed. He could not give a timeline for the reorganization. We cant be onboarding people when we dont know what our reorganization is going to ultimately look like, Toner told a briefing for reporters. Trumps budget proposal for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 would cut 28 percent of the budget for U.S. diplomacy and foreign aid. Republicans and Democrats in Congress, which approves the budget, have rejected the prospect of such cuts. It was not known whether the White House directed Tillerson to keep the hiring freeze in place for the State Department or whether other agencies would also refuse to lift the hiring ban. Two State Department officials said Tillerson plans to downsize staff over a period of two to three years. Tillerson informed State Department employees of the decision on Wednesday, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. While Trumps original hiring freeze notice on Jan. 23 excluded political appointees, it has stopped the hiring of rank-and-file workers and the replacement of others who have resigned or retired. William Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington-based think tank, said the Trump administration may have to seek congressional approval if the hiring freeze changes the function of programs congress explicitly voted to fund.  Hoagland said the administration would have to send what is known as an impoundment resolution if the State Department jeopardizes what that agency is there to begin with by not filling positions that are vacated. Congress would then have to approve the resolution, Hoagland said.  The State Departments Toner said Tillerson was not breaking any federal rule by maintaining the hiring freeze.  My understanding is that (Tillerson) has the jurisdiction to keep this freeze in place as we go about this presidentially-mandated reorganization, Toner said.  The Office of Management and Budget, which handles federal budgeting, did not respond to a request for comment.     Trumps budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters on Tuesday that the hiring freeze would be lifted but that agencies will be asked to remain mindful of Trumps goal to reduce the federal work force. Tillerson said in March that the State Departments current spending was simply not sustainable.     ",1.0
"Eyeing an Indiana victory, Trump says, 'It's over'","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Front-runner Donald Trump said on Sunday that he will have essentially sealed the Republican U.S. presidential nomination if he wins Tuesdays contest in Indiana, where he holds a big lead over chief rival Ted Cruz. A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist opinion poll showed Trump with a wide lead in Indiana, 49 percent to 34 percent for Cruz and 13 percent for a third candidate, Ohio Governor John Kasich. Trump, a 69-year-old billionaire real estate developer, sounded confident in an interview on Fox News Sunday when asked whether Indiana would basically end the long-running Republican race in his favor. Yes, its over, Trump said. Its already over. The poll showed the depth of the challenge facing Cruz, a conservative U.S. senator from Texas who is trying to prevent Trump from winning the 1,237 delegates needed to seal the nomination.  Cruzs hopes rest on emerging as a consensus alternative to Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland on July 18-21. Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 68, leads U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, 74, of Vermont in the race for the Democratic nomination. On NBCs Meet the Press, Cruz, 45, was asked several times whether he would support Trump if the New York businessman was the Republican nominee. Cruz evaded the question each time and turned the questions into an attack on broadcast media. I recognize that many in the media would love to see me surrender to Donald Trump because that means that Hillary wins. The media has given $2 billion in free advertising to Donald Trump, Cruz said. Cruz said he has momentum in Indiana based on his choice of former candidate Carly Fiorina for his vice president and Fridays endorsement by Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Americans will elect a successor to President Barack Obama on Nov. 8. Trump, who has amassed 996 delegates, according to an Associated Press count, has momentum behind him and looks increasingly likely to win the nomination outright, without a contested convention, perhaps when California votes on June 7. Indiana has 57 Republican delegates. Three are awarded from each of the states nine U.S. congressional districts with the candidate who receives the most votes taking them all. The 30 others are awarded to the candidate who wins the most votes statewide. At a rally in Terre Haute, Indiana, Trump urged Republicans to join his movement and turn out for him in big numbers. The more we can win by in Indiana is so important. Its a mandate ... a really important mandate. Its a mandate for change, but not Obama change. Real change. Its a mandate for genius, he said. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a leading Republican critic of Trump, called him the most unelectable person the party could nominate. Graham had sought the nomination himself. Keep fighting Ted, Graham told CBSs Face the Nation. On the Democratic side, front-runner Clinton told CNNs State of the Union that rival Bernie Sanders has been helpful in bringing millions of people into the partys presidential race, but it was time for him to step aside. There comes a time when you have to look at the reality, said Clinton, who won four of the five Northeastern states that voted last Tuesday and who has a big lead in the delegate race ahead of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 25-28. But at a news conference in Washington, Sanders refused to get out, saying he believes the Democratic battle will end up in a contested convention. Sanders said it was nearly impossible for Clinton to win the 2,383 delegates needed for nomination without superdelegates, who are unelected and free to support any candidate they wish. We intend to fight for every vote and delegate remaining, he said. Clinton has 2,165 to Sanders 1,357 delegates, according to an AP count that includes superdelegates who have said whom they support. In his Fox interview, Trump defended at length his views on foreign policy, which he outlined in a speech last week in Washington that drew criticism for sometimes contradictory views. Trump said he would move quickly to destroy Islamic States militancy, but would resist interventionist policies in order to focus on nation-building at home. Trump said every move we made in the Middle East was wrong over the past 15 years, with lives and money wasted. He said he would resist such policies. Asked whether the United States should return to working with strongmen leaders like the late Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Trump said: Isnt it too bad that we knocked him out in the first place?

Factbox: Key Republicans in U.S. Senate tax bill fight,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Six more U.S. senators signed on to support a sweeping Republican tax bill on Friday, leaving only one known Republican opponent - Bob Corker - and virtually assuring the measure would pass despite Democratic opposition. A vote was expected later Friday. Here are the Republican senators who have been pivotal to the bills fate. Corker, a deficit hawk from Tennessee, said on Friday he could not vote for the Senate legislation because of fiscal concerns. In a statement, he said he believed the tax overhaul could deepen the debt burden on future generations. Corker had stalled momentum on the tax bill on Thursday by demanding Republicans look for more ways to keep the bill from causing the U.S. deficit to balloon. He said Friday he felt it would have been fairly easy to alter the measure in a way that would have been more fiscally sound, but unfortunately, it is clear that the (Republican) caucus is in a different place. However, Corker said he had told President Donald Trump in a phone call Friday that he would take a close look at the final version of the bill, expected to be produced by a House-Senate conference, before deciding how to vote on it. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated on Thursday that the Republican bill would expand the national debt by $1 trillion over 10 years, far short of assertions by Republicans that the tax cuts would pay for themselves. The moderate senator from Maine announced Friday she will support the tax bill after securing several improvements in the text and getting assurances that other legislation would be advanced to help lower health insurance premiums. Collins dislikes a clause in the bill repealing a fee imposed on people who do not comply with Obamacares individual mandate to obtain health insurance. She said she worried that repealing this fee would drive up insurance premium costs, canceling out gains from tax cuts that many constituents might get from the bill. She said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had pledged to help mitigate the effect of the repeal by supporting passage of two other healthcare bills before the end of the year. One would help insurers cover expensive patients; the other would continue Obamacare subsidy payments for low-income people for two years. Collins also got three amendments included in the tax bill, including one to keep the state and local property tax deduction of up to $10,000 from federal income tax. This would mirror legislation already passed by the House of Representatives. The Montana Republican signed on to support the bill Friday after having voiced concerns about its treatment of Main Street businesses. He said he had won more tax relief for non-corporate pass-through businesses, which include partnerships, sole proprietorships and other non-corporate enterprises. The senator from Wisconsin endorsed the bill after  demanding more for pass-throughs. The bill now features a 23 percent tax deduction for such business owners, up from the original 17.4 percent, said statements from Daines and Johnson. The Arizona conservative announced in a statement on Friday he would vote for the bill. He said he had succeeded in eliminating an $85 billion expensing budget gimmick and received a firm commitment from Senate leaders and the Trump administration to work on permanent protections for immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children.  Oklahomas Lankford came aboard on Friday after having questioned whether tax revenues from economic growth would compensate for an expected increase in the national debt. He announced on Friday he was voting for the bill. Moran had earlier been wary of its impact on the debt.  The Arizona maverick and former presidential candidate announced on Thursday that he would back the tax bill. The senator from Alaska will vote for the tax bill, she wrote on Twitter on Wednesday evening. ",1.0
SOMALI IMMIGRANT Charged With Multiple Stabbings At Mall of America Has Interesting Meaning Behind His Islamic Name,"Minnesota is home to the largest number of Somali immigrants in America.  Census numbers put the state s Somali s population at about 40,000, but community activists have said it s higher. The largest share of that group has settled in the Minneapolis area, including one neighborhood near the University of Minnesota campus that s been dubbed  Little Mogadishu.  But significant numbers have also settled in St. Cloud, Willmar and other smaller cities.Being home to the largest number of Somali immigrants in America doesn t come without a price WND   For the second time in just over a year, a Somali  refugee  has stabbed shoppers with a knife at a Minnesota mall.The first case, on Sept. 17, 2016, was a clear act of jihad when Dahir Adan injured 10 people in the Macy s at the Crossroads Center Mall in St. Cloud after asking his victims, chosen at random, if they were Muslim.But on Sunday night a man identified as Mahad Abdiaziz Abdirahman, 20, of Minneapolis stabbed two men at the Mall of America after they tried to stop him from stealing clothes inside the dressing room at Macy s.His middle name, Abdiaziz, means  the slave of Allah the master,  a native Arabic speaker told WND.His first name, Mahad, means  the one who preaches and invites people to Islam. Wow! Talk about the perfect ambassdor for Islam According to the NYP, Abdirahaman sneaked into a men s fitting room at the Minnesota mall and tried to swipe something from a customer s belongings while the man was outside the fitting room modeling clothes for his family. But he caught Abdirahaman in the act, and the would-be thief pulled a knife and stabbed him, authorities said.Hearing the victim s screams, his family rushed to his aid, but Abdirahaman slashed a second person before they could wrest the knife from him.The scuffle and ensuing response by police freaked out nearby shoppers waiting in line for their kids to see Santa.Violence by Somali immigrants against Minneapolis residents is nothing new to people who have watched the Somali population explode in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.Last year, we reported about a mob of up to 30 young Somali men paraded through one of Minneapolis  more upscale neighborhoods last week, yelling disparaging comments and threats against homeowners.A female resident of the neighborhood, obviously shaken in a TV interview, related how she was screamed at by a Somali man who threatened to kidnap and rape her. They were screaming at the house that they were going to kidnap you and they were going to rape you,  one Minneapolis resident told KSTP TV.  It was a very traumatizing experience. Somalis living in Minneapolis are almost all Sunni Muslims, and residents of the Lake Calhoun area say this isn t the first time a group of Somali men has made an intimidating march through their neighborhood, which is filled with million-dollar homes.Go HERE for video to see homeowner tell her horrifying story.

 Right-Wing Terrorist Found With Shrapnel-Filled Bombs Has A Facebook Page Filled With Crazy (VIDEO),"The Republican Party has spent more than seven years pushing anti-government ideas. After President Obama was elected in 2008, there was an explosion of right-wing domestic terror organizations in the USA. The Southern Poverty Law Center released a study that found these organizations experienced an eightfold growth from 2008 (149 groups) to 2012 s 1,360 radical militias. A young man in Tampa, Florida belonged to one of these  patriotic  militias and now he is in jail   for making bombs.A potential right-wing terrorist was arrested this week after his business partner reported that he d seen bombs inside his house. Kenneth Ray O Neill recently went to his partner Michael Ramos  home and saw a crate with about half a dozen pipe bombs in it. Ramos, who s a member of the United States Patriot Army,  told O Neill that he made the bombs from materials purchased on Amazon with his girlfriend s credit card. According to Fox 13 News:Ramos said he made the  black powder  filler with supplies and chemicals purchased from Amazon.com, then added  bird shot  to the powder. Written in the affidavit, Ramos said  it would kill the neighbors if one of the bombs went off. O Neill told police that he warned Ramos that if he did not get rid of the bombs, he was going to go to the police. Ramos became hostile when his partner and his brother, Ryan O Neill, issued the ultimatum. According to Kenneth, Ramos was standing next to an AK-47 assault rifle when the conversation took place. Ryan calmed Ramos down and the brothers left   that s when the authorities were informed.On Monday search warrants were executed on the  patriot s  home and agents found eight pipe bombs, tear gas and smoke grenades. They also found the AK-47, a pistol and a large quantity of ammo.After his arrest Ramos told police that he had the bombs for preparedness/protective  reasons.A look at Ramos  Facebook and you can see that he is clearly a nutjob: I m sure he s totally harmless and just needs security. Right.This is a common excuse among the insane right. They claim that they stockpile weapons because they need to protect themselves, but it s not exactly clear who they are protecting themselves from. If it s from Obama you have to wonder why? It s been seven years since he was elected to office and he has tried exactly zero times to take over the world and confiscate their guns.I imagine it is really hard to walk through life with so much fear .and stupidity. Thankfully, Ramos  business partner did the right thing and contacted police before someone was hurt. Featured image from Facebook",0.0
Melania's Slovenian hometown eyes Trump win as boon for tourism,"SEVNICA, Slovenia (Reuters) - The small Slovenian town of Sevnica, Melania Trumps birthplace, savored her husbands shock win in the U.S. election as a likely boon for tourism on Wednesday, while a former schoolmate remembered her as creative and innovative. Until about a year ago, the town of fewer than 5,000 people, nestled in the foothills of the Alps, was scarcely known in Slovenia, let alone abroad.   But on Monday, Sevnica was clearly looking forward to a financial spin-off from being the hometown of the 46-year-old future U.S. First Lady. Sometimes the pressure of the media was too hard. The people of Sevnica are not used to it. On the other hand, the global attention is positive because Sevnica is developing into a tourist destination, mayor Srecko Ocvirk said. Speaking to Reuters shortly after 7 a.m. (0600 GMT) in Sevnicas Central cafe, the smiling mayor said local residents had supported Trump and his wifes campaign. We are very satisfied at the result, he said. Born Melania Knavs in 1970, she lived in an apartment block in Sevnica with her family as a child. When she was a teenager, the family moved to a modest two-storey house above the Sava river on the outskirts of town, which sits below a well-maintained medieval castle. Residents say her father sold car parts and her mother worked for a factory that made a brand of childrens clothing very popular in communist Yugoslavia, before the country fell apart in the 1990s. Melanias modeling career took her to Milan and thence to the United States, far away from her native Slovenia, a tiny former Yugoslav republic of 2 million people comparable in size to New Jersey. Even as a child Melania was creative, innovative and Sevnica was too small for her, said Mirjana Jelancic, Melanias friend who is now a headmistress of Melanias elementary school. She was reserved and when I heard that Donald was running I said (to myself) this will be hard for her. She never wanted to be in the spotlight, Jelancic said. She was excellent at her job (in the campaign). The head of the towns health center, which received a donation from Melania in 2005 when she was pregnant with her son Barron, said she believed Melania would be a success in the White House, as well. Melania will be an excellent First Lady who will take Slovenian values of generosity, loyalty and trust to the United States and the world, Vladimira Tomsic said.   ",1.0
THREE THEORIES On Why FBIs Comey Reopened Clinton Email ProbeWhy Now?,"NBC reports:The FBI is reviewing a new batch of Hillary Clinton emails, bureau director James Comey said in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday: In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation   I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation,  he wrote.The very first thing to note is that Comey made no mention of a grand jury. The emails whose existence he learned of may have been the result of a subpoena in another investigation (Anthony Weiner). It was announced ten days ago that grand jury would be convened to investigate Weiner s sexting  by the end of the month.  The timing of Comey s letter strongly suggests that the devices containing new emails were obtained through a grand jury subpoena, with no immunity deals or evidence destruction needed. If that is the case, further subpoenas are quite possible, a tool that was left unused in the investigation to date.There are 3 competing theories as to why he might be doing this now that come to mind. He might be seeking to restore his badly damaged reputation, recognizing that the damage he has inflicted on the FBI is substantial. Three days ago, American Thinker published an open letter from a retired FBI Agent, Hugh Galyean, that laid out some of the damage Comey has inflicted on the institution he leads. There is little doubt that this reached many in the FBI family, putting in print what people have only whispered about. If those silenced voices start speaking out, Comey could face a serious loss of face. In this scenario, he is heading off a staff rebellion, possibly including mass resignations.  Rush Limbaugh today discussed an alternative theory, that by announcing an FBI Investigation resuming, Comey is putting a lid on further attention to Wikileaks. I guess this means that Clinton forces will argue we must wait for the investigation to be complete (after the election) before speaking about what the evil Russians are planting into our politics.  It is possible that something so dramatic came up in the pertinent emails that postponing a public reaction by not announcing the reopening of the investigation would, be regarded as political interference by covering up a smoking gun until after the election. In this scenario, Comey is assuming the evidence cannot be suppressed, and that he would be held accountable after it comes out.This scenario also indicates that we could be headed for a constitutional crisis, involving the possible indictment of a president-elect before an election. Or the evidence being turned over to the House of Representatives for impeachment hearings. Read more: American Thinker",0.0

Eastern Congo rebels aim to march on Kinshasa: spokesman,"GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - A rebel spokesman in eastern Congo said on Friday that his movement intended to march across the country to the capital Kinshasa to depose President Joseph Kabila, who refused to quit power at the end of his mandate last year. Led by self-proclaimed  general  William Yakutumba, the rebel force, calling itself the National People s Coalition for the Sovereignty of Congo (CNPSC), has emerged as one of the strongest groups in Democratic Republic of Congo s lawless eastern borderlands since its formation in June. Analysts doubt that the CNPSC has the capacity to make a move on the capital. However it briefly captured some strategic towns in June and advanced this week to within a few kilometers of the city of Uvira along Lake Tanganyika, forcing U.N. helicopters to intervene to help Congolese troops drive them back. Congo has been beset by a wave of prison breaks, rebellions and lawlessness since Kabila s refusal to step down in December.   We are even going to reach Kinshasa,  Dalton Waubwela  Mwila, secretary-general of the CNPSC, told Reuters in a telephone interview.  Our ultimate objective is to be in Kinshasa.   Kabila s father, Laurent, came to power in 1997 on the back of a rebellion that started in eastern Congo, marching the more than 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) to the capital, but he crucially received backing from the armies of neighbouring Rwanda and Uganda.     Waubwela said that the CNPSC includes a number of armed groups in eastern Congo, including in its home province of South Kivu and the neighbouring provinces of North Kivu, Tanganyika and Maniema, where heavy fighting was also reported this week.  Yakutumba formed a militia bearing his name in 2007 and established himself as a warlord, gold smuggler and arms trafficker in South Kivu s Fizi territory, but looks to be trying to raise an insurrection with nationwide support.     Regional wars in eastern Congo, which holds vast reserves of gold, tin, coltan and other minerals, between 1996-2003 killed millions and spawned dozens of armed groups that continue to exploit natural resources and prey on local populations.    Waubwela claimed that the coalition includes more than 10,000 men, but analysts estimate the size of the militia at closer to 300-450, and say it would require significant foreign backing or fresh alliances to be able to occupy much territory, let alone threaten Kabila in Kinshasa.  Waubwela said the rebels have armed themselves with weapons captured from Congolese forces. Speaking to reporters in the eastern city of Goma on Thursday, the army s top general, Didier Etumba, dismissed the CNPSC as a  flash in the pan  that the army would  put out .  But the rebellion is yet another security headache for Kabila, who is also trying to tame a brutal insurgency in central Congo s Kasai region, which has killed up to 5,000 people and displaced 1.4 million more in the past year.

Iran re-opens border crossing with Iraqi Kurdistan region: state media,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iran opened a border crossing with the Kurdistan region of Iraq Wednesday after having closed it following last month s vote in favor of independence in the Kurdish area, Iranian state media reported. Iran backs the Shi ite-led central government in Baghdad in its opposition to Kurdish secession, and Iranian-backed militias assisted government forces when they seized a number of Kurdish cities last week.   The decision comes on the same day as the Kurdish Regional Government offered to put their independence drive on hold, stepping up efforts to resolve a crisis in relations with Baghdad via dialogue rather than military means.  After the referendum and changes within the Kurdistan region our borders with the Kurdistan region of Iraq were closed... today the Bashmagh border is open,  Jahangir Bakhshi, the head of customs for the border crossing, said, according to the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) news agency. The report made no mention the KRG s offer for resolving the dispute through talks. The Bashmagh border crossing is located approximately 50 kilometers (31 miles) east of the city of Sulaimaniya in Iraqi Kurdistan. Last week, Iraqi security forces took control of several cities, including the oil-rich Kirkuk, from Kurdish forces in a lightning assault. Shi ite fighters from the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), many of whom have been armed and trained by Iran, took part in the military action. Prior to the assault, Major-General Qassem Soleimani, commander of foreign operations for Iran s elite Revolutionary Guards, traveled to Iraq s Kurdistan region to encourage Kurdish leaders to withdraw their forces, known as Peshmerga, from Kirkuk. Peshmerga commanders have accused Iran of orchestrating the operation, a charge Iranian officials have denied. Bakshi said on Wednesday that it was not clear when the other borders points between Iran and the Kurdistan region of Iraq would reopen. There is approximately 20 billion dollars of annual cross border trade through the Bashmagh border point Bakhshi said, according to IRIB. ",1.0

'Rage against the machine': U.S. voters reject a 'rigged' system," (This November 9th story has been refiled to clarify that Keyes comment in 3rd paragraph from end was said in jest) By Andy Sullivan and Michelle Conlin WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a bitterly divisive presidential election, at least one thing united U.S. voters: a feeling that the countrys economic and political systems were tilted against them. A Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll of 45,000 voters found an electorate burning with resentment against Wall Street, politicians and the news media, increasingly alienated from a country that is changing in ways it doesnt like. This sense of alienation transcended partisan boundaries, uniting supporters of Republican victor Donald Trump and his  Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. This is rage against the machine, said Carrie Sheridan, a former supporter of Democratic President Barack Obama, as fellow Trump supporters celebrated the real-estate moguls victory early Wednesday by pouring champagne on each other at his $200 million luxury hotel near the White House. Some 75 percent of poll respondents, Republicans and Democrats alike, agreed that the country needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful.  Seven out of ten agreed that the economy is rigged to benefit wealthy insiders. Most backed the notion that their leaders were out of touch: 77 percent of Trump supporters and 56 percent of Clinton supporters agreed that traditional politicians didnt care about people like them. (Graphic of Reuters/Ipsos poll: tmsnrt.rs/2ffJJ9A)  This sense of disconnection ran deepest among Trump supporters. Some 73 percent agreed with the idea that more and more, I dont identify with what America has become, while 61 percent said they felt like strangers in their own country. Most Clinton supporters said they didnt share those sentiments. Nine out of ten Trump supporters said mainstream media is more interested in making money than telling the truth.  Trump, who travels in his own 757 jet, might seem like an unlikely candidate to benefit from this anti-elite sentiment.  But by 8 p.m. Eastern time, lines had formed at the velvet ropes by 8 p.m. Eastern time outside Trumps new hotel in between the White House and the U.S. Capitol, where a steak costs $60 and wine is sold by the spoonful.  These are shadow voters, voters who have never voted before, said Preston Parry, 20, who was watching the results with a throng of friends, all of them wearing suits and Trump campaign trucker hats. Despite his gilded lifestyle, Trump capitalized on working-class fears of a rapidly changing country. Styling himself as a blue-collar billionaire, he promised to bring back manufacturing jobs back to forgotten factory towns and sharply curtail immigration.  He drew overwhelming support from white working-class voters in Rust Belt states like Ohio and Pennsylvania, winning enough states to capture the White House even as he lost the popular vote. Trumps scathing characterization of Clinton as a corrupt career politician also resonated in an year when many voters said they were primarily casting a vote against one of the candidates. Some 46 percent of Trump supporters said they backed him because they didnt want Clinton to win, while 40 percent of Clinton supporters said they were motivated primarily to stop Trump from reaching the White House.  Those who made up their minds in the last week of the campaign were more likely to cite opposition to one of the candidates as their main reason for voting. Politicians like Clinton are taking away from what we were as a country and saying we should change because of the people coming in, the immigrants and refugees, said John Scherer, a 57-year-old former maintenance worker in Portsmouth, Ohio. Scherers sentiments were widely shared by Trump supporters, as 72 percent agreed with the idea that immigrants threaten traditional American beliefs and customs. Three-quarters of Clinton backers, by contrast, said immigrants strengthened U.S. society. The Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states, including more than 45,000 people who already voted in the presidential election. Voter dissatisfaction isnt exactly new. Surveys have consistently found since 2002 that most people believe the country is on the wrong track, a period that encompasses a Republican and Democratic president, two wars, a deep recession and a slow recovery. Trump supporters were more likely to share this frustration. Some 70 percent who backed the Republican real-estate mogul said they felt the country was on the wrong track, while only 23 percent of Clinton supporters agreed, according to the Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll. Those figures could quickly turn on their head as the reality of a Trump presidency sinks in. Across the country, Clinton supporters used unusually harsh language when describing the election result.  In Washington, D.C., non-profit manager Trisha Postyuk said she saw her vote for Clinton as a triumph over evil.  In St. Petersburg, Florida, cafe owner Amanda Keyes, 33, said racist and sexist attitudes are going to take many years to overcome. Misogyny will continue to bubble through the country but I can only hope that the old people will die, she said jokingly. At Trumps hotel, a couple from Atlanta looked at a text message from a friend who had bet them $100 that Trump would lose.  Please dont ever text me again, the message said.     ",1.0
 Trump Went To Japan And Immediately Proved He Knows Zilch About How Missiles Work,"Who knew that Donald Trump would humiliate himself and us as soon as humanly possible with his trip to Asia? There was really no way to know that   this is one of the smartest men on the planet oh wait. This is Donald Trump. And in discussing North Korea s decision to fire ballistic missiles over Japan, he wondered why Japan didn t just shoot those missiles down.That, in turn, shows a complete and total lack of knowledge about how missiles work, about even our own military s capabilities, and about the optics of such an endeavor on ours and Japan s part. First off, it would have been extremely difficult for Japan to shoot them down due to their altitude and speed. Japan does have missile interceptors, but North Korea s missiles were very likely out of range.Then there are the optics: Japan would have been embarrassed alongside us. Our own capabilities to shoot down missiles are also limited, and tests on both systems have failed consistently. Watching us and Japan embarrass ourselves would have emboldened North Korea because it would have told them that we can t stop their missiles. An emboldened North Korea is the last thing the world needs right now.But that s not all. Trump also insulted all of Japan by saying that he couldn t understand why a country full of samurai warriors wouldn t want to shoot down North Korea s missiles. While the samurai are a part of Japan s long and rich history, Trump calling them  a nation of samurai warriors  just reinforces the rest of the world s belief that Americans are too stupid and too arrogant to bother learning about anyone else, and would rather just fall back on ethnic stereotypes.These remarks took place well before Trump actually headed to Japan; however, the news of it came out as he was en route. So, just like every other international trip on which the walking racist presidential impostor has gone, we have been embarrassed on the world stage.

REEBOK JOINS The Lefts War Against President TrumpBerates Him On Twitter For Complimenting French President Macrons Wife,"Brigitte Macron is 24 years older than her husband. She is 64-years old and is in great shape for a woman of her age. As a female, who is younger than Mrs. Macron, I would be thrilled if the most powerful man in the world shook my hand and offered me a sincere compliment about what  great shape  I was in. Mrs. Macron didn t likely wake up one morning and decide she wanted to be a stunning 64-year old woman. She likely had to work at it. Being a 64-year old woman who is married to a charismatic 39-year old man, who is also the newly elected leader of France is probably not that easy. She likely has a rigorous workout schedule, and if she is like most women, she appreciates it when someone notices how hard she works to stay in  great shape.  It is possible that Macron has simply been gifted with great genes and does nothing at all to stay in  great shape , but either way, a compliment about her appearance was likely appreciated by the 64-year old stunner. The Daily Mail ran a wildly popular article in May about Brigitte Macron titled:How DOES Macron s wife defy her age? Experts claim hair extensions, veneers, designer style and some very subtle cosmetic surgery keep Brigitte Trogneux, 64, looking so youthfulHmmm We don t remember the outrage from the media over the Daily Mail article that explored every possibility that could explain Macron s age-defying look, that ran just prior to France s election. There will, of course, always be critics. After all, the compliment didn t just come from any man, it came from the man who was not supposed to defeat the media s candidate, Hillary Clinton.Many on social media have criticized the Macron couple s difference in age. Macron s campaign was very aware that the age difference could be a turn off to some voters, as the media was quick to dispel any thoughts that Brigitte was some sort of  pedophile  or  cougar.  They shared the Macron s unusual story of how Emmanuel Macron fell in love with his wife Brigitte while she was his high school drama teacher. They talked about how he pledged his love to her early on, promising he would come back some day and marry her. (How quickly everyone forgets the criticism Donald Trump got on social media for marrying the much younger Melania.)In case the world hasn t noticed, President Trump doesn t play the same game as other politicians. He s genuine and honest. He says what he feels and most importantly, he says what s in his heart. He s not a career politician, and for that, most of us are grateful. When President Trump greeted Brigitte Macron for the first time, he shook her hand, looked her straight in the eye, and complimented her on how great she looked. Trump simply told her,  You re in such great shape  and then followed it up by telling her she was  beautiful . The media and those on the left went nuts. It wasn t just individuals on social media and leftist journalists who attacked Donald Trump. One major athletic apparel and accessory company took to Twitter to mock our sitting President.For some reason, someone at Reebok thought it would be a good idea to tweet a chart to President Trump to let him know whether or not he should compliment the 64-year old Macron. When did Reebok become the arbiter of free-speech? Who, at Reebok decided it would be a good idea to mock our President on social media?  Is Reebok really such a powerful athletic wear company that they can afford to lose half of their customer base over a stupid tweet?  In case you were wondering when it IS appropriate to say, ""You're in such good shape beautiful,""  THIS: pic.twitter.com/Z1cnnRD8Ut  Reebok (@Reebok) July 14, 2017Note to Reebok: We don t care that President Trump offended French liberals and leftist American journalists. We don t care that he offended Democrat lawmakers, who are constantly looking for a reason to discredit our president. We care that President Trump loves America, and that he wakes up every day thinking about how he ll continue to bring more jobs back to Americans. We admire him for his commitment to putting America first and for his dedication to keeping our nation safe. We don t give a damn if you re offended over President Trump s  compliments to Brigitte Macron.The Macron s spent several hours with the Trump s, after President Trump offered his sincere compliments to Brigitte. Many of the photos taken after the first meeting with the Macron s and Trump s defy what the media would like you to believe about Trump s relationship with the French president and his wife. In fact, quite to the contrary, Mr. and Mrs. Macron appeared to be enjoying their visit with America s first couple quite a bit.    ",0.0

Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton said Sunday on CBS News   Face the Nation  that as many as 65,000 Syrian refugees should be taken in. We re facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II, and I think the United States has to do more,  the former secretary of State said on CBS   Face the Nation  on Sunday.  I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in.

But instead of losing part of the ceremony, students decided to lead their own prayer.Graduation at East Liverpool is filled with tradition, and this year students rejected change.

"France, Germany concerned about Trump's moves to limit refugees","PARIS (Reuters) - France, Germany and Luxembourg voiced disquiet on Saturday over U.S. President Donald Trumps decision to limit immigration and refugees from some Muslim countries, with Berlin and Paris also reaffirming a firm line on Russian sanctions. Speaking at a joint news conference in Paris with his German counterpart Sigmar Gabriel, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said many of Trumps decisions worried the two U.S. allies, including new immigration restrictions. Trump on Friday signed an executive order that will curb immigration and refugees from some Muslim-majority countries and he separately said he wanted the United States to give priority to Syrian Christians fleeing the civil war there. This can only worry us, but there are many subjects that worry us, Ayrault said, adding that he would soon invite his future American counterpart Rex Tillerson to Paris to explain Europes interests, values and vision of the world. Welcoming refugees who flee war and oppression is part of our duty, Ayrault said. Germany has taken in more than one million refugees and migrants, mainly from the Middle East, since 2015. Although traditionally open to asylum seekers, France has taken in far fewer refugees than Germany since the migrant crisis erupted. Some in the French government, mostly ex-premier Manuel Valls, criticizing Berlins open-door policy, as has Trump.  The United States is a country where Christian traditions have an important meaning. Loving your neighbor is a major Christian value, and that includes helping people, said Germanys Gabriel, who was on his first trip abroad since his nomination as foreign minister.  I think that is what unites us in the West, and I think that is what we want to make clear to the Americans. Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said Trumps order would have negative consequences. The American president is dividing the Muslim world into good and evil with this, Asselborn told the Tagesspiegel German newspaper. The decision is also bad for Europe because it will increase the Muslim worlds mistrust and hatred of the West. The two countries also reiterated their position on Russian sanctions, saying they could only be lifted if progress was made in the peace process for eastern Ukraine, where a pro-Russian separatist insurgency began in 2014. They joined British Prime Minister Theresa May in cautioning Trump against premature moves on the issue.  Lets not forget there was a war, that Russia sought to take over parts of Ukraine, Ayrault said. Trump said on Friday he was only in the early stages of considering whether to lift U.S. sanctions on Russia, but insisted he wanted to follow through on his campaign pledge to pursue better relations with Russia. The French and German ministers also said the United Nations remained the best framework to lead peace talks about Syria in the aftermath of Russian-led efforts in the Kazakh capital Astana that some diplomats say might undermine the UN process. Separately, Germany and France are also continuing to work on creating a joint tactical airlift pool of Lockheed Martin Corp C-130J military transport planes, a spokesman for the German defense ministry said on Saturday. He could not confirm a report in Der Spiegel news magazine that the two countries expected to complete work on the deal and present it to U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis at a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels next month. The magazine said German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen hoped to present the joint airlift as evidence of Germanys willingness to contribute more to NATO. Trump has criticized many European countries for not meeting a NATO target of spending 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense. ",1.0

"Trump fights for healthcare bill, makes headway with conservatives","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and House of Representatives leaders pushed on Wednesday for votes for their plan to overhaul Obamacare and said they were making progress in their efforts to win over conservative Republicans who have demanded changes to the legislation. With a vote on the bill possible as soon as Thursday, members of the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative Republican faction, said they had been negotiating alterations to the plan with the White House.  Much of the discussion hinged on conservatives desire to scrap what are labeled essential health benefits - services that insurance plans are required to cover under the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare, such as mental health help. I can tell you that were making great progress, Mark Meadows, chairman of the hardline conservative House Freedom Caucus, told reporters. Were not there yet. But were hopeful.  Trump was to meet at the White House with members of the Freedom Caucus on Thursday at 11:30 a.m, the White House said. But while the president courted conservatives, the bill appeared to be losing traction among Republican moderates, some of whom attended a meeting late Wednesday in House Speaker Paul Ryans office. Representative Charlie Dent, a leader of the Tuesday Group of House Republican moderates, issued a statement saying he could not back the bill. I believe this bill, in its current form, will lead to the loss of coverage and make insurance unaffordable for too many Americans, particularly for low- to moderate-income and older individuals, Dent said in the statement. The chairman of the House Rules Committee, which met all day Wednesday to set the rules for the bills consideration on the House floor, said late on Wednesday that the panel would resume its meeting on Thursday, having made no definite decision on the timing of the floor vote. Repealing and replacing Democratic former President Barack Obamas 2010 Affordable Care Act is a first major test of Trumps legislative ability and whether he can keep his big promises to business. Plans aired by Trump during his election campaign and his first two months in office lifted U.S. stock markets to new highs. But stocks fell back sharply on Tuesday as investors worried that a rough ride for the healthcare legislation could affect his ability to deliver on other big pieces of his agenda, from cutting taxes and regulation to boosting infrastructure. Major stock indexes wobbled on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending slightly down and the S&P 500 slightly higher. Investors are eagerly awaiting Thursdays healthcare vote, which could be pivotal for Trumps broader plans. The Freedom Caucus has objected to the bill because its members believe it is still too close to Obamacare. Representative Steve King, a conservative who was among lawmakers who met Trump on Wednesday morning at the White House,  said he would now vote for the bill because he got a commitment from Trump to publicly advocate a change to the legislation when it reaches the Senate, eliminating the essential benefits, which also include emergency room visits and maternity and newborn care. I have a full and firm commitment with many witnesses from President Trump, King said in a video statement on YouTube. Meadows said the members of the Freedom Caucus had also discussed the essential benefits with the administration. Conservatives say reducing or scrapping the mandates would bring down insurance premiums. On the other side, patient advocates say that not requiring the coverage would hurt both individuals and healthcare providers. It could leave countless people with too little coverage to meet their health care needs and drive higher rates of uncompensated care at hospitals already struggling to cover their costs, Bruce Siegel, president of Americas Essential Hospitals, said in a statement. Earlier on Wednesday, a Freedom Caucus aide said more than 25 of its members were opposed, enough to stop the bill from passing. Republicans cannot afford to lose more than 21 votes from their own party, since Democrats are united in opposition. Democrats, meanwhile, said amending the bill in the Senate would affect procedure, and increase the amount of votes Republicans would need in that chamber. Currently, Republicans intend to pass the plan through budget reconciliation, a process with little room for changes that only requires a simple majority to pass. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders also gave signs negotiations were making headway late on Wednesday. We are continuing to move forward and adding new supporters constantly, she said. As we have indicated previously we are open to changes to the bill that make it better and grow its support. The primary aim of Obamas signature legislation, passed in 2010, was reducing the numbers of Americans with no health coverage. Twenty million people gained insurance under the law. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated 14 million people would lose coverage under the Republican plan by next year. It also said 24 million fewer people would be insured by 2026.     The Republican plan would also rescind taxes created by Obamacare, repeal penalties for not buying coverage, slash funding for the Medicaid program for the poor, and modify subsidies that help individuals buy plans. In the two weeks since it was unveiled, shares of some hospital operators and health insurers have fallen more than 10 percent. If the healthcare bill passes the House, the Senate could take it up next week. Republican leaders hope that if the Senate acts quickly, the bill could go back to the House for a final vote by mid-April, possibly allowing Trump to sign it into law by Easter, April 16.   Opponents of the overhaul have been fiercely vocal, and on Wednesday protesters, many in wheelchairs or with serious medical conditions, blocked the Capitol rotunda for about an hour. Rather go to jail than die without Medicaid, they chanted. Capitol police said they made 54 arrests and later released the protesters.

"As resistance builds, Macron shifts focus away from euro reform","PARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron, concerned that a divisive discussion over euro zone reform might undermine his broader European agenda, has begun prioritizing other areas of EU cooperation, French officials say. Macron hinted at the shift at an EU summit in October when he described his plan to create a budget for the 19-nation currency bloc as a long-term project whose logic would become clear once Europe moved towards closer integration in other areas, such as defense, migration, energy and digital. Since then, French officials have told Reuters the Elysee does not want to get bogged down in a technical debate over euro zone reform at a time when the EU can deliver on other fronts that may resonate more with the public.  The euro zone is just one piece of the puzzle and I don t necessarily think it s the best one to start with,  one senior official said.  It is not our goal to have a technocratic discussion about the budget and how it would work.  During his election campaign, 39-year-old Macron talked intently about euro zone reform, seeing it as critical to strengthening the European project after years of tumult and ensuring another sovereign debt crisis didn t occur. After barely two decades of the euro, he wanted to make sure the single currency project had the strength and flexibility to last the long-run, while remaining responsive to the 350 million EU citizens who depend on it daily. French officials stress that Macron has not discarded his ideas for the euro zone. But the decision to shift them down the priority list is a recognition of the political realities in Europe. It also underscores an irony: for years German Chancellor Angela Merkel waited for an ambitious partner in France. Now she has one, but is less able to deliver herself. Germany, with which Macron had hoped to agree deep changes to euro area governance in the first half of 2018, faces months of political limbo as Merkel tries to cobble together a coalition. Early signals from Germany and other EU members have underscored how difficult it will be for Macron to deliver on his euro zone ambitions, which call for the budget, a finance minister and a separate parliament for the currency bloc. It did not go unnoticed in Paris that the new Dutch government, in its October coalition agreement, voiced opposition to any euro zone fiscal mechanism to cushion economic shocks. Earlier this month, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte spoke of his opposition to more European integration and other ideas  coming from France . A new right-wing government in Austria could adopt a similar stance to the Dutch.  Focusing on the technical details of European reform is the wrong approach,  said Sylvie Goulard, a former member of the European Parliament who served briefly as Macron s defense minister.  You really need to focus on the bigger picture - the challenge from (U.S President Donald) Trump and from China,  she said, echoing the view from people in Macron s entourage. On Friday, leaders of the 19 nations that use the euro meet in Brussels to discuss how to strengthen their currency union. The meeting is unlikely to produce anything concrete, due to political uncertainty in Berlin, and the EU goal of agreeing concrete proposals by June now looks ambitious. The prospect of another German  grand coalition  that includes the Macron-friendly Social Democrats (SPD) has alleviated some of concerns in Paris. SPD leader Martin Schulz made clear in a speech last week that he would put Europe at the top of his party s agenda in looming negotiations with Merkel, calling for a  United States of Europe  by 2025. But whether the weakened Schulz, who barely talked about Europe during the election campaign, can push Merkel towards Macron on the issue of euro zone reform is questionable.  I am very skeptical. I don t share the big hopes for the Merkel and Macron couple,  Henrik Enderlein, who heads the Berlin office of the Delors Institute, said last week at an event at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. The more cautious stance in Paris also reflects doubts about Merkel s own commitment to the changes Macron is seeking. During her coalition talks with the Free Democrats and Greens, which collapsed last month, Merkel was not an enthusiastic advocate for Macron s ideas, according to several participants from the Greens party. One central difference between Berlin and Paris has become obvious in recent months. While Macron has pushed for a multi-speed Europe in which France and Germany lead the way, there is a cross-party consensus in Berlin that any reform push should include a broad swathe of EU members. That s a position that is also backed by the European Commission. The contrast was apparent during French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire s visit to Berlin last month, where he sparred with the Greens on the inclusiveness issue, participants said. Officials in Berlin have been impressed by Macron s domestic reform push and there is a broad consensus in Merkel s party that the next German government must find ways to work with the French president. On Monday, she vowed to work with France on a joint corporate tax policy, digital initiatives and the harmonization of arms export policies. But there was no mention of his euro zone ideas.  There is still the old instinct to do as little as possible on the euro area,  said Jeromin Zettelmeyer, a former official in the German economy ministry who developed euro zone reform ideas with Macron s team when he was French economy minister.  But the old instinct to do as little as possible to accommodate France, that is gone. There is a sense that something constructive must be done.  ",1.0
WOW! THIS LETTER FROM JULY 30TH PREDICTS OBAMAS TOXIC SPILL INTO RIVER BY EPA TO SECURE SUPERFUND MONEY,"Obama s war against America on every possible front Last Wednesday, a small EPA-supervised work crew inspecting the Gold King mine accidentally knocked a hole in a waste pit, releasing at least three million gallons of acidic liquid laden with toxic heavy metals. (ABC)This letter to editor, posted below, and written by Dave Taylor, from Farmington, New Mexico, was published in The Silverton Standard and The Miner local newspaper, authored by a retired geologist, one week before EPA mine spill. The letter detailed verbatim, how EPA officials would foul up the Animas River on purpose in order to secure superfund money. If the Gold King mine was declared a superfund site it would essentially kill future development for the mining industry in the area. The Obama EPA is vehemently opposed to mining and development.The EPA pushed for nearly 25 years, to apply its Superfund program to the Gold King mine. If a leak occurred the EPA would then receive superfund status. That is exactly what happened.The EPA today admitted they misjudged the pressure in the gold mine before the spill   just as this editorial predicted.The letter was included in their print edition on July 30, 2015. The spill occurred one week later. Via: Gateway Pundit",0.0
"As U.S. ban on travel to North Korea kicks in, tourists say their farewells"," (This Aug 31 story corrects location of Burkhead s home in third paragraph.) By Christian Shepherd BEIJING (Reuters) - American tourist Nicholas Burkhead said he d be happy to return to his latest holiday destination, with its beautiful scenery, great food and friendly people. The problem is, the destination was North Korea and a U.S. State Department ban on travel to the isolated country takes effect on Friday. Burkhead, a 35-year-old resident of Virginia, was among the last American tourists to leave North Korea, landing on Thursday in Beijing.  I was surprised at how friendly everyone was,  Burkhead said after stepping off the last scheduled flight to Beijing from the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, before the U.S. travel ban kicks in.  It was very relaxing - beautiful scenery and they fed us very well in the restaurants there, but the exchange rate wasn t too good for the local won,  he told a waiting scrum of reporters. Burkhead arrived in Beijing on North Korea s state-owned Air Koryo after visiting Pyongyang as well as the city of Kaesong near the heavily armed border with South Korea. His five-day tour cost 1,850 euros ($2,200). Other Americans on the flight included two aid workers as well as Jamie Banfill, 32, who had led tours to North Korea but was visiting this time as a tourist. Banfill, who had made the trip to say goodbyes after regularly traveling to the North for a decade, said the travel ban short-sighted.  It s an extremely complex situation on the Korean peninsula and they oversimplified it,  he said. The United States last month announced a ban on U.S. passport holders from traveling to North Korea, effective Sept. 1. Journalists and humanitarian workers are allowed to apply for exemptions under the ban, which is similar to previous U.S. restrictions on travel to Iraq and Libya. Heidi Linton, director of Christian Friends of Korea, who has been working in North Korea for more than 20 years, told reporters she worried about the people her aid group helped, if her exemption was not granted soon.  We started a hepatitis B program and we have 705 patients that have been started on life-saving medicine, that if they go off that medicine then their lives are in danger,  she said.    It was not immediately clear how many Americans had sought, or been granted, exemptions or how many were still in North Korea. An official at the state department said it was not able to give an estimate on the number of U.S. citizens there. North Korea is under growing international pressure over its nuclear tests and repeated ballistic missile launches, including one this week that flew over northern Japan. The U.S. ban on travel to North Korea followed the death of U.S. college student Otto Warmbier, who was jailed during a tour last year. Warmbier, who was sentenced to 15 years hard labor for trying to steal a propaganda sign, was returned to the United States in a coma in June and died six days later. The circumstances surrounding his death are not clear, including why he fell into a coma. Warmbier had been detained leaving the airport in Pyongyang.    I was expecting a strict security check on exit but there was nothing like that,  Burkhead said. The State Department declared U.S. passports invalid for travel to, in or through North Korea. The restriction applies for one year unless extended or revoked by the secretary of state. North Korean state media has described the ban as a  sordid  attempt to limit human exchanges. North Korea is currently holding two Korean-American academics and a missionary, as well as three South Korean nationals who were doing missionary work.  This month, North Korea released a Canadian pastor who had been imprisoned there for more than two years. Hundreds of Americans are among the 4,000 to 5,000 Western tourists who visit North Korea annually, according to U.S. lawmaker Joe Wilson. ",1.0

In the more than hour-long phone call, Trump and Putin also agreed to explore ways to cooperate in the fight against militant groups such as Islamic State, the statement said. In addition, the two leaders discussed how to achieve peace in Ukraine and the need to keep pressure on North Korea to end its nuclear program, it said. ",1.0

"From bikers to truckers, pro-Trump groups plan forceful presence in Cleveland","(Reuters) - When Chris Cox rolls into Cleveland in mid-July with other motorcycle-riding supporters of Donald Trump, he plans to celebrate the billionaires coronation as the Republican presidential nominee. He also counts on joining protests if a battle over the nomination ensues. Im anticipating well be doing a victory dance, said Cox, 47, a chainsaw artist and founder of Bikers for Trump, thousands of whom he estimates will hit the Ohio city for the July 18-21 Republican National Convention.  But if the Republican Party tries to pull off any backroom deals and ignores the will of the people, our role will change. Bikers For Trump is part of a diverse array of groups coordinating to hold thousands-strong protests and marches if the real-estate mogul is denied outright victory at the Republican Partys nominating convention in Cleveland.  The risks of confrontation and violence surrounding Trump events were highlighted again on Thursday, when around 20 people were arrested following clashes between anti-Trump protesters and police outside a rally for the candidate in California. It was the worst outbreak of violence since Trump was forced to cancel a rally in Chicago in mid-March. Anti-Trump protests are expected in Cleveland. In late March, the left-leaning National Lawyers Guild held a conference in the city to coordinate legal support to protesters in the event of mass arrests during demonstrations. Leaders and members of the pro-Trump groups told Reuters their main goal is to mount a show of support for their candidate, who after a series of primary victories this week looks increasingly likely to clinch the nomination outright ahead of Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich. But if he falls short of the required 1,237 delegates, raising the risk he could lose out in a contested convention, they said they plan to do all they can to exert pressure on party leaders to prevent someone else getting the nomination. Several Trump supporters suggested that tensions could escalate if the party was seen as trying to deny Trump the nomination despite his commanding lead in delegates won in primary contests. The plan either way is send a message to the Republican establishment to respect our votes, said Ralph King, a member of the Cleveland Tea Party. If the party tries to parachute in a white knight to steal the nomination, its not going to end well.   Trump has said that if he fails to get the nomination there will be riots. Though there have been violent incidents at some Trump rallies, organizers insist they work closely with the authorities to avoid violence. The U.S. Secret Service is the lead agency for the convention. Its spokeswoman Nicole Mainor said protests or violence for such an event are factored into all of our contingency plans that have been built up over many, many months. The Cleveland Division of Police also has a security plan in place as it does for all major events of this kind, a spokeswoman said in an email, without providing further details. Bikers for Trump, which Cox founded in August and which he claims has 30,000 members and rising, is just one of a mixed bag of pro-Trump groups that aim to be in Cleveland. Reuters could not independently verify Coxs membership claims for the group, which has provided unofficial security at Trump rallies around the country. Pro-Trump groups planning a presence in Cleveland include some Tea Party-affiliated organizations, a new group called Stop The Steal led by Trump ally Roger Stone, Citizens for Trump, and the Truckers for Trump group.  King, a veteran of Tea Party rallies, is coordinating with other groups and local police to obtain permits for marches and protests during the convention, and to hold a major rally in downtown Cleveland that will then march on the convention site. Stone plans to raise $262,000 through online donations to hire buses and is negotiations with colleges in the Cleveland area on sleeping space for activists. He says he wants Republican delegates Trump has won in primaries to sign a voluntary pledge to back him beyond the first ballot should there be a contested convention.He did not disclose how much money the group has raised. Citizens for Trump co-founder Tim Selaty says he will have activists filming events inside the convention center and broadcasting them live on social mediato document every move. If Mr. Trump walks into the convention center a couple of hundred votes ahead of Cruz and loses the nomination, it will not be a pretty scene, Selaty said. Truckers for Trump says it has 4,000 members and that more than 1,000 are committed to driving their big rigs to Cleveland. The pro-Trump groups say they are not seeking confrontation but fear that opponents of their candidate might start trouble.   Our members will instructed that if theres trouble to stand back and let law enforcement do its job, said Matthew Heimbach, founder of the Traditionalist Workers Party, a pro-white nationalist, pro-working class party, which plans to have a few dozen members in Cleveland. It is unclear is how many nationalists or white supremacists might attend. Trump has adherents on the far right, including former Klu Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke, who told his radio show listeners in February that voting for anyone other than Trump was treason to your heritage. The National Socialist Movement, a prominent white nationalist group, told Reuters it did not plan any events.  Brian Culpepper, a spokesman for the Detroit-based group and a Trump supporter, said many members support the mogul. But it does not officially back Republican or Democratic office seekers as it wishes to replace the current system with a white nationalist power structure. Our members are free to attend events in Cleveland as individuals, Culpepper said. But we do not plan anything as a group. ",1.0
Hillary Clinton: Victory Fund Gets Massive Cash Injection from Hedge Fund Management (Soros),"Wall Street on ParadeAt the Democratic debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa on November 14, 2015, Hillary Clinton attempted to portray herself as the fierce enemy of hedge funds. She told the audience the following: You have two billionaire hedge fund managers who started a Super PAC and they re advertising against me in Iowa as we speak. So they clearly think I m going to do what I say I will do . But two hedge fund billionaires backing a Republican candidate pales in comparison to the tens of millions of dollars flooding into Hillary Clinton s campaign from other hedge fund billionaires   including money flowing into a joint fundraising committee called the  Hillary Victory Fund  that is sluicing money to both Hillary s main candidate committee, Hillary for America, as well as into the Democratic National Committee and 33 separate state Democratic committees, which has some observers crying foul.A recent article at CounterPunch, which questioned the ethics of the arrangement, quotes Paul Blumenthal, campaign finance reporter for the Huffington Post, as follows: It is a highly unusual arraignment if only because presidential candidates do not normally enter into fundraising agreements with their party s committees until after they actually win the nomination. And second, Clinton s fundraising committee is the first since the Supreme Court s 2014 McCutcheon v FEC decision eliminated aggregate contribution limits and congress increased party contribution limits in the 2014 omnibus budget bill. The Democratic National Committee has come under repeated fire for showing favoritism toward Hillary Clinton s candidacy versus that of Bernie Sanders. Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings show that the Hillary Victory Fund has given over $600,000 to the Democratic National Committee and tens of thousands of dollars each to the individual state committees that signed on to the joint fundraising plan.Hedge funds and private equity firms are desperate to hold on to their tax perversion known as  carried interest,  which allows their winnings to be taxed at rates lower than those paid by some plumbers and nurses. In no small part, it s how hedge fund operators ended up as billionaires, effectively subsidized by the wage earner.Federal Election Commission records show that S. Donald Sussman, founder of hedge fund Paloma Partners, gave $343,400 to the Hillary Victory Fund while also donating $2.5 million to Priorities USA, the Super Pac supporting Hillary.Hedge Fund billionaire George Soros donated $343,400 to the Hillary Victory Fund while sluicing a whopping $7 million into Priorities USA to enhance Hillary s efforts to move into the Oval Office.Jay T. Snyder of HBJ Investments, a private equity firm, gave over $300,000 to the Hillary Victory Fund.Dozens of other hedge fund and private equity operators gave lesser amounts to the Hillary Victory Fund. For example, Scott Shleifer of Tiger Global Management kicked in $167,000 while Mark Gallogly of Centerbridge Partners anted up $66,800.Other hedge fund billionaires have skipped the Hillary Victory Fund while writing out stunning amounts to the Super Pac supporting Hillary.On January 11 of this year, James Simons, the billionaire founder of hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, who now runs a family office called Euclidean Capital, wrote out a single check for $3.5 million to Priorities USA.According to the latest filing at the FEC, the Hillary Victory Fund joint fundraising committee has raised $26.9 million.According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Priorities USA has raised $55.6 million while Hillary s own campaign committee, Hillary for America, has raised $159.9 million.READ MORE US ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Election Files",0.0
CHICAGO THUGS Watched 9 Yr Old Play On Swings Before Carrying Out His Brutal Murder In Retaliation Against Dads Gang,"UPDATE: No #BlackLivesMatter Protests PlannedChicago has no shortage of thugs. What they do have a shortage of is support from the #BlackLivesMatter terrorists and Obama Regime. You don t hear our Community Organizer In Chief running to a microphone every time a young black man or woman is murdered at the hands of another black man or woman. Sadly, it doesn t fit their narrative. This young boy s murder is far more tragic than the plight of the Muslim boy, with a history of discipline issues, who took a fake bomb to school in Texas on 9-11 and was rightly punished for his behavior by school officials. The phony outrage that Obama showed the world over this little fake  clock boy s  arrest should sicken every American. It is especially disturbing when one considers Obama s deafening silence over the horrific gang violence that plagues his hometown of Chicago. Where were the tweets of outrage from the White House over the loss of this beautiful young boy s life? Crickets On Friday, prosecutors laid out their case against a man accused of murdering 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee on Nov. 2Corey Morgan, 27, of suburban Lansing, was charged in the murder. Police have one other man in custody who has not yet been charged, and a third man, Kevin Edwards, is also wanted in the slaying.Prosecutors say Corey Morgan (left) and Kevin Edwards planned the heinous murder of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee.Assistant State s Attorney George Canellis said Friday the shooting stemmed from an ongoing feud between Morgan s gang, the BBG (Bang Bang Gang)/Terror Dome faction of the Black P Stones and the Killaward faction of the Gangster Disciples.The feud came to a boil after an Oct. 13 shooting in which Morgan s brother, Tracey Morgan was killed and his mother was wounded. Morgan was so enraged he threatened to shoot  grandmas, mamas, kids and all  in retaliation, prosecutors said.Tyshawn was hit in his back, forearm and head, and part of his thumb was shot off as if he was raising his hand to block the shots, Canellis said. This murder was committed in a cold, calculated and premeditated manner,  Canellis said.Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy vowed to destroy the group responsible for the boy s brutal murder. They are going to be obliterated,  he said.  That gang just signed its death warrant. McCarthy did not detail each suspect s role in the shooting. We know that there were three individuals involved in this,  he said.Morgan s arrest comes nearly a month after Tyshawn s Nov. 2 shooting death.Police are hunting for Kevin Edwards, also suspected in the shooting.Court documents paint a disturbing picture of the planned attack, explaining that Morgan and his accomplices allegedly saw Tyshawn playing on the swings in a playlot with his basketball beside him. One of the suspects allegedly started dribbling Tyshawn s ball, ultimately luring him into the alley where police say he was  executed.

 Trump: We Should Default On Our Debt Because We Can Just Print The Money,"A lot of time people ask the question: why can t we just print more money to get rid of our debt? The answer is simple. If you just print more money, you will be completely devalue our currency, thus sending our nation into a destructive economic tailspin, much like Germany in the early part of the 21st century.And if you re Donald Trump, you re A-OK with doing just that.The self described business  genius  just showed the American people how truly stupid and inept he is today when he gave a reason as to why America should default on its debt: just print more money, and buy it back. Appearing on CNN s New Day, Trump told host Chris Cuomo: People said I want to go and buy debt and default on debt, and I mean, these people are crazy. This is the United States government. First of all, you never have to default because you print the money, I hate to tell you, OK? Trump s plan basically consists of this: we don t raise the debt-ceiling, thus defaulting. But we won t default because interest rates will go up and we will use our liquid assets such as cash (which we ll print more of) to buy back bonds at a discount that will cover the debt.According to the Washington Post:The items in the federal budget that are the overwhelming drivers of long-term deficits wouldn t really be helped if the government were to unleash massive inflation. The federal government has pledged to pay for medical care for the elderly (through Medicare) for the poor (Medicaid) and provide basic retirement income (Social Security).But for each of those programs, inflation wouldn t solve the government s financial problems. It would make them worse (to put it in the technical language, they are real obligations, not nominal obligations).So, in other words, medical costs would skyrocket and social security payments would have to freeze, etc. The country would be in chaos.This comes after Trump touted himself as the  debt king  who  loves debt  and would use his  experience  in debt to solve all our problems and make us great again and that means printing more money to give us a faux impression of economic security, the same impression that brought many nations to their knees.This is the man who is supposed to be the economic genius and the one who will make America an economic powerhouse?The level of stupidity is maddening.Featured image via Mark Lyons/Getty Images",0.0
RECKLESS: CLINTON PRESIDENCY Could Mean U.S. Muslim Population Would Exceed Germanys 4.8 Million [VIDEO],"Hillary Clinton always putting a radical ideology and her own personal financial gain before the best interests of America. Is this really the kind of leader America needs after 8 miserable, lawless years of Barack Obama? Under two terms of a President Hillary Clinton, the U.S. Muslim population would exceed Germany s current Muslim population, according to data from Pew Research Center and the Department of Homeland Security.According to a Pew report published earlier this week,  as of 2010, there were 4.8 million Muslims in Germany. In September, 2015, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton that the United States should accept 65,000 refugees from Syria to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis created by the war there. We re facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II and I think the United States has to do more,  the former secretary of state said Sunday on CBS   Face the Nation.   I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in.  Via: CBS NewsHere s Trump on the out-of-control refugee crisis and common sense ideas on how he thinks America should deal with it:A Pew report from January of this year estimated that there are roughly 3.3 million Muslims living in the United States. This means that today the U.S. already has a larger Muslim population than does Kuwait, or Brunei, or Bahrain, or Djibouti, or Qatar. Under current policy, Pew projects the number of Muslims in America will outnumber Jews by 2040. However, under a President Hillary Clinton it s possible that date could come much sooner.Under two terms of a Hillary Clinton presidency, the U.S. would have a Muslim population that is larger than Germany s Muslim population of 4.8 million.Based on the most recent DHS data available, the U.S. permanently resettled roughly 149,000 migrants from predominantly Muslim countries on green cards in 2014.Yet, as Donald Trump explained during Thursday night acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, Clinton  has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama. Specifically, Clinton had said that, as president, she would expand Muslim migration by importing an additional 65,000 Syrian refugees into the United States during the course of a single fiscal year. Clinton has made no indication that she would limit her proposed Syrian refugee program to one year.As Trump explained, Clinton s Syrian refugees would come on top of the tens of thousands of refugees the U.S. already admits from Muslim countries.Adding Clinton s 65,000 Syrian refugees to the approximately 149,000 Muslim migrants the U.S. resettled on green cards in the course of one year, means that Clinton could permanently resettle roughly 214,000 Muslim migrants in her first year as President. If Clinton were to continue her Syrian refugee program throughout her Presidency, she could potentially resettle roughly 1.5 million Muslim migrants during her first two terms.These projections suggest that after seven years of a Hillary Clinton Presidency, the U.S. could have a Muslim population that is larger than Germany s Muslim population of 4.8 million.These projections are rough estimates, and the population size could be impacted by additional various factors  including births, deaths, and conversions.

"We'll buy arms from Russia, Philippines' Duterte tells Putin","DANANG, Vietnam (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte thanked Moscow on Friday for its  timely assistance  in defeating pro-Islamic State militants who took over a southern city for months, expressing his willingness to buy Russian weapons. Duterte last month declared the liberation of Marawi City from Islamist militants after 154 days of fighting, which killed more than 1,100 people, including 165 soldiers, and displaced nearly 400,000 residents.   I want to build a strong armed forces and a strong police and the reason is very important for you to know that we are eyeing - we are buying arms from Russia this time,  Duterte told Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam. The Philippines was to buy more than 20,000 assault rifles from the United States, but some senators, concerned with Duterte s human rights record and rising killings, blocked that sale. But China and Russia, whose relations with the Philippines have vastly improved in recent months, donated a total of 11,000 assault rifles and trucks.  Your timely assistance to my country helped us replenish the old arms and the spent bores that were fired repeatedly and we have a new stock,  he said, in transcripts sent to Manila by the presidential communications office. Manila and Moscow signed a military deal on logistics, including a contract with a state-owned company for the supply of equipment, during the first-ever visit by a Russian defense minister to the Philippines last month.  The Philippines will have a 125 billion pesos ($2.44 billion) fund to modernize the military from 2018 to 2022 through a multi-year congressional allocation to upgrade its hardware, a senior military official told Reuters.  We are looking at helicopters, small arms and equipment for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations, but we are still discussing the specifics,  said the same military official who declined to be named because he was not authorized to talk to the press.  We still prefer U.S. and Western equipment but they are very expensive. If the Russians and Chinese equipment can be comparable in quality, then they can be excellent alternatives.    ",1.0
 Bush Speechwriter BRUTALLY Attacks Media For Pro-Trump Lies,"You know lies have gotten out of control when a man who helped orchestrate the Iraq wars, a man who coined the term  axis of evil  and who helped push the lie of weapons of mass destruction, calls Trump propaganda what it is. Former George W. Bush speech writer David Frum has been one of the ironic voices of reason when it comes to the President Elect and the media that s fawning all over him.Frum took to Twitter on Sunday with a series of tweets that s guaranteed to piss Trump off. Frum warned that  Trump s lying about the popular vote has dangerous real-world consequences.  He called Trump a  narcissist  who will surround himself with sycophants (my word) and convince true believers  to act en masse as if the lies were truth. According to Frum, another consequence of Trump s lies will be to encourage Congress to be reckless.Even more surprisingly, Frum, an old school Republican, admitted that Republicans have lost the popular vote in every single election but one over the last 28 years. That, to Frum, means that Republicans should rule with caution, since they don t have a mandate.Trump s lying about the popular vote has dangerous real-world consequences  David Frum (@davidfrum) December 18, 20161) Trump, a textbook case of Narcissistic Personality Disorder, will believe the lies he tells, after he tells them https://t.co/ZCXPUGNxtc  David Frum (@davidfrum) December 18, 20162) Meaning that Trump will live among ego-salving fantasies   a dangerous location for a president of the United States  David Frum (@davidfrum) December 18, 20163) Worse, Trump will surround himself by people who repeat his lies back to him: either a) abject creatives or b) sinister manipulators  David Frum (@davidfrum) December 18, 20164) Worse still: because the conservative media amplify Trump s lies, the whole conservative world will lose touch with reality  David Frum (@davidfrum) December 18, 20165) Encouraging true believers   and compelling even pragmatists   to act en masse as if the lies were truth.

Not well, I fear.-30-  David Frum (@davidfrum) December 18, 2016Frum is right and he knows a thing or two about propaganda. Trump has taken his fake news cues directly from the Kremlin and his supporters are believing the lies. Polls show that the majority of Americans don t believe the news media. More than half of Republicans think Trump won the popular vote. He didn t. He lost by almost 3 million votes.We are entering a very dangerous time. While people lose confidence in all our institutions, a demagogue who s plagued with strong foreign influences and too many conflicts of interest to count has taken over the presidency, all without the permission of vast majority of the American people. That s all we really need to know about the incoming Trump administration.Featured image of David Frum via Frazer Harrison/Getty Images | Featured image of Donald Trump via Tom Pennington/Getty Images.

"North Korea moving airplanes, boosting defense after U.S. bomber flight: Yonhap","SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has been moving airplanes and boosting defenses on its east coast after the United States dispatched B-1B bombers to the Korean peninsula over the weekend, South Korea s Yonhap News Agency reported on Tuesday, citing the country s spy agency.  The United States seemed to have disclosed the flight route of the bombers intentionally because North Korea seemed to be unaware, the report said. South Korea s National Intelligence Service was unable to confirm the report immediately. North Korea s foreign minister said on Monday that U.S. President Donald Trump had declared war on North Korea and that Pyongyang reserved the right to take countermeasures, including shooting down U.S. bombers even if they are not in its air space.

 ALL Of The GOP Candidates Would WRECK Our Environment  Heres How,"During the most recent Republican Presidential debate, Donald Trump proposed getting rid of the Environmental Protection Agency altogether, a government agency founded in 1970 by Republican President Richard Nixon. Trump s skewed logic was the agency s $8 billion budget is wasted and should be reallocated to the states.In response to Rubio s pressing of Trump for what his plan is to cut taxes and balance the federal budget, Trump replied: Environmental protection   we waste all of this money. We re going to bring that back to the states. We are going to cut many of the agencies, we will balance our budget and we will be dynamic again. The radical proposal of Trump defies anything remotely close to being realistic. Trump has also accused the EPA of creating more damage than they protect and making it impossible for the country to compete. His rhetoric is part of the mode of thinking many of his supporters have, that the government somehow is impeding their ability to improve their lives, and the solution is de-regulating everything in order for a free market of competition will solve everything. In reality, dissolving the EPA, which would involve repealing many environmental laws, would leave environmental protection up to the states, where most do not have the resources to enforce meaningful environmental regulations. This would also cause a vacuum of competition where states would try to appeal to hazardous industries to come to their state by downgrading environmental regulations.Because the entire Republican Party has lost their minds, Trump s proposal is one that has also been adopted by Senator Marco Rubio and Senator Ted Cruz. This past January, Rubio dubbed the EPA, the  Employment Prevention Agency,  adding the agency s regulations are out of control and hurt our economy.Cruz, who already is notorious for wanting to repeal all federal climate change regulation and the Clean Air Act, told Breitbart News in 2015,  I think states should press back using every tool they have available. We ve got to rein in a lawless executive that is abusing its power,  in response to a question as to whether states should comply with EPA coal regulations.The proposal to get rid of the EPA would be disastrous for the environment and the daily lives of every American. The endemic species throughout this country and the ecosystems they inhabit are already under insurmountable stress, and the science overwhelmingly shows environmental regulations, caps, and oversight are needed to mitigate the effects of climate change and other environmental influences.Dissolving the EPA is just one of the many dangers the Republican presidential candidates pose to the American public if elected, and if they were ever successful in doing so, the damage incurred could potentially destroy parts of the country indefinitely with hazardous sites, toxic waste pollution, and increasing emission rates becoming more of the norm. If anything, the EPA s funding needs to be increased, and the agency improved by making it more effective, because the stakes couldn t be higher. America cannot afford a president who doesn t understand action needs to be made to combat climate change, not worsen it.Featured image via Screen Capture",0.0
Trump embraces Democrats again on debt ceiling and immigration,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday embraced a suggestion from the Senates top Democrat to end congressional battles over the U.S. debt ceiling, a day after he stunned fellow Republicans by striking a major budget deal with the opposition party. Testing his new opening with Democrats, Trump also reached out on another tricky issue, the fate of 800,000 so-called Dreamers, young adults brought illegally to the country as children. He even honored a request by Nancy Pelosi, the top House of Representatives Democrat, to publicly reassure the Dreamers they do not face imminent deportation. The Senate voted 80-17 to approve the deal Trump reached with Democrats on Wednesday, which would raise the federal debt limit and fund the government through Dec. 8. The legislation included $15.25 billion in aid for areas affected by Hurricane Harvey and other natural disasters. The bill now goes to the House for final congressional approval, where it faces opposition from conservatives who traditionally favor raising the ceiling while also cutting spending. Representative Bill Flores, a Republican helping round up votes for the deal, said his count of party members intending to vote yes on the legislation didnt look very good. Trump voiced support on Thursday for the idea of eliminating the statutory cap on the U.S. Treasury Departments authority to borrow. For many years, people have been talking about getting rid of debt ceiling altogether, and there are a lot of good reasons to do that, Trump told reporters. It complicates things, its really not necessary. So certainly thats something that will be discussed, he added. Legislation that would end the need for Congress to regularly authorize debt ceiling increases came up during a White House meeting Trump had on Wednesday with Pelosi, top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, people familiar with the meeting said. Schumer proposed eliminating the limit, and Trump and Vice President Mike Pence said they liked the idea, one source said. Schumer said the parties should canvass rank-and-file lawmakers to gauge support for getting rid of the ceiling ahead of the next deadline to raise it, in December, the source said. The meetings participants did not say whether they would seek to repeal the cap or revert to a practice of automatic increases tied to Congress approving its annual budget, the sources said. Republican Ryan said he opposed any effort to do away with lawmakers role in approving debt limit increases, citing the powers given to Congress under the U.S. Constitution. The United States spends more than it raises through taxes and other revenue, and issues debt to make up the difference. The limit on how much it can borrow is the debt ceiling. Congress must regularly vote to raise the cap, which frequently sparks nasty political fights that spook financial markets over the prospect of an unprecedented U.S. default. Representative Barry Loudermilk, a member of the conservative Republican Study Committee, said the proposal to scrap the debt ceiling was worth exploring. This is something that just comes up over and over again and weve never done anything to fix it, he said, adding lawmakers should have a conversation about finding a permanent fix that also leads to cutting deficit spending, such as a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.  But Republican Representative Joe Barton, who belongs to the partys right-wing Freedom Caucus, said scrapping the debt ceiling was wrong and he hoped Trump reconsiders his position. Schumer said on Thursday he hoped the meeting was a ray of hope for both parties coming together on the big issues. Pelosi said Trump also made clear he wanted Congress to act on the Dreamers issue. U.S. lawmakers for years have failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation. On Tuesday, Trump rescinded a program created by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that protected the immigrants from deportation and provided them work permits. Trump gave Congress six months to work on an alternative by delaying implementation until March.  Democrats want a bill addressing the Dreamers without other issues attached, but Pelosi did not rule out including border security measures that Trump and Ryan want. Pelosi said we have a responsibility to secure our borders, but that does not include Trumps planned wall along the U.S.-Mexico border that many Democrats oppose. We want to do it as soon as possible to strike while the iron is hot, because public opinion is so much in favor, Pelosi told reporters. Pelosi said she told Trump the Dreamers needed his assurance he was not planning a six-month-long roundup for deportation. Trump subsequently wrote on Twitter: For all of those (DACA) that are concerned about your status during the 6 month period, you have nothing to worry about - No action!  ",1.0
IRAQ 1991: US Carpet Bombs Highway of Death,"ROAR MagI want to give testimony on what are called the  highways of death. These are the two Kuwaiti roadways, littered with remains of 2,000 mangled Iraqi military vehicles, and the charred and dismembered bodies of tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers, who were withdrawing from Kuwait on February 26th and 27th 1991 in compliance with UN resolutions.US planes trapped the long convoys by disabling vehicles in the front, and at the rear, and then pounded the resulting traffic jams for hours.  It was like shooting fish in a barrel,  said one US pilot. The horror is still there to see.On the inland highway to Basra is mile after mile of burned, smashed, shattered vehicles of every description   tanks, armored cars, trucks, autos, fire trucks, according to the March 18, 1991, Time magazine. On the sixty miles of coastal highway, Iraqi military units sit in gruesome repose, scorched skeletons of vehicles and men alike, black and awful under the sun, says the Los Angeles Times of March 11, 1991. While 450 people survived the inland road bombing to surrender, this was not the case with the 60 miles of the coastal road. There for 60 miles every vehicle was strafed or bombed, every windshield is shattered, every tank is burned, every truck is riddled with shell fragments. No survivors are known or likely. The cabs of trucks were bombed so much that they were pushed into the ground, and it s impossible to see if they contain drivers or not. Windshields were melted away, and huge tanks were reduced to shrapnel. Even in Vietnam I didn t see anything like this. It s pathetic,  said Major Bob Nugent, an Army intelligence officer. This one-sided carnage, this racist mass murder of Arab people, occurred while White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater promised that the US and its coalition partners would not attack Iraqi forces leaving Kuwait. This is surely one of the most heinous war crimes in contemporary history. The Iraqi troops were not being driven out of Kuwait by US troops as the Bush administration maintains. They were not retreating in order to regroup and fight again. In fact, they were withdrawing, they were going home, responding to orders issued by Baghdad, announcing that it was complying with Resolution 660 and leaving Kuwait. At 5:35 p.m. (Eastern standard Time) Baghdad radio announced that Iraq s Foreign Minister had accepted the Soviet cease-fire proposal and had issued the order for all Iraqi troops to withdraw to postions held before August 2, 1990 in compliance with UN Resolution 660. President Bush responded immediately from the White House saying (through spokesman Marlin Fitzwater) that  there was no evidence to suggest the Iraqi army is withdrawing. In fact, Iraqi units are continuing to fight. . . We continue to prosecute the war.  On the next day, February 26, 1991, Saddam Hussein announced on Baghdad radio that Iraqi troops had, indeed, begun to withdraw from Kuwait and that the withdrawal would be complete that day. Again, Bush reacted, calling Hussein s announcement  an outrage  and  a cruel hoax. Eyewitness Kuwaitis attest that the withdrawal began the afternoon of February 26, 1991 and Baghdad radio announced at 2:00 AM (local time) that morning that the government had ordered all troops to withdraw. The massacre of withdrawing Iraqi soldiers violates the Geneva Conventions of 1949, Common Article III, which outlaws the killing of soldiers who are out of combat. The point of contention involves the Bush administration s claim that the Iraqi troops were retreating to regroup and fight again. Such a claim is the only way that the massacre which occurred could be considered legal under international law. But in fact the claim is false and obviously so. The troops were withdrawing and removing themselves from combat under direct orders from Baghdad that the war was over and that Iraq had quit and would fully comply with UN resolutions. To attack the soldiers returning home under these circumstances is a war crime.Iraq accepted UN Resolution 660 and offered to withdraw from Kuwait through Soviet mediation on February 21, 1991. A statement made by George Bush on February 27, 1991, that no quarter would be given to remaining Iraqi soldiers violates even the US Field Manual of 1956. The 1907 Hague Convention governing land warfare also makes it illegal to declare that no quarter will be given to withdrawing soldiers. On February 26,199 I, the following dispatch was filed from the deck of the USS. Ranger, under the byline of Randall Richard of the Providence Journal: Air strikes against Iraqi troops retreating from Kuwait were being launched so feverishly from this carrier today that pilots said they took whatever bombs happened to be closest to the flight deck. The crews, working to the strains of the Lone Ranger theme, often passed up the projectile of choice . . . because it took too long to load. New York Times reporter Maureen Dowd wrote,  With the Iraqi leader facing military defeat, Mr. Bush decided that he would rather gamble on a violent and potentially unpopular ground war than risk the alternative: an imperfect settlement hammered out by the Soviets and Iraqis that world opinion might accept as tolerable. In short, rather than accept the offer of Iraq to surrender and leave the field of battle, Bush and the US military strategists decided simply to kill as many Iraqis as they possibly could while the chance lasted Continue this story at ROAR MagazineREAD MORE IRAQ NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Iraq Files",0.0

 Donald Trump Congratulates Himself On Winning Election And Asks For Donations While Puerto Ricans BEG For Help,"During a time of national crisis, most presidents focus on helping people in need. But not Donald Trump. Instead, he is sending out mass text messages to stroke his own ego and try to raise money. He keeps telling his fans that if they don t keep donating, their big election upset will all be for naught. Here are the texts he sent to his most ardent fans (and a few people who just subscribe for the lulz):Now, to put this into context, the people of Puerto Rico are literally dying. Trump has, instead of trying to help them, attacked the mayor of San Juan on Twitter for begging for help to save the lives of the Americans who live there, and his disaster response has been abysmal, because, you know, brown people. And now, he sends out lying mass communications pretending that he has helped people and delivered on promises when he has done no such thing. Hell, there is plenty of evidence that there was even a point in time when Trump didn t even realize that the people of Puerto Rico are American citizens.In short, this is a man who is raising money off the backs of suffering and dying people, and using the protests of NFL players who want to use their platforms to shine a light on the injustices suffered at the hands of law enforcement by people of color to stoke racial divisions in the nation. In fact, there is even evidence that this part of it was planned. MSNBC s Rachel Maddow explains that bit perfectly:Donald Trump s racist, divisive actions are absolutely disgraceful, and people are literally dying on his watch. This man is not a president. He s a racist and a murderer.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",0.0
" On The Anniversary Of The Berlin Wall Coming Down, Trump Is On His Way Towards Building His Own","Americans woke up on to a country that will soon have Donald Trump serving as president. It is a frightening realization. However, overcome with horror, the irony of the date went largely unnoticed by many. November 9, the day after Election Day, is the anniversary of the Berlin Wall coming down.On this day in 1989, the spokesman for East Berlin s Communist Party announced that citizens of the GDR would be permitted to freely cross the country s borders. The scene of East and West Berliners flooding to the site became iconic. People used hammers and picks to chip away at the wall. The reunification of East and West Germany was made official on October 3, 1990, almost one year after the fall of the Berlin Wall. While almost three decades ago this date became synonymous with freedom in the hearts and minds of so many, Americans woke up today to a president-elect that plans to build a wall of his own. Since the very beginning of his election, Trump has promised to build a wall along the border between Mexico and the United States. Of course, he still insists that Mexico is going to pay for it. Anti-immigrant rhetoric served as the foundation of Trump s campaign and the wall was his keystone.Anti-immigrant rhetoric has served as the foundation of Trump s campaign and the wall has been his keystone. While most of us were simply overwhelmed by the reality of a Trump presidency, some couldn t help but notice the date and point out the irony.The sad irony is that the #berlinwall came down today in 1989 and #PresidentTrump is about to build a new one that will be just as brutal.

 George H.W. Bush May Have Just Dealt An Incredibly Stinging Blow To The Trump Train,"Guess who George H.W. Bush is voting for? He lost to Bill Clinton in 1992, and his son is George W. Bush. Yet it seems that the elder Bush finds Trump so distasteful a candidate that he s actually going to cast his vote for Hillary Clinton.According to Politico, Bush Sr. had originally planned on keeping quiet about this election. Considering the fact that he s a Republican, and therefore expected to weigh in on the side of the Republicans  chosen candidate, this is actually pretty major. But it wasn t Bush himself who revealed his vote. It was Kathleen Kennedy Townsend daughter of the late Robert Kennedy who let this particular interesting tidbit slip: On Monday, Townsend posted a picture on her Facebook page shaking hands next to the former president and this caption:  The President told me he s voting for Hillary!!' She stood by that later on when talking to Politico. According to her, George H.W. Bush would rather vote for his former rival and successor s wife than the god-awful train wreck that is Donald Trump.A spokesman for the Bush family refused to actually confirm this   he said that George H.W. s vote is a private decision and will remain so. He himself isn t commenting, but it seems that those who are in his inner circle aren t being so tight-lipped, if Kennedy is to be believed.Bush Sr. did make it clear back in May that he had absolutely zero intention of endorsing Trump. That s a bold, but wise, move for any Republican, since Republicans are supposed to be on the side of freedom and Trump is on the side of dictatorship and authoritarianism.His love of Russian president Vladimir Putin would suggest that he s also on the side of autocracy. None of these three things meshes with the democracy Republicans say we ve built in even the smallest way.Earlier in the summer, an administration official for George W. Bush announced that she would vote for Hillary, adding her name to an ever-growing list of Republicans and conservatives who can t find it within themselves to support Trump. Jeb Bush has said he can neither vote for Hillary nor Trump.A former Republican president refusing to stand for the current Republican nominee is a stinging blow indeed.Featured image by Scott Halleran/Getty Images",0.0
WATCH: MITT ROMNEY DOESNT Think Roy Moore Deserves Fair Treatment In Questionable 40-Year-Old Sex Assault AllegationsHas Romney Already Forgotten What Harry Reids LIE Did To His Campaign?,"Yesterday, former GOP Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, came out with one of his most incredible statements to date. After months of silence, Mitt tweeted about the 36-40-year-old sexual misconduct allegations against Alabama s Republican candidate for Senator, Judge Roy Moore.In his tweet, Mitt told Americans that Judge Roy Moore was not entitled to a fair investigation and that Moore should  step aside . Romney tweeted:  Innocent until proven guilty is for criminal convictions, not elections. I believe Leigh Corfman. Her account is too serious to ignore. Moore is unfit for office and should step aside. Innocent until proven guilty is for criminal convictions, not elections. I believe Leigh Corfman. Her account is too serious to ignore. Moore is unfit for office and should step aside.  Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) November 10, 2017Mitt has remained mostly dormant since he went off on his anti-Trump rant just before the Presidential election.  The last time we saw Mitt, was when he was in Trump Towers, pandering to President-elect Trump for a job in his administration. It appears that, much like John McCain, the anti-conservative, bitter, former GOP presidential candidate just can t keep his disdain for Republicans, who are unafraid to openly fight for their convictions, to himself. Perhaps Mitt s nasty remarks were intended to help ingratiate himself with liberal voters in Utah, as he allegedly is preparing to run for the retiring Republican Senator Orin Hatch s seat. It s also quite possible that after the United States watched Mitt give up the race after he pummeled Barack Obama in their first presidential debate, that Mitt just doesn t  have the stomach for Republicans who actually fight back when they re being attacked by the left.Is it possible that Mitt has already forgotten the lie that Harry Reid pushed out to the voters only months before the election about Mitt not paying taxes for the past 1w years?On July 12, 2012, Senator Harry Reid stood before his comrades on the Senate floor and told a bald-faced lie about then-candidate Mitt Romney not paying his taxes for the past 12 years. Reid knowingly lied to Congress telling them Mitt Romney s father set the precedent for presidential candidates allowing the American public to view their taxes, but Mitt Romney can t do that because he s paid no taxes for 12 years. His father, George Romney, set the precedent that people running for president would file their tax returns, let everybody look at them. But Mitt Romney can t do that because he s basically paid no taxes in the prior 12 years. Watch:Two years later, Harry Reid was later questioned by CNN s Dana Bash about the lie he told to his fellow Senators. His response could not have been more arrogant or disrespectful to the American voters who based their votes for Barack Obama, based on a lie that Senator Harry Reid told only 4 months before the election.So, tell us again Mitt, how it doesn t matter if a political candidate is guilty of charges levied against him by the left, that their only response must be to  step down  if they re accused of wrongdoing.Yesterday, it was revealed that at least one of Judge Roy Moore s accusers was deeply involved in Democrat politics, is virulently anti-Trump, and has been openly pushing for Judge Roy Moore s Democrat opponent Doug Ross on her personal Facebook page.It was also revealed that Stephanie McCrummen, one of the co-writers of the Washington Post article that smeared Moore with 4 unproven allegations has a history of  faking  things to benefit herself (read more HERE). More and more details continue to emerge about Roy Moore s alleged  victims .Stay tuned, for those of us who are sick and tired of watching Republicans get kicked around and watching their careers being ruined, this isn t over yet ",0.0
Light aircraft crash kills 11 in Tanzania,"DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - At least 11 people were killed in northern Tanzania on Wednesday when a light aircraft flying to the Serengeti National Park, a popular tourist destination, crashed, the flight operator said. The Cessna Caravan light airplane, carrying a pilot and 10 passengers, was flying tourists from the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha when it went down in the Ngorongoro crater at about 0800 GMT, Coastal Aviation said in a statement. The Tanzanian air charter company said the identities of the dead would be withheld until their families are notified.  This is devastating,  the company said. The cause of the accident was unknown, police said. The nationalities of the tourists on board the aircraft could not be immediately established. Tanzania, a leading tourist destination in East Africa, is best known for its pristine beaches, wildlife safaris and Mount Kilimanjaro.

"Liz Cheney's Wyoming campaign backed by big names, bigger money","CODY, Wyo. (Reuters) - Former Vice President Dick Cheneys eldest daughter, bouncing back from an aborted 2014 U.S. Senate bid, heads into a crowded primary race next week for Wyomings lone seat in the House of Representatives buoyed by big-name Republicans and wealthy out-of-state donors. Liz Cheney, the apparent Republican front-runner, has commanded a level of fund-raising and A-list party support - including two former presidents and onetime Cabinet members - that is rare, if not unheard of, for a relative newcomer to Wyoming politics. Her strength is even more significant in a solidly red state where the Republican primary winner is virtually assured victory in the general election. She can go to Chicago or New York, and in one fund-raiser pull in more money than the next two closest candidates combined, said Deb Oakley Simpson, a daughter-in-law of former longtime Wyoming Republican Senator Alan Simpson and a Cody-based civic activist who backs one of Cheneys primary foes, state Senator Leland Christensen. To date, Cheney, 49, has received individual donations totaling more than $1.1 million, far outpacing the collective campaign receipts of her seven Republican opponents and the two Democrats running in Wyomings primary elections on Tuesday. According to the latest opinion poll on the race, conducted during the second week of July, more than half of Wyoming voters were undecided, but Cheney led with 21 percent, more than twice the following of her nearest competitor. Her standing marks a striking turnaround from her first bid for public office, when she returned to her home state three years ago to challenge incumbent Senator Mike Enzi and was branded by some fellow Republicans as a carpetbagger backed by deep-pocketed outsiders. Her campaign also suffered from a public feud with her sister Mary Cheney, a lesbian, over Liz Cheneys opposition to same-sex marriage.  She ended up withdrawing from that race several months later, citing a family health crisis. Cheney and her husband, Phil Perry, an attorney, have five children. Now Cheney, also a lawyer who worked in the State Department while her father was vice president, is leveraging her Washington connections as she runs for the open, at-large House seat in the nations least populous state. Campaigning as a strong conservative voice for Wyoming, she has vowed to protect the states pivotal coal industry, defend gun rights and generally work to reverse President Obamas devastating policies. Among her contributors are a prominent group of her fathers former high-ranking government colleagues, including former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, as well as former Secretary of State James Baker, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and former White House political adviser Karl Rove. Other prominent donors include New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, Colorado oil and entertainment magnate Philip Anschutz, brewing executive Pete Coors, Texas financier T. Boone Pickens, and Chicago real estate and media investor Sam Zell. Cheneys two closest Republican primary rivals are state Representative Tim Stubson and Christensen, who rank second and third, respectively, in fund-raising and in polls.  They have raised $255,000 combined in individual donations. Cheney, who was on the campaign trail and unavailable for comment, has accepted no political action committee funds, and PAC funding has figured little in the race. She raised the bulk of her campaign money by the end of March, with nearly half of individual contributions meeting the $2,700 limit set by federal election laws. Most came from outside Wyoming. Still, Cheney has raised more money from more Wyoming donors than any of her opponents, and contributions from all 50 states, campaign manager Bill Novotny said.  A national effort is what its going to take to stand up to Hillary Clinton at the top of the Democratic ticket in November, he added. ",1.0
Factbox: Highlights of draft U.N. North Korea sanctions resolution,"(Reuters) - The United States on Thursday proposed a draft United Nations Security Council resolution that would dramatically tighten sanctions on North Korea following Pyongyangs recent nuclear test and missile launch. Here is an overview of the draft resolution circulated to the 15-member council:    The draft resolution targets North Koreas conventional arms capabilities by closing a gap in the arms embargo that had allowed small arms and light weapons to be sent to North Korea. North Korea would instead be subjected to a full arms embargo on all weapons. It has an unprecedented ban on the transfer to North Korea of any item that could directly contribute to the operational capabilities of the North Korean armed forces, such as trucks that could be modified for military purposes. It bans states from hosting North Korean military and policy trainers and advisors.  The draft resolution has a new requirement that states expel North Korean diplomats who are involved in illicit activities. The draft resolution has a new requirement that states must inspect on their territory all cargo going to or coming from North Korea via land, sea or air. Previously states were only required to do this if they had reasonable grounds to believe there was illicit cargo. It calls upon states to carry out inspections in a way that minimizes impact on the transfer of humanitarian relief cargo. It would ban all flights suspected of carrying prohibited items and ban all port calls by any vessel suspected of engaging in illicit activities. All vessels belonging to Ocean Maritime Management Company Limited would be banned from entering any port.  It would require states to ban the chartering of their vessels or aircraft by North Korea, unless the state determines those services are for livelihood purposes and will not be used by North Korea to generate revenue. It also requires states to ban their nationals from operating North Korean vessels or using North Korean flags of convenience.  The draft resolution would ban the supply or transfer to North Korea of aviation fuel, including rocket fuel.  It would ban the export of gold, titanium ore, vanadium ore and rare earth minerals. It would also ban the export of coal, iron and iron ore unless such transactions are for livelihood purposes and would not be generating revenue for North Koreas nuclear and missile programs.  The draft resolution would require states to freeze the assets of any entity of the North Korean government or the ruling Workers Party of Korea that is associated with the nuclear and missile programs or other prohibited activities.

"Rebel Honduran police ignore curfew order, election protesters rejoice","TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Hondurans spilled into the streets of the capital on Monday night, banging pots and pans and joining rebel police in defiance of a curfew imposed after a presidential election that was heavily criticized by the Organization of American States. Some police officers abandoned their posts and joined carnival-like demonstrations that erupted across the city hours after night fell and the curfew was supposed to have begun.   A statement issued in the name of the National Police said the officers were upset with the government over a political crisis that was not their responsibility.  Our people are sovereign,  said a member of the elite Cobra riot police, reading the statement.  We cannot confront and repress their rights.  Authorities finished counting votes on Monday after a week of increasingly widespread criticism about the Nov. 26 election, with Organization of American States (OAS) lending credence to opposition claims the government manipulated the results to ensure a win.   The tight margin, along with the irregularities, errors and systematic problems that have surrounded this election, does not allow the mission to be certain about the results,  said former Bolivian President Jorge Quiroga, heading the OAS election observation mission in the Central American country. Electoral authorities said President Juan Orlando Hernandez won 42.98 percent of the vote, compared with opposition challenger Salvador Nasralla s 41.39 percent, based on 99.96 percent of ballot boxes tallied. However, authorities refrained from declaring a winner, with Nasralla s center-left opposition Alliance demanding a wide recount of nearly a third of votes, a request backed by the OAS and European Union election observers.  Lending more support to that view, a leader of rebellious Cobra riot police told reporters the country wanted a vote-by-vote recount to clarify the results, and called on the armed forces to come out in support of the police protest.  The Alliance, which claims that results sheets from ballot boxes were altered, is expected to formally contest the results.  President Hernandez, who has been praised by the United States for his crackdown on street gangs, also refrained from calling himself the winner on Monday, despite claiming victory several times since the election.    I make a call for peace, for brotherhood, for sanity, for national unity,  he told reporters. In a striking sign of support for Hernandez, 49, the U.S. State Department cleared the way for Honduras to receive millions of dollars in U.S. aid two days after the election, certifying that the government has been fighting corruption and upholding human rights, a document seen by Reuters showed. The government was struggling to contain the fallout from the chaos on Monday evening.  Even former TV star Nasralla joined a crowd of boisterous supporters, jumping up and down in a tan suit while flashing peace signs and joining a chant of  the dictatorship will fall,  a video posted on Twitter showed.  The additional powers granted to the army and police including the nighttime curfew from Friday were intended to stem the protests and have led to more than a thousand arrests. Up to 12 people have been killed in the protests or during the curfew. Tens of thousands peacefully took to the streets on Sunday in a show of force for the opposition. The police revolt began when more than 200 members of the Cobras refused to carry on battling protesters, saying it was tantamount to taking sides. Nasralla has repeatedly called on the security forces to ignore orders.  We are rebelling,  said one of the policemen, who covered his face in a ski mask and declined to give his name.  We call on all the police nationally to act with their conscience.  They soon had the support of other units, with reports that their protests had spread to other cities.  The police also said they were angry about the death of two colleagues shot while they were enforcing the curfew on Sunday night, an attack a spokesman said was unrelated to the election protests. Two civilian protesters were killed in the capital overnight, their relatives said, although authorities did not confirm the deaths. The OAS called for peaceful protests, said politicians must not incite violence and that security forces must respect human rights. Last week, at least three people were killed as soldiers broke up protesters  blockades. One police source and local reports said five more had been shot dead in the north of the country on Friday. The deaths have not been confirmed by authorities.  Early last week, Nasralla, a 64-year-old former sportscaster and game show host, appeared set for an upset victory, gaining a five-point lead with more than half of the ballots tallied. The counting process suddenly halted for more than a day and began leaning in favor of Hernandez after resuming.  Opposition leaders on Monday showed a sample of their own records of polling that did not match with the tribunal s. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro accused the United States of backing vote fraud in Honduras, while the U.S. embassy on Monday called for a  transparent, impartial, and opportune election result.  Honduras struggles with violent drug gangs, one of world s highest murder rates and endemic poverty, driving a tide of its people to migrate to the United States.   ",1.0
Russian MPs say anti-Russian agenda likely forced Flynn resignation,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Senior Russian lawmakers said on Tuesday the resignation of U.S. President Donald Trumps national security adviser showed that efforts were being made to undermine Russian-U.S. relations, but the Kremlin declined to comment. Michael Flynn resigned late on Monday after revelations he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office and misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. Its obvious that Flynn was forced to write the letter of resignation under a certain amount of pressure, Leonid Slutsky, head of the lower house of parliaments foreign affairs committee, was quoted as saying by the RIA news agency. Flynn was a strong advocate for the need for softer foreign policy toward Russia and his departure could slow Trumps pledge to improve relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The target was Russia-U.S. relations, undermining confidence in the new U.S. administration, Slutsky said, without specifying who he thought was responsible. Fellow lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev, who leads the upper house of parliaments international affairs committee, said the resignation could be a sign of growing anti-Russian feeling in the White House. Either Trump has not gained the requisite independence and he is gradually being (not unsuccessfully) backed into a corner, or Russophobia has already infected the new administration also from top to bottom, Kosachev said on social media. The Kremlin has denied that Flynn discussed lifting sanctions with the Russian envoy and on Tuesday it declined further comment, saying the resignation was an internal matter for the United States. Weve said everything we want to say, spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call. U.S.-Russia relations deteriorated to their worst level since the Cold War under the Obama administration, which slapped economic sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its involvement in Ukraines separatist conflict.

OBAMA USES WORLD STAGE To Announce Plans For Executive Action On Gun Control In U.S.,"How very progressive And how very ironic that our tyrannical President would take the opportunity to address how he plans to implement gun control in the U.S. while standing in Paris, where only two weeks ago 130 unarmed people were slaughtered by armed terrorists.Gun control, man-made climate change, open borders, one-world order just a few of the topics our anti-American President feels right at home discussing with a few comrades Speaking from Paris, France, on December 1, President Obama criticized the lack of gun control in the U.S. and pledged to remain focused on using executive action to enact new controls where possible.Obama is in Paris for a conference on climate change.During a press conference, Obama was asked about the November 27 Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood attack that killed two civilians and a police officer. He responded by claiming  mass shootings  are a something specifically American a problem not witnessed in other countries then criticized Congressional inaction toward passing more gun control.According to Bloomberg, Obama said:In the United States we have the power to do more to prevent what is just a regular process of gun homicides, that is unequaled by multiples of five, six, [or] ten, and I think the American people understand that. So my hope is that, once again, this spurs a conversation and action.He said that  Congress, states, and local governments  need to act, and he made it clear he  will continue to focus on what [he] can do administratively,  which is something he has been threatening to do since a gunman opened fire in the gun free zone at Umpqua Community College on October 1.On November 12 CBS News reported that Obama has given a team of  White House lawyers  the job of finding a way that executive action can be used to expand background checks. And Breitbart News reported that part of what is being sought is an arbitrary threshold that can be set on private gun sales. Citizens who sell more than the allowable level will be forced to do background checks on every sale.Obama and the Democrat Party have been obsessed with expanding background checks since Adam Lanza attacked Sandy Hook Elementary on December 14, 2012. Yet it is interesting to note that expanded background checks would not have hindered that attack in the slightest, because Lanza stole the guns he used he did not buy them.Moreover, background checks are already expanded in Colorado. Breitbart News previously reported that expanded background checks and a  high capacity  magazine ban are the law of the land in Colorado, but neither were effectual in stopping the Planned Parenthood attack or the high profile public shooting that took place in CO Springs on Halloween day.

DETROIT: IMMIGRANT STEALS $132 MILLION From MedicareOwns $7 Million Mansion With Indoor Basketball CourtDefense Lawyer Mohammed Nasser Says Hes Not a flight risk,"A health care executive cheated Medicare out of $132 million and blew the money on a $7 million Franklin mansion and courtside NBA tickets, and stuffed secret storage units with cash, prosecutors allege.Federal court records and prosecutors provided new details about the inner workings and riches of a health-care fraud conspiracy that ranks among the largest in Detroit history, orchestrated by 37-year-old businessman Mashiyat Rashid. Prosecutors say the conspiracy involved recruiting homeless people as patients, sending phony bills to Medicare, subjecting drug addicts to unnecessary back injections and prescribing powerful pain medication that ended up being sold on the street.The conspiracy generated so much money that Rashid withdrew $500,000 from a bank this month and stuffed the cash in a duffel bag, the government said. A surveillance team of federal agents watched him enter and leave the bank. This was a crime of deceit. His fraud was brazen,  Justice Department trial attorney Jacob Foster said Wednesday during Rashid s bond hearing.  This was about the thousands and thousands of beneficiaries who were taken advantage of in order for (Rashid) to line his pockets. Rashid, who lives in West Bloomfield Township, faces up to life in federal prison if convicted of crimes including health-care fraud conspiracy, money laundering and receiving kickbacks.Rashid is not a flight risk or a criminal, defense lawyer Mohammed Nasser said. He is a venture capitalist and business owner who paid $2.4 million in taxes last year. Rashid moved to the U.S. from Bangladesh when he was 3 years old, graduated from the University of Michigan, is married and has two young children. He doesn t have as much as a speeding ticket,  Nasser said.  He has had absolutely no involvement with the criminal justice system. This is his first parlay into the gamut of criminal law. We are confident this will be resolved. Rashid is a flight risk, U.S. Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Stafford said, noting his international travel, ties to Bangladesh and assets. She ordered Rashid held without bond pending an Aug. 22 trial. This is a uniquely troubling case in a lot of ways,  Stafford said.  The allegation is he basically forced people who may have been addicted to drugs to have unnecessary injections in their back as part of this scheme   things of that nature are very troubling. For entire story: Detroit NewsThe indictment unsealed Wednesday alleges the seven defendants conspired in a scheme involving $131.8 million.The alleged scheme involved paying kickbacks and bribes for services billed to Medicare.Only one of the seven people charged is an Ohio resident, the other six are MI residents.

" Heres The Democratic Plan To Destroy Trump, And Its Starting Soon (VIDEO)","Donald Trump has left a slime trail across multiple decades as a public figure, reality TV star, serial misogynist and now presidential candidate. During the Republican primaries, many wondered why his fellow candidate pulled their punches, often until it was too late and he had already secured the nomination.By contrast, Democrats don t seem as if they plan to let Trump get away with the same sort of shenanigans he did within the GOP. Hillary Clinton has already begun promoting web videos taking on Trump and his racist, sexist, misogynist comments. But the real advertising power is expected to come from the super PACs, who are able to accept an unlimited amount of money (thanks to the Citizens United decision).Priorities USA, who supported President Obama s re-election and produced ads attacking Mitt Romney s record at Bain Capital, will be up on the air in June with ads hitting Trump. Our job is to be as prepared as we can to take him on in any particular instance and that s why not only will we be up on June 8, as previously reported, but we re actually going to go on the air earlier,  Guy Cecil, the head of Priorities USA, told Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on Bloomberg Television s  With All Due Respect. Of the $91 million of air time the super-PAC has already reserved, Cecil estimates that roughly one quarter to one third of ads will be positive, with the rest painting Trump in a negative light.Cecil also estimated that about $40 million will be dedicated to online outreach targeting blacks, Latinos, the Democratic base and millennials.Cecil told Bloomberg that Priorities will be attacking Trump will highlight his smears of women, veterans, as well as his shady business dealings. The group will also be able to look at what worked and didn t work for Republican ads that went after Trump in the primaries for an idea of how best to attack him.Featured image via YouTube",0.0
 Giulianis Excuse For Forgetting 9/11 Is Just As Bad As Forgetting It (VIDEO),"After a decade and a half of peppering nearly every political conversation with   as Joe Biden famously said   a noun, a verb and 9/11, the mayor who was in charge of New York City during 9/11 appeared to forget it ever happened when he said that terrorism didn t hit our country until President Obama took office.After taking a day of brutal media and Twitter mockery, Giuliani offered an explanation. He just didn t have enough time to form the couple of extra words, like  since 9/11. I m not there to give a major 45-minute policy address,  he said of his Trump introduction Monday in Youngstown, Ohio, where he said plainly that  under those eight years, before Obama came along, we didn t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack inside the United States. You speak in somewhat abbreviated language,  Giuliani told The News Tuesday.  All human beings speak in abbreviated language at times. Source: New York Daily NewsEven this short video clip is a minute and 20 seconds long. He had plenty of time to talk about everything but 9/11.The idea that  all (terrorist attacks) started once Clinton and Obama came to office  is both false and offensive. The deadliest terrorist attack happened when Giuliani was in office, and many speculate that things would not have been so bad, especially for the first responders, under a different mayor.More than that, this is a dangerous lie. As of 2014, 3,158 people have died from terrorist attacks within the United States. Over 2,900 of those people died during the attacks of 9/11. Even with the addition of the San Bernardino shooting, far fewer than 100 people have died from terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, at least since Obama took office.Whether or not Giuliani actually forgot 9/11 is irrelevant. Donald Trump is trying to create an environment in which no one is held accountable for their words, and Giuliani is no exception. The new way of campaigning, at least for Trump s team, is to spit out ridiculous accusations and assertions and then blame the media for directly quoting them. Giuliani says he will slip up again, as we all will, but since he s on the Trump team, don t look for any sort of contrition. Look for doubling down and more lies.Featured image via Jeff Swensen at Getty Images. ",0.0

Hmmm I wonder if Barack had anything to do with the timing of the discovery of these emails? Dirty Chicago politics used against Chicago s hometown girl by their master community organizer  The Obama State Department suddenly discovered and turned over 1,300 pages of emails from former Ambassador Chris Stevens.The emails were delivered just two days before Hillary s testimony before the Benghazi committee.None of the seven previous congressional investigations on Benghazi had access to Ambassador Stevens  emails.

State, for example, only a few weeks ago gave the committee about 900 Libya-related emails from Clinton, which the committee says it asked for at the start of its investigation well over a year ago.

Winnie Mandela 'in high spirits' after minor surgery: spokesman,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African anti-apartheid veteran Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, ex-wife of the late President Nelson Mandela, is  in high spirits  after being admitted to hospital for minor surgery, her spokesman said on Thursday.

"BREAKING: CROOKED VA GOVERNOR, Close Hillary Friend Gave Wife Of FBI Official Overseeing Hillary Email Investigation $467,500","How much more criminal activity are American voters willing to overlook? Have we, as Americans gotten to the point that no crime committed by Hillary or anyone attached to Hillary will disqualify her from being elected to the highest office in our nation? Are we willing to accept that we can no longer trust anyone working for a government organization in America? The political organization of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, an influential Democrat with longstanding ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, gave nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an official at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who later helped oversee the investigation into Mrs. Clinton s email use.Campaign finance records show Mr. McAuliffe s political-action committee donated $467,500 to the 2015 state Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe, who is married to Andrew McCabe, now the deputy director of the FBI.The Virginia Democratic Party, over which Mr. McAuliffe exerts considerable control, donated an additional $207,788 worth of support to Dr. McCabe s campaign in the form of mailers, according to the records. That adds up to slightly more than $675,000 to her candidacy from entities either directly under Mr. McAuliffe s control or strongly influenced by him. The figure represents more than a third of all the campaign funds Dr. McCabe raised in the effort.Mr. McAuliffe and other state party leaders recruited Dr. McCabe to run, according to party officials. She lost the election to incumbent Republican Dick Black.A spokesman for the governor said he  supported Jill McCabe because he believed she would be a good state senator. This is a customary practice for Virginia governors  Any insinuation that his support was tied to anything other than his desire to elect candidates who would help pass his agenda is ridiculous. Among political candidates that year, Dr. McCabe was the third-largest recipient of funds from Common Good VA, the governor s PAC, according to campaign finance records. Dan Gecker received $781,500 from the PAC and $214,456 from the state party for a campaign that raised $2.9 million, according to records; and Jeremy McPike received $803,500 from the PAC and $535,162 from the state party, raising more $3.8 million that year for his candidacy.The governor could recall only one meeting with Mr. McCabe when he and other state Democrats met with the couple on March 7, 2015, to urge Dr. McCabe to run, according to the spokesman.The FBI said in a statement that during his wife s campaign Mr. McCabe  played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind. Months after the completion of her campaign, then-Associate Deputy Director McCabe was promoted to Deputy, where, in that position, he assumed for the first time, an oversight role in the investigation into Secretary Clinton s emails. FBI officials said that after that meeting with the governor in Richmond on March 7, Mr. McCabe sought ethics advice from the bureau and followed it, avoiding involvement with public corruption cases in Virginia, and avoiding any campaign activity or events.Mr. McCabe s supervision of the Clinton email case in 2016 wasn t seen as a conflict or an ethics issue because his wife s campaign was over by then and Mr. McAuliffe wasn t part of the email probe, officials said. Once I decided to run,  Dr. McCabe said,  my husband had no formal role in my campaign other than to be a supportive husband to me and our children. As a federal official everyone who participated in our campaign understood and respected that he could not participate. Mr. McCabe is a longtime FBI official who focused much of his career on terrorism. His wife is a hospital physician who campaigned in northern Virginia, where the couple live with their children.The 2015 Virginia State senate race was Dr. McCabe s first run for office and her campaign spent $1.8 million. The race was part of Mr. McAuliffe s failed effort to win a Democratic majority in the Virginia legislature, which would have given him significantly more sway in Richmond, the state capital.Mr. McAuliffe has been a central figure in the Clintons  political careers for decades. In the 1990s, he was Bill Clinton s chief fundraiser and he remains one of the couple s closest allies and public boosters. Mrs. Clinton appeared with him in northern Virginia in 2015 as he sought to increase the number of Democrats in the state legislature. For entire story: WSJ",0.0
BREAKING: HUGE LEGAL VICTORY FOR AMERICANS Who Were Told To Stop Speaking Out Against Obama [VIDEO],"A big slap in the face to an overreaching government who is more worried about protecting the reputations of our tyrannical president in public than our most basic right to free speech The Thomas More Law Center (TMLC), a national public interest law firm based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of the plaintiffs in August 2014, challenging the enactment of the ordinance which restricted the plaintiffs  right to demonstrate and display signs calling for the impeachment of President Obama and the end to illegal immigration on city overpasses over designated highways.U.S. District Judge David Godbey for the Northern District Court of Texas entered the consent judgment, marking the first time that the City of Dallas admitted its ordinance was an unconstitutional restriction on freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.Erin Mersino, TMLC Senior Trial Counsel handling the case, commented,  It is a good day for free speech. Overpasses for America and Valerie Villarreal may now resume their important demonstrations without fear of being fined or retaliated against by the City. We re asking our readers to consider making a donation (in any amount) to this amazing law firm who does so much to protect our freedoms from a tyrannical government: Donate to the Thomas More Law Center by clicking HEREIn November 2014, just three months after TMLC filed their initial lawsuit against the city, the Dallas City Council voted to repeal the ordinance. During the repeal process, however, the City refused to acknowledge that the ordinance unconstitutionally attacked Free Speech that criticized President Obama and the flood of illegal immigration encouraged by the Obama administration s complete disregard of federal immigration laws. The judgment entered by the District Court, however, specifically declares that the Dallas ordinance was a violation of Overpasses for America s First Amendment rights to free speech and free assembly. The judgment also awarded nominal damages as requested by the Plaintiffs in recognition of the City of Dallas  violation of the Overpasses members  Free Speech and Freedom of Assembly rights, and provided a settlement amount for attorneys  fees and costs.Before the enactment of the City s ordinance, the North Dallas Chapter of Overpasses for America had held over 75 demonstrations on the pedestrian overpasses in Dallas, without a single traffic incident. Nevertheless, the City Council moved forward with the restrictive ordinance under the guise that it was necessary for public safety.Overpasses for America is a nonpartisan grassroots movement that calls for accountability among our nation s leaders.Overpasses for America demonstrators frequently use pedestrian overpasses to spread their messages and to reach a large and diverse audience. Several cities, however, have sought to silence these concerned citizens.Richard Thompson, President and Chief Counsel of TMLC, stated:  The concerns of a majority of Americans on crucial public issues have little impact on the Washington political establishment.That s why it s so important to defend the free speech rights of grassroots organizations like Overpasses for America, whose members feel it s their patriotic duty to get their message out and mobilize their fellow citizens.

Czech PM Babis takes office but so far lacks parliamentary backing,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis, a billionaire businessman who ran on an anti-establishment ticket, took office with his cabinet on Wednesday, but it was unclear whether his tenure will survive a confidence vote next month. Babis, who built a business empire in food, farming, chemicals and media before entering politics in 2011, will have one month to gain confidence under the constitution for his minority government. He said after being formally appointed by Czech President Milos Zeman, that the confidence vote should take place on Jan. 10. Running on pledges to fight immigration and make the state more efficient, Babis s ANO party won 29.6 percent of the vote in an October national election that saw the rise of other parties preaching against the establishment. As finance minister over the past three years, Babis saw the central state budget swing to a surplus and has vowed to further cut public debt ratio to GDP, currently at a half of the European Union average. His problem is that ANO holds just 78 seats in the 200-seat lower house and does not have the firm backing of any of the other eight parties. The far-right, anti-EU SPD party and the far-left Communists have lent ANO support in initial parliamentary votes in return for committee posts, but no deal has been announced on their backing for the cabinet.  Babis will need a few parties to either support the cabinet or leave before the confidence vote to lower the threshold the government needs to pass. Babis s government includes non-partisan ministers, in line with his pledge to bring more managerial style to governance. His first tack will be representing the country at the European Union summit on Thursday and Friday, where he will push for strengthening EU borders and stopping illegal migration. If Babis loses the confidence vote, his government will stay in power until an alternative is formed. Zeman reiterated on Wednesday his willingness to give Babis a second try if the first attempt fails, and signaled this may be the way forward.  (I have) the impression that several (parties) wanted to be coaxed, but in order not to lose their dignity or prestige, they will want to be coaxed only in the second round,  Zeman said. Most parties have called for Babis himself to stay out of the government due to a police case looking at whether he illegally hid ownership of a farm and conference center a decade ago to get a 2 million euro ($2.35 million) EU subsidy meant for small businesses. Babis has denied any wrongdoing.  Some parties also criticize Babis for conflicts of interest as an owner of two national newspapers and a businessman whose firms have numerous contracts with the state and benefit from public aid. He placed his firms into a trust fund earlier this year, overseen by his close collaborators and his wife. Daily Hospodarske Noviny reported on Wednesday that the outgoing ruling party, the leftist Social Democrats, could support a Babis-led government in a second round of talks, if his first cabinet fails. It cited unnamed sources within that party. The other member of the outgoing coalition, the Christian Democrats, have also said they could negotiate with ANO. ",1.0
Abducted Swiss aid worker freed in Sudan's Darfur,"KHARTOUM (Reuters) - A 72-year-old Swiss aid worker was freed by security forces early on Wednesday more than a month after she was abducted in Sudan s Darfur region, officials said. Margaret Schenkel later flew back to the capital Khartoum, but did not give details of her ordeal to waiting journalists. She was kidnapped on Oct. 7 in the main city in North Darfur region, El Fasher, a hub for relief workers and U.N./African Union peacekeepers. Security forces launched an operation to free her from a rural area where she was being held outside the southern town of Kutum, a spokesman for the regional government said. The leader and one member of the six-man kidnapping gang had been arrested, Sudan s foreign ministry spokesman, Qarib al-Khidr, said. Neither Switzerland nor Sudan paid a ransom, he added. Khartoum has been at war with rebel groups in Darfur since 2003, but much of the conflict has descended into banditry and gangs have kidnapped people for ransom. The Swiss foreign ministry thanked Sudan for its help in freeing Schenkel. Officials have not named her aid group. ",1.0
"South Korea finds traces of radioactive gas, 'can't yet link it' to nuclear test","SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean nuclear experts, checking for contamination after North Korea s sixth and largest nuclear test, said on Friday they have found minute traces of radioactive xenon gas but that it was too early to specify its source. The Nuclear Safety and Security Commission (NSSC) said it had been conducting tests on land, air and water samples since shortly after North Korea s nuclear test on Sunday. The statement said the commission was analyzing  how the xenon entered South Korean territory and will make a decision at a later time whether the material is linked to North Korea s nuclear test . Xenon is a naturally occurring, colorless gas that is used in manufacturing of some sorts of lights. But the NSSC said it had detected xenon-133, a radioactive isotope that does not occur naturally and which has in the past been linked to North Korea s nuclear tests. There was no chance the xenon  will have an impact on South Korea s territory or population , the statement said. ",1.0
WOW! OBAMA MEDIA ALLY EXPOSES HUGE LIE: Why Obama Regime Cooked Intel On ISIS [VIDEO],"President Obama on ISIS: They re  a bunch of killers with good social media. They are dangerous and they ve caused great hardship to   an overwhelming majority of people.  Really Barry?  They ve caused a great hardship?  When someone you love has their head chopped off, or they re burned alive, or nailed to a cross and tortured, or when one of your young daughters is raped repeatedly and then taken away in a cage to be sold to the highest bidding Muslim pedophile as a sex slave do you call that a  hardship?  Because the rest of America calls it an evil that needs to be exterminated. And guess what Barry? We hired you to protect and defend the citizens of the United States from all enemies, foreign and domestic. We didn t hire you to start a war within our own country by manipulating our young sons and daughters in colleges and universities across America. Where did you get the idea that your top priority as our Commander in Chief was to divide our nation down lines of race and social class? Even the mainstream media is not going to sit back and allow you to lie about our enemies or skew intelligence to hide the fact you are a weak and incompetent leader. The idea that the NYT s would actually expose your lies makes us fear that the situation is even worse than what is being reported.Richard Haas, an American diplomat and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said on Monday there are serious implications if a recent New York Times report suggesting the Obama administration  cooked  intel on the Islamic State turns out to be true. I hope it s not true. I hope it s not true,  Haas said.  The principle requirement of intelligence analysts is to speak truth to power. It s not to make them comfortable, it s to make them smart and aware. He continued,  If it is true, it d be very interesting to know exactly where the pressure is coming from because it s corrosive. It means you can t then trust what policy is based on. So it is truly, truly a bad thing if, again, it is true.  Via: The BlazeMore from the New York Times report:The Pentagon s inspector general is investigating allegations that military officials have skewed intelligence assessments about the United States-led campaign in Iraq against the Islamic State to provide a more optimistic account of progress, according to several officials familiar with the inquiry.The investigation began after at least one civilian Defense Intelligence Agency analyst told the authorities that he had evidence that officials at United States Central Command   the military headquarters overseeing the American bombing campaign and other efforts against the Islamic State   were improperly reworking the conclusions of intelligence assessments prepared for policy makers, including President Obama, the government officials said.Fuller details of the claims were not available, including when the assessments were said to have been altered and who at Central Command, or Centcom, the analyst said was responsible. The officials, speaking only on the condition of anonymity about classified matters, said that the recently opened investigation focused on whether military officials had changed the conclusions of draft intelligence assessments during a review process and then passed them on.Haas also criticized the White House for downplaying the challenge of defeating the Islamic State in the face of the deadly Paris terrorist attacks.",0.0
BREAKING: TRUMP ANNOUNCES Nominee For Secretary Of StateLiberal Heads Explode!," Leading Republicans have already expressed anxieties about Tillerson, as they contend with intelligence assessments saying that Russia meddled in the U.S. presidential election to help turn the tables Trump s way.   FOX NewsThe RINOs will certainly join in with their concerns just like Marco Rubio did in a tweet: Being a  friend of Vladimir  is not an attribute I am hoping for from a #SecretaryOfState.    Sen. Marco RubioPresident-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he intends to nominate ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State.Tillerson impressed Trump during the two meetings he had with him. Trump had high praise for the energy titan, calling him a  world class player . He s in charge of an oil company that s pretty much double the size of his next nearest competitor,  Trump told host Chris Wallace.  It s been a company that s been unbelievably managed, and to me a great advantage is he knows many of the players and he knows them well. He does massive deals in Russia, he does massive deals for the company. Not for himself, for the company. Trump pointed to Tillerson s relations with Moscow and other political hot spots as a selling point. As ExxonMobil s chief, he maintained close ties with Russia and was awarded by Russian President Vladimir Putin with the Order of Friendship in 2013, a high honor for a foreign citizen.Read more: FOX ",0.0

TRUMP HITS BACK After Cowgirl Congresswoman Trashes Him Over Words Said to Grieving Widow,"The left is going ballistic over supposed words said by President Trump to a grieving military widow.  President Trump made a call to Myeshia Wilson that s been turned into a political football by the left to make Trump out to be  crazy . Wilson s husband was killed in Niger while serving in our military so President Trump was making a sympathy call to Mrs. Wilson. Unfortunately, Wilson s family has been put in the middle of an effort to bash Trump.The media also wasted no time covering this story. They re doing their best to try and make Trump look as bad as possible Just another day in the life of the lefty media.Far left Congresswoman  Frederica Wilson jumped right in to trash Trump after the call. She s following the left s narrative by claiming Trump is a  sick man .  It s pretty funny that Wilson calls Trump crazy while wearing a glittery cowgirl hat 24/7.The  Resist  movement includes Wilson who refused to go to Trump s inauguration. Wilson also attacked the president in May when she said said he  needs psychological help and is desperate for attention.  Perhaps Cowgirl Wilson should look in the mirror .According to left leaning propaganda news NBC: He said,  But you know he must ve known what he signed up for,  the Democrat recounted Trump saying more than once during the call to express his sympathy. According to Wilson, the conversation lasted somewhere from three to five minutes. Everyone knows when you go to war you could possibly not come back alive but you don t remind a grieving widow of that,  Wilson said.  That s so insensitive. Trump  didn t even remember his name,  Wilson recalled Myeshia Johnson telling her after the call ended, the congresswoman told MSNBC s  Morning Joe  Wednesday. She hung up the phone and said,  He didn t even remember his name,  Wilson said.  That s the hurting part. The White House said Tuesday that the president had called the families of all four service members who were killed.  He offered condolences on behalf of a grateful nation and assured them their family s extraordinary sacrifice to the country will never be forgotten,  the White House said.Asked about Wilson s characterization of the call, a White House official said Tuesday night that  the president s conversations with the families of American heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice are private. PETE HEGSETH POINTED OUT THAT THIS IS HOW FAR THE LEFT WILL GO TO TRASH TRUMP:Pete Hegseth said on  Fox & Friends  that this is another example of Trump s opponents taking every opportunity to twist or spin his words, even if it involves a fallen soldier. They want to question at every turn what he says he s committed to,  Hegseth said.  There s no one more committed, I believe, to our service members, to our veterans than this president. He said this shows how committed Democrats are to resisting Trump no matter what.TRUMP HITS BACK:Trump hit back at the claims saying he has proof of what was said on the call:Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2017Wilson took no time in shooting back that Trump is a  sick man . She s clearly milking this for all it s worth. It s sick that this Democrat would use this call to a grieving widow to bash our president.",0.0
MAN ROBS TAXPAYERS OF $1.4 Million In Food Stamp ScamUsing Fish!,"Feldman operates Upstate Fish, a market at 826 Joseph Ave. His father, Jack, a Holocaust survivor, opened the store under the name Jack s Modern Fish Market in 1954 and is a well-known figure in the community. A year ago, the elder Feldman was among a number of Holocaust survivors who had Hanukkah dinner with the Obamas and the president of Israel at the White House.Irving Feldman was accused of two different schemes, one netting more than $1.2 million and the other more than $200,000.The more lucrative scheme involved unlawfully buying $1,227,063 worth of food stamps from willing recipients for less than half their face value, according to the news release. The recipients received cash, and Feldman was able to reap a considerable profit by redeeming the food stamps with the federal government for their full value. This fish market owner was caught running a food stamp fraud scheme that was truly breathtaking in scale,  state Inspector General Catherine Leahy Scott said.Feldman also admitted to a second scheme in which he induced food stamp recipients to use their benefit cards to buy fish from other retail markets, then sell the fish to him at steeply discounted prices. The recipients pocketed cash, and Feldman got inventory he could sell at full value.The value of that scheme was about $202,000, the official statement said.Read more: DandC",0.0
 WATCH: Rep. Elijah Cummings Rips Republicans A New One For Witch Hunt Against Hillary,"House Republicans are spending much of their time and the taxpayers  money persecuting Hillary Clinton in order to sabotage her presidential campaign, and Rep. Elijah Cummings is sick of it.Over the last four days, Republicans have called three  emergency  hearings of the House Oversight Committee to investigate Hillary Clinton s emails despite the fact that FBI Director James Comey has already completely debunked GOP claims that she intentionally destroyed emails to hide something.During the third hearing on Tuesday, ranking committee member Rep. Elijah Cummings took Republicans and committee chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz to the woodshed  or engaging in these political witch hunts. Today is the third  emergency  hearing in four business days, third emergency hearing about Secretary Clinton s e-mails in four business days,  Cummings began.  Third in four days, emergency. I believe this committee is abusing taxpayer dollars and authority of Congress in an astonishing onslaught of political attacks to damage Secretary Clinton s campaign for president of the United States of America.  Cummings continued: This is the first time in my 30 years in Congress that I have personally witnessed the Oversight power of this committee abused in such a transparently political manner to directly influence a presidential campaign.The point of today s hearing is to investigate baseless Republican accusations that Secretary Clinton, or her aides, ordered destruction of emails to conceal them from investigators. The most important fact for the day s hearing is that the FBI already investigated these accusations and thoroughly debunked them. They interviewed witnesses, examined forensic evidence and concluded that these accusations have no merit. FBI Director (James) Comey stated, and I quote,  We found no evidence that any of the additional work-related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them,  end of quote. He went on to say, and I quote,  We did not find any evidence of evil intent, intent to obstruct justice. Cummings then described the strategy Republicans are using in order to continue to attack Hillary even though their charges have been proved to be untrue. Of course, Republicans did not like the answers that the FBI director gave, so they simply manufactured today s hearing out of thin air. This entire hearing is a contrived campaign photo-op.Step one: Publicly accuse the witnesses of criminal activity, no matter how ludicrous, then refer them to attorney s office for investigation.Step two: The next day invite the same witnesses to an emergency hearing on those criminal accusations and rush to issue a flurry of unilateral subpoenas demanding they testify. No debate, no vote.Step three: Express false outrage when these witnesses   this is a playbook   express false outrage when these witnesses, who you just accused of criminal activity take advice from their counsel to assert their Fifth Amendment right to not testify. There you have it   presto, instant photo op. Here s the video via YouTube.Republicans should pay a heavy price for relentlessly attacking Hillary Clinton in Congress like they have been doing over the years with their never-ending investigations into Benghazi and her emails. It s a total waste of money and time. But they would rather spend it on political persecution and character assassination instead of on dealing with real problems facing our nation.Featured image via screen capture",0.0
 RNC Mouthpiece Launches Petty Whinefest; Escalates Trumps Feud With The Media,"Sean Spicer is the former communications man for the Republican National Committee. He will also be joining the communications team for the upcoming Trump Administration, and he is getting a head start by stoking the fires of Trump s ongoing feud with the press. Speaking with The Hill, Spicer whined about how the media treats Trump. He began: There s some positive aspects here and there, but largely it still continues to not treat him with the respect that he deserves. I think for a lot of folks inside the beltway, and inside pundit-world, they don t fully appreciate the understanding that he has of where the American people are. They continue to mock him in ways, when it frankly just shows the lack of understanding that they have of where the American people are and what they think. Spicer then went on to whine about the positive coverage of Democrats in the press, saying: There are countless examples of the media engaging   overtly or covertly   cheering on Democrats and there s no accountability. But it s also not even frowned upon. The thing is, though, the press realizes what the Republican Party doesn t, which is that Trump is a petty, vengeful, lying, unqualified, corrupt Russian stooge who has duped just enough Americans in the right states to be elected president. That does not mean that he is deserving of respect, though. In fact, respect is earned, not given, and Trump has shown the media zero respect. Rightfully, they are giving it back in kind. He has not earned their respect, and therefore should not expect them to roll over and give it to him.Spicer then went on to give the press another reason to be frustrated with Trump, saying that the White House press briefings that they   and the American people   have become so accustomed to might not be the same in a Trump White House: It will be a daily something. When I say  something,  maybe it s a gaggle, maybe it s an on-camera briefing. Maybe we solicit talk radio and regional newspapers to submit questions   because they can t afford to be in Washington   but they still have a question. Maybe we just let the American people submit questions that we read off as well. This is most definitely vague, and when it comes to vague with Team Trump, that is an ominous sign, most likely.Spicer then said that he had spoken with former White House press secretaries, from both major parties, and said of them: Whether Republican or Democrat, every one of these predecessors has been unbelievably generous with their time, counsel and advice. The respect for the institution is one that is shared by all of them. Speaking of former Bill Clinton White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry s saying that perhaps these briefings should no longer be televised, Spicer said: I think his conclusion   his points are right. The second the cameras come on it becomes more of a show than an attempt to be more informative. So, in other words, they want to cut the American people off from knowing the day to day workings of our own government. The talk then turned to Trump s insistence on using Twitter for insults, policy announcements, and everything in between. Many Americans   including Trump s own supporters   believe he needs to stay off Twitter. Spicer, however, scoffed at this notion: I think this is nonsense. I really do. Because at the end of the day the American people want more than anything else is results. And success. And he s delivering already. And I think the American people   the people who have their jobs because of his actions   the taxpayers who have watched him save tax dollars, are appreciative, and I m not too sure they re concerned with the means by which he achieves that. So, in other words, we can look forward to the Tweeter-in-Chief. We already knew that, though. Spicer ended his remarks with words of caution to the press: Journalists and everyone in America has a Constitutional right to express themselves or write what they want to write. But he equally has a right to make sure that the record is set straight, the facts are known, and that people can t just take potshots without being held accountable. So, this war with the media will continue for the next four years. Considering Trump s thin-skinned, vengeful, vindictive nature, this could mean that he and his sycophants use the bully pulpit of the White House to bully journalists and dismantle the First Amendment. Scary times indeed, folks. #RESIST.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",0.0
 Bernie Sanders Just Crashed This Greedy Drug Companys Stock With One Tweet,"It appears that former Democratic presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders has tanked a drug company s stock with just one tweet. The tweet was directed towards Ariad Pharmaceuticals. Ariad owns a treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia calledIclusig . Ariad has raised the price of the drug four times in recent history.The last time the raised the price of the drug, it went up 27 percent at a cost of $16,560 dollars a month, or nearly $199,000 a year. The price hike doubled Ariad s sales totals up to $65 million dollars in just one quarter.The tweet that was sent out said: Drug corporations  greed is unbelievable. Ariad has raised the price of a leukemia drug to almost $199,000 a year. Drug corporations' greed is unbelievable. Ariad has raised the price of a leukemia drug to almost $199,000 a year. https://t.co/EB4nEPxP2G  Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) October 14, 2016The tweet also included a link to an article about the company s continual price increases.Bloomberg reports that after Sanders (or most likely one of his staffers) sent out the tweet, Ariad s stock value dropped by as much as 15 percent   one of the worst days the company has had in more than a year.At of the time this writing, the tweet doesn t appear to have gone viral compared to many of the Senator s other social media postings, with only 1.1k retweets and 1.5k likes. Though that may change as more attention to the story and Sanders  help in making the issue be known grows. Much in the same way that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton s tweet sent stocks crashing in the biotech industry after she spoke out against price gouging.Price-gouging in the pharmaceutical industry is a hot button issue. From Martin  Pharma bro  Shkreli and his raising the price of a certain AIDS medication made by Turing Pharmaceuticals, to Mylan s jacking the price up of EpiPens, people have raised the digital equivalents of torches and pitchforks over these price increases.It s important to keep in mind that this is a problem that is industry wide. One study found that prescription drug prices have been skyrocketing for more than five years. While drug companies that take part in the practice need to be called out and have the screws put on them by the public, the only way this problem is going to end is when people stand up and demand real change in the healthcare industry as a whole. That will probably mean switching to a national health care system   like every other developed nation on the planet.Featured image from Alex Wong/Getty Images with tweet screenshot added",0.0
Catalan secessionists mull snap election as Madrid hangs tough,"MADRID (Reuters) - Secessionist leaders in Catalonia may call a snap election in an attempt to break the deadlock with Madrid over independence, a senior local politician said on Tuesday, but Spanish authorities made clear that would not be enough. Spain says it will impose direct rule on Catalonia from Friday to prevent an illegal push for independence, invoking unprecedented powers to dismiss the regional government. Madrid said an election would not change those plans. The Catalan parliament meets on Thursday to agree on a response to Madrid, and many analysts believe the economically powerful region could formally declare independence.  Secessionists in Catalonia say their independence referendum on Oct. 1 - which attracted a 43 percent turnout and was mostly boycotted by those Catalans who want to remain in Spain - has given them a mandate for statehood. Catalonia said on Monday it was confident that its officials, including the police, would defy attempts by Madrid to enforce direct rule. Spanish political and business leaders, along with most Catalonian newspapers, have urged Catalan President Carles Puigdemont to call a regional election before he is stripped of his authority. They say direct rule from Madrid would be a humiliation for Catalonia and pose a serious risk of unrest. Puigdemont has so far remained silent on the matter of an election but an ally of his pro-independence government said he was actively considering this option.  We have evidence this is currently on the table,  Carles Riera, a Catalan lawmaker for the anti-capitalist CUP party, told a news conference. Calling an election would be a face-saving move for Puigdemont as it could either strengthen his mandate if pro-independence parties won or allow him a graceful exit if they did not. The Spanish government said a snap election would be a first step but Puigdemont would also have to withdraw an ambiguous declaration of independence he made earlier this month. The government had moved to cancel Catalonia s autonomous status because it believed there had been a  serious failure  by Puigdemont to meet his obligations, Justice Minister Rafael Catala said in a radio interview.  Everything is not fixed just by calling an election.  Catala said that if Puigdemont appeared before the Spanish Senate, it would help to resolve the crisis. A top official in the Senate said that if Puigdemont decided to appear before the house, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would likely come to the chamber as well so that a proper debate could be organised between the two. The Senate said on Tuesday it had invited Puigdemont to appear before the chamber on Thursday at 5 p.m (1500 GMT) or Friday at 10 a.m (0800 GMT). The Madrid government has so far refused to meet the Catalan leader until he drops his call for independence and Catala said any appearance by Puigdemont had to be within a legal and constitutional framework.   If his appearance is within the constitution and the law we ll be delighted ... But if it s just to ratify his position on Catalonia s independence, sadly we will not be able to do anything else than continuing with the measures already set by the government,  Catala said. The political uncertainty has taken its toll on Spain s wealthiest region, with hundreds of companies moving their headquarters out of Catalonia. Volkswagen s Spanish unit SEAT, one of the biggest employers in the region, said it would move its registered office if it felt there was no longer legal security in Catalonia, although it had so far not made a decision.  Relocating the registered office would respond to the need to seek legal protection, and would make sense the moment we felt it was no longer afforded in the territory where we are located,  SEAT Executive Committee Chairman Luca de Meo said in a letter to the company s more than 14,000 employees in the region.

 Trumps Response When Told He Should Stop Tweeting Makes Him Sound Like A Whiny Toddler,"Donald Trump s tweeting is a source of endless nightmares for Republicans and White House staff. They can try to sugarcoat anything Trump does, but it s hard to put a positive spin on the ramblings of a clearly troubled man. A typical Trump tweet shot off in the early morning may, say, contradict an official statement. Or prove a White House talking point is a lie. Or contain basic grammar and spelling mistakes. And some have even been used in court to rule against the White House s attempted Muslim ban.Adding to that, Trump s tweets are a visual, daily reminder that our president is, at his heart, a complete moron. Take this classic two-piece of idiocy, for example:First Trump proudly announces he plans on creating a cyber team with the country that hacked America s last presidential election.Putin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded..  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 9, 2017Hours later, he screams that it isn t happening after Americans of all political stripes pointed out how stupid the idea was.The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesn't mean I think it can happen. It can't-but a ceasefire can,& did!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 10, 2017His staff has privately told reporters that they spend a great deal of their time at the White House trying to find ways to get Trump to stop binge-watching Fox News and tweeting about whatever comes up on his favorite show, Fox and Friends. The struggle has, at times, descended into sheer lunacy.  During one of Trump s latest Twitter meltdowns, a despondent aide sent a reporter a simple message:Informed of the president s denial that he had recorded his conversations with Comey, a senior administration official replied,  At least that s behind us.  When alerted to his apparent suspicions of Oval Office surveillance, the official replied in a text message,  fml. What does Trump think about these attempts to save him from himself? It makes him angry.New York Times reporter Mark Leibovich filed a lengthy piece with a simple premise: The White House is a total-and-unending shitshow and Trump is at the epicenter. Leibovich was, in fact, in the room, when the idea of Trump s Twitter self-sabotage was brought up to the president. Trump s reaction speaks volumes.It was 12:30, but the president was not eating lunch. He was watching a recording of  Fox and Friends  from about four hours earlier on a large TV mounted on the wall. This was one of those stretches when Trump was tweeting a lot, including attacks on the mayor of London following a terrorist attack on the city the previous weekend. The tweets were becoming a growing topic of concern among Republicans, many of whom were urging him to stop. But like most reporters, I found his tweets far more illuminating than anything the White House press office could ever disgorge. I urged him to keep it up.Trump assured me that he would keep tweeting.  It s my voice,  Trump said of Twitter, enumerating how many millions of followers he had.  They want to take away my voice,  Trump said.  They re not going to take away my social media. In just two paragraphs, Leibovich documented Trump s insane Fox News viewing habits, the well-known patent dishonesty of the White House press office, and Trump s own spoiled brat way of looking at his Twitter habits. It takes Stephen King an entire novel to write anything half as scary as that snapshot of the man who currently controls America s nuclear arsenal.Featured image via Matt Cardy/Getty Images",0.0
"OBAMAS GUN-RUNNING, Lying, Race-Baiting AG Is BACKAnd Youll Never Guess Whose Job Hes Reportedly Hoping To Take In 2020 [VIDEO]","Please please please let it be a 3-way race between Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Eric Holder!Former Attorney General Eric Holder spoke in Los Angeles on Monday to promote a bill that some observers say would make California a  sanctuary state,  an appearance that he says is the start of a new phase of his career in which he plans to reenter the world of politics. Up to now, I have been more behind-the-scenes,  Holder told Yahoo News in a new interview published Tuesday, describing his plans.  But that s about to change. Holder, who served as former President Barack Obama s first attorney general, indicated that his goal is to head the legal resistance to President Donald Trump s agenda. But that may just be the tip of the iceberg.Three sources who have spoken to Holder and are familiar with his thinking told Yahoo that he may consider challenging Trump in 2020 for the White House. Now is the time to be more visible,  Holder said.  Now is the time to be heard. I have a certain status as the former attorney general. A certain familiarity as the first African-American attorney general. There s a justified perception that I m close to President Obama,  Holder added.  So I want to use whatever skills I have, whatever notoriety I have, to be effective in opposing things that are, at the end of the day, just bad for the country. Holder was getting paid $25,000 per month to serve as outside counsel to the heavily-Democratic California state legislature to counter the Trump administration. The legislation he supported Monday would prevent state police from helping to enforce immigration law, and Holder traveled across the country to promote it.  WFBEric Holder was one of the most controversial AG s in the history of the United States. He spent most of his first term under investigation while serving as Obama s Attorney General. He was the key figure in the Fast and Furious gun-running scandal with Mexico, and in 2012 Congress voted to hold him in contempt for not turning over documents on the Fast and Furious  gun-walking  scandal. He was also involved in the IRS scandal that targeted conservatives and conservative leaning organizations.Holder also was instrumental in fanning the flames of the Trayvon Martin case in Sanford, Florida. While he was acting as our nation s Attorney General, he was caught by Judicial Watch spending our taxpayer dollars to deploy a little-known unit of the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Community Relations Service (CRS)  to Sanford, FL, following the Trayvon Martin shooting to help organize and manage rallies and protests against George Zimmerman. Holder was also present in Ferguson where he did absolutely nothing to stop the rioting and chaos.Watch FOX News  Sean Hannity expose Obama s lying AG when asked about Fast n  Furious while under oath:Here s proof that Eric Holder was lying:",0.0
[Video] COLLEGE STUDENT BULLIED AFTER TAKING PICTURE OF White Privilege Board At Dorm," At first I was very surprised that this was in a dorm, because when I go into my dormitory I want to feel I m at home. So when I looked at the board, I instantly felt shameful for my heritage and my upbringing and for my life choices.   Mission accomplished.A student at Appalachian State University says she was cyber-bullied after she called out a dormitory s  Check Your Privilege  bulletin board.The board showed memes to depict so-called white privilege, heterosexual privilege, Christian privilege, and able-bodied privilege, among others.A female student, Laurel Littler, objected to the board s apparent shaming, so she posted a photo of it on her Facebook page and was surprised to receive some harsh responses.Her post was picked up by the website Campus Reform and after that, she says she was the victim of  tons of cyber-bullying. I read that because I m white, I had never experiences oppression before, so I deserved the cyber-bullying. It hurt at first, but after a while, I just realized these people don t know who I am and if they really do want to know my opinion, they re more than welcome to talk to me in person,  Littler told Elisabeth Hasselbeck this morning.The  privilege  board was put up by a resident assistant at the dormitory after three University of San Francisco professors started the  Check Your Privilege  campaign last fall.The R.A. reportedly does not plan to take it down.Littler said she doesn t want the board to be taken down, but posted it on Facebook out of a concern over the message. Fox and Friends  did not receive a response from the school on whether they plan to act to take the board down. Watch the interview above.Via: FOX NEWS",0.0

"Six police wounded, one killed in shootings near Indonesia's Freeport mine","JAKARTA (Reuters) - Six police were wounded and one killed in shootings that police alleged on Monday were carried out by a separatist group that aims to disrupt operations at the Grasberg copper and gold mine in Indonesia s eastern-most province of Papua.  Four of the shootings took place on Monday, while police were already investigating incidents that occurred over the weekend, including the fatal shooting of an officer in Timika on Sunday afternoon.  The armed group police say is behind the shootings has up to 30  separatist  members led by a man named Sabinus Waker.  The group has carried out earlier shootings in the mine area as well, Papua Police spokesman Suryadi Diaz told Reuters.       It s clear they want to disrupt operations at Freeport,  Diaz said.  Diaz said the group is  demanding justice  from the local unit of Freeport-McMoRan Inc, which operates the Grasberg mine, although it was not clear what that might entail.   Freeport is rich (and) has a big company. The population are poor,  Diaz said. It was not immediately possible to contact Waker, and it is not known if the group that police say is led by him has a spokesman or other representative.  A spokesman for Freeport s Indonesian unit said the recent shootings have had no impact on output from Grasberg, the world s second-biggest copper mine, but he declined to comment further.  Pro-independence rebels in Papua have waged a low-level conflict for decades, raising major concerns over security at Grasberg. Between 2009 and 2015, shootings within the mine project area killed 20 people and wounded 59.  To protect workers and infrastructure, Freeport contributed $21 million toward government-provided security in 2015.  Freeport has been grappling with labor problems at Grasberg and a lengthy dispute with Indonesia over rights to the giant mine that has cost both sides hundreds of millions of dollars.  ",1.0
 Maxine Waters Reveals The REAL Reason Pence Is Putting Up With Trumps Madness,"Donald Trump becomes more unhinged by the day. The week we just witnessed is his craziest yet. First, there was the hyper-partisan, free-wheeling speech he gave to a bunch of children at the Boy Scouts  Jamboree. The speech outraged so many people that the Boy Scouts of America had to apologize. Then, while speaking in front of police officers in Long Island, New York, Trump openly endorsed and encouraged police brutality in a racist speech sure to fire up his mouthbreathing base. And of course, there was the ouster of White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus via Twitter, who he humiliated as he was pushed out the door. To top it all off, he called for banning transgender soldiers from the military without even telling the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff first. This major, sweeping policy change was also made via Twitter.Through all of this madness, there were, of course, Trump s repeated and sustained attacks on his own Attorney General, Jeff Sessions. Even though this should have Republicans reeling with outrage, and some Capitol Hill Republicans have fired warning shots at Trump about Sessions, there is one person who has been suspiciously silent throughout the chaos: Mike Pence, Trump s second-in-command.Well, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) thinks she knows the reason for that. Taking to Twitter on Saturday evening, Rep. Waters said what anyone watching is likely thinking: Pence is just riding out the Trump insanity until the Republicans on Capitol Hill finally decide they ve had enough, and they pull the trigger on Trump. This, of course, would make Pence President. Here is that tweet:Mike Pence is somewhere planning an inauguration. Priebus and Spicer will lead the transition.  Maxine Waters (@MaxineWaters) July 30, 2017Rep. Waters is likely right. There s no way establishment Republicans like Mike Pence actually like living with Donald Trump as president. He is, and always has been, nothing more than a vehicle to put them in power. And honestly, because of the chaos, Trump has exactly zero legislative achievements. Sure, Jeff Sessions is doing awful things from the DOJ, but those horrific policies can be promptly reversed once a new administration arrives. Trump is ignorant, incompetent, and crazy. Pence, however, is much more dangerous. I can t believe I m saying this, but I truly hope Rep. Waters  predictions never come to pass. America will be an Evangelical theocracy in no time under Pence.In short, either way, America, we re screwed.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",0.0
CIA INSPECTOR: Hillary endangered lives FORMER JUDGE: Hillary Is A Prime candidate for prosecution,"Poor Hillary, she s always the victim of some Right-Wing conspiracy When members of Congress are not allowed to see the contents of the emails Hillary had on her private UNSECURED server that s a pretty big deal!The government intelligence in Hillary Clinton s private emails as secretary of state is sometimes considered so sensitive that some congressmen have been hindered in their ability to even read them, a new report Thursday says.The material in the emails is classified at a level above  top secret,  Fox reported, meaning that some lawmakers have been required to sign new agreements not to reveal their contents. The situation highlights the sensitivity of the information that is being pored over, despite Clinton s long habit of downplaying their significance.A level above  top secret  is considered subject to  special access programs,  requiring the additional security because of the increased sensitivity.Congressional reviewers who scoured the SAP information in Clinton s emails already had Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented clearance   the highest level of security clearance   but were required to sign extra non-disclosure agreements.Last week, Intelligence Community Inspector General I. Charles McCullough III wrote senior lawmakers to advise them that  several dozen  additional classified emails have been identified   including specific intelligence from special access programs. In a later interview with National Public Radio, Clinton downplayed the IG letter and claimed it was politically biased.  This seems to me to be, you know, another effort to inject this into the campaign, it s another leak,  she told the network.  I m just going to leave it up to the professionals at the Justice Department because nothing that this says changes the fact that I never sent or received material marked classified.

Syrian army and allies close in on Islamic State in Deir al-Zor,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian troops seized a suburb of the eastern city of Deir al-Zor on Sunday, tightening the noose around Islamic State, a Syrian military source said. The army pushed into the city this month with the help of Russian air power and Iran-backed militias, breaking an Islamic State siege of an enclave there that had lasted three years. On Sunday, the Syrian army and allied forces captured al-Jafra district on the western bank of the Euphrates river, the military source said.   They have no outlet except crossing the Euphrates towards the eastern bank and fleeing towards the desert, or (the towns) al-Bukamal and al-Mayadin,  the source told Reuters. Moscow and Washington are backing separate offensives in the oil-rich province of Deir al-Zor bordering Iraq. Both have advanced from opposite sides of the Euphrates which bisects the province, Islamic State s last major foothold in Syria. Russian- and U.S.-backed offensives against Islamic State have mostly stayed out of each other s way, with the Euphrates often acting as the dividing line. But the Pentagon accused Russia this week of bombing U.S.-backed forces on the river s eastern bank. Russia s Defence Ministry rejected the allegations on Sunday. Moscow had warned the United States well in advance of its operational plans and its jets only targeted Islamic State militants, it said.  Russia s RIA news agency cited an unnamed source as saying the Syrian army had cut Islamic State s main supply line in Deir al-Zor city.      The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said government forces took al-Jafra near the city s air base overnight, though Islamic State militants still hold nearly a third of the city.  Russian jets pounded movements across the river as Islamic State fighters tried to escape in ferries, and many civilians, including families of the militants, had also tried to flee across the river in recent days, it said. Separate air strikes by Russia and by the U.S.-led coalition killed more than 34 people, including children, across Deir al-Zor province over the past day, the war monitor said. Islamic State controls much of the desert region around Deir al-Zor city, where its fighters are also under attack from the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance. With jets and special forces from the U.S.-led coalition, the alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias is battling Islamic State in the northern parts of Deir al-Zor province. The SDF said it had taken 14 villages and farms, two towns, and some factories on the eastern bank of the Euphrates since launching its assault last week. ",1.0
OBAMA RACES TO SET GITMO TERRORISTS FREELeaves Servicemen Punished For Making Heat-of-the-battle decisions that saved lives In Fort Leavenworth,"It s hard to imagine a President who could be more anti-American and more pro-terror than Barack Hussein Obama. And then my mind drifts to Hillary and Benghazi The Obama administration is emptying the military s Guantanamo Bay detention facility of avowed terrorists captured fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, but several American service members languish in another military prison for actions on those same battlefields that their supporters say merit clemency, if not gratitude.Among the prison population at Fort Leavenworth, in Kansas, are remaining members of the so-called  Leavenworth 10,  convicted service members doing terms ranging from 10 to 40 years for heat-of-the-battle decisions their supporters say saved American lives.[quote_box_center] The very people who protect our freedoms and liberties are having their own freedoms and liberties taken away,  said retired U.S. Army Col. Allen West, a former congressman and political commentator.  I think it s appalling and no one is talking about this issue. [/quote_box_center]The  Leavenworth 10  is the name given to a fluctuating number of men housed at Leavenworth for actions in Iraq and Afghanistan that their supporters say were justified. Over the years, a handful have been paroled, and more have been incarcerated.Among the more well-known cases is that of Army First Lt. Clint Lorance, who is serving a 20-year sentence for ordering his men to shoot two suspected Taliban scouts in July 2012 in the Kandahar Province of Afghanistan. Lorance had just taken command of the platoon after the prior leader and several others were killed days before. The Taliban suspects were on motorcycles and matched descriptions given by a pilot who flew over the area earlier and spotted them as scouts.A Facebook page devoted to Lorance s case has drawn more than 12,000 likes, and supporters have launched a website, FreeClintLorance.com, dedicated to winning his release. A WhiteHouse.gov petition calling for Lorance to be pardoned garnered nearly 125,000 signatures, but the White House has not taken action.Critics say Lorance was given a military trial, and his conviction was based in large part on the testimony of men serving under him.It was September of 2010 when Sgt. Derrick Miller of Maryland, on a combat mission in a Taliban-held area of Afghanistan, was warned the unit s base had been penetrated. An Afghan suspected of being an enemy combatant was brought to Miller for interrogation and wound up dead. Miller claimed the suspect tried to grab his gun and that he shot him in self-defense. But he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.U.S. Army Master Sgt. John Hatley   a highly decorated, 20-year vet who served in Operation Desert Storm and did another three tours during the Iraq War   also is serving a life sentence at Leavenworth. His conviction stems from an April, 2007, incident in Iraq in which he and his unit captured enemies following a firefight. He radioed a U.S. detention facility to notify officials he was bringing in four prisoners, but was ordered to let them go, according to his legal team.Two years later, a sergeant who had served with Hatley, Jesse Cunningham, was facing charges for assaulting another officer and falling asleep at his post. As leverage for a plea deal, he told investigators that Hatley and two other officers had taken the insurgents to a remote location, blindfolded them and shot each in the back of the head. He claimed their bodies were dumped in a canal, though none was ever found.Hatley, now 47, insists he and his men let the insurgents go, but believes he was punished in the interest of the government s relations with Baghdad. When concerns over appeasing a foreign country are allowed to interfere with justice for the purpose of the U.S. government or the military demonstrating that we, the military or the U.S. government will hold our soldiers accountable using a fatally flawed military judicial system, it doesn t matter what the truth is; it matters only that there is only the appearance of the truth,  he wrote in a message to supporters posted on freeJohnHatley.com.Law experts say military service members face a daunting task once accused of committing crimes in the heat of war. Killing on the battlefield is not the same as [a police officer] killing someone on the streets,  Dan Conway, an attorney who specializes in military law, told FoxNews.com.  When a cop uses force, there s a line of duty investigation. When a soldier uses force, it is investigated as criminal, and non-infantry investigators handle the case, many who have no combat experience. If you had experts handling the investigation, you d have much more balance,  he added.While the military rightly holds its soldiers to a high standard of justice, detainees housed at Guantanamo Bay have been freed even with no mitigating circumstances or reasonable belief of rehabilitation. The release of Gitmo detainees began during the presidency of George W. Bush in 2005 when nearly 200 detainees were released before any tribunals were held.According to a March 2015 memo released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, of the 647 detainees transferred or released, 17.9 percent were confirmed of re-engaging in extremist activity with another 10.7 percent suspected of doing the same.

Exclusive: Skeptical Trump says would renegotiate global climate deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential contender Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would renegotiate Americas role in the U.N. global climate accord, spelling potential doom for an agreement many view as a last chance to turn the tide on global warming. A pull-out by the worlds second biggest carbon-emitting country would hobble the deal reached in Paris last December by nearly 200 nations, who for the first time in more than two decades found a common vision for curbing greenhouse gas emissions. I will be looking at that very, very seriously, and at a minimum I will be renegotiating those agreements, at a minimum. And at a maximum I may do something else, the New York real estate mogul said in an interview with Reuters.  But those agreements are one-sided agreements and they are bad for the United States. Trump said he did not believe China, the worlds top emitter of the carbon dioxide gas that many scientists believe is contributing to global climate change, would adhere to its pledge under the Paris deal. Not a big fan because other countries dont adhere to it, and China doesnt adhere to it, and Chinas spewing into the atmosphere, he said. The accord to transform the worlds fossil-fuel driven economy was a potent signal to investors.  It seeks to limit a rise in global temperatures to less than 2 degrees Celsius through combined national pledges to cut emissions, and provide funding for developing nations to mitigate the damaging effects of a sea level rise and climate change. The Obama administration pledged a 26 to 28 percent domestic reduction in greenhouse gases by 2025 compared to 2005, while China promised it would halt increases in carbon emissions by 2030. Both countries have promised to ratify the deal this year. Many U.S. Republicans have found fault with the deal for overreacting to what they see as an uncertain threat. Former French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, who helped broker the deal, said this month that the U.S. election was critical to its future. If a climate change denier was to be elected, it would threaten dramatically global action against climate disruption, he said. Trump has said that he believes global warming is a concept that was invented by China to hurt the competitiveness of U.S. business. One of his energy policy advisers is a climate change skeptic, U.S. Congressman Kevin Cramer of North Dakota. Hillary Clinton, the leading Democratic contender for the White House, has advocated shifting the country to 50 percent clean energy by 2030. Trumps comment drew fire from environmental advocates. This is another example of Trumps dangerous lack of judgment and the very real impacts it could have for all of us, said Gene Karpinski, president of the U.S.-based environmental group League of Conservation Voters.  Trumps denunciation of the Paris climate accord is not only short sighted, but would be terribly costly for America and our ability to lead the world. We cannot go backwards on this important step towards a clean energy economy that benefits all our families, billionaire environmental financier Tom Steyer said in a statement. The Paris agreement has an article built into it meant to protect countries in the accord in the event that a new government comes in and wants to dismantle it. The clause says any nation wanting to withdraw will first have to wait four years. U.S. chief climate envoy Jonathan Pershing said last week that regardless of the outcome of the U.S. election, other countries were likely to be bound by the pact. ",1.0
 SPINELESS: Paul Ryan Actually RAN AWAY From Reporters After Trumpcare FAIL (VIDEO),"Everyone knows Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has absolutely no backbone, but what he did yesterday was an entirely new low for the Republican Party.Yesterday was a disaster for the GOP to begin with. Donald Trump pathetically failed to gain enough votes for the disastrous American Health Care Act, and the GOP suffered a major humiliation as the glorious plan they ve been promising to implement and do away with Obamacare with for the past seven years deteriorates before their eyes. After such a horrible, embarrassing day, it was clear that Ryan didn t have it in him to face the press and answer the many critical questions that Americans have about Trumpcare.Ryan emerged from the failed discussions over Trumpcare, visibly frustrated and not in the mood to make nice with reporters. He gave a short statement in which he was clearly angry and uncomfortable: For seven and a half years, we have been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law because it s collapsing and it s failing families, and tomorrow we re proceeding. He ended his address abruptly, literally running off and away from reporters demanding answers. You can watch this disgusting behavior below, courtesy of the Rachel Maddow Show: This is clearly a sign that the GOP knows how badly they ve just failed, and they re aware of how pathetic the party looks right now. This could not be a more painful time for the GOP   their disastrous reality television star of a candidate won the election and even though he s only been in the White House a little more than two months, he s f*cked things up more than anyone thought he would. With Trump s help, the Republican Party has done irreversible damage to its reputation   and they only have themselves to thank. Ryan s cowardly behavior only solidifies the fact that the GOP is crumbling before our very eyes.Featured image via screenshot",0.0
GREEN PARTY DOLT Struggles To Explain Wisconsin Election Recount [Video],"IAN JACKSON: People have been slightly concerned about the trail and as your last guest pointed out it s very decentralized.ED HENRYY: Uh-huh. When you say  slightly concerned,  that doesn t sound to me like there s widespread allegations or more importantly evidence of some sort of fraud. So is this giving Jill Stein supporters some sort of false hope?JACKSON: Well, I [pause] there s we re [pause] trying to find what the count is and [pause] I m not sure it s false hope. It s trying to find the truth behind the numbers. There has been these allegations by computer scientists but as your last guest pointed out, it was using different systems and using that, being engineers, um, I m a software engineer and we like our little [pause] models, but unless you actually count and check it, you don t know whether it s just a thoughy well, they used something different or if there s something to it.And you mentioned your show is all about finding truth.HENRY: Let s find that truth. My next question is, our last guest, who you cited several times, Craig Gilbert, also said, accurately, that in 2000 and 2004 the margin was even closer in the presidential race and there was no recount. So what s your case tonight?JACKSON: [pause] Well, the case [pause] tonight, you can see that there that was [pause] a real contentious election [pause], and, based on that there are people that have expressed concerns. So, it s best to find the truth and go through the process. And obviously people have been willing to put up millions of dollars [pause] to find out and count the ballots again.HENRY: Okay, so final question: if you really want to get at the truth can we get at another truth which is that it appears that Jill Stein has raised about $5 million for a recount that may or may not happen for fraud that may or may not have happened. If there s nothing found here and if there s not even a recount will you pledge tonight that you and others in the Green Party believe that that money should be refunded, so this is not just money being raised on false hope?JACKSON: Well, we re exploring that I m only treasurer for the Green-Rainbow party. We re certainly going   if it doesn t get used, we re certainly going to discuss with our donors what their desire is for that money. ",0.0
" Harry Reid Storms The Senate, UNLEASHES On GOP And It Was F*cking AWESOME (VIDEO)","On Thursday, while Republican leadership was meeting with Donald Trump, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid unleashed on the GOP for pandering to their atrocious nominee. The first thing Reid did when he spoke was to make sure that every American who watched his speech knows that the right-wing is  marching lock-step with Donald Trump  and their policies are perfectly aligned: So, McConnell has fully embraced Donald Trump. As he said last week when Trump secured the Republican nomination, I quote, I have committed to supporting the nominee chosen by Republican voters,  closed quote. While speaking with reporters earlier this week the Republican leader sounded enthusiastic about Trump s chances in the general election. I guess he should be giddy about a Trump presidency, Donald Trump is everything that the Republican leader and his party could ever want in a nomination. That is absolutely, 100 percent spot-on. We have been saying the same thing since the beginning. The Republican base is filled with racist, misogynistic, Islamaphobic xenophobes who hate everyone who isn t a straight, white, Christian male. After explaining how much the GOP loves Trump, he hit them about their Supreme Court obstruction. Then Senator Reid pointed out how much the GOP hates women: Let s talk about Trump and women. When they get together, they can talk about their policies about being anti-woman. Since Sen. McConnell has so enthusiastically embraced Trump, we can only assume he agrees with Trump s view that women are dogs and pigs. We can only assume that the Republican Leader is not repulsed by Donald Trump s vulgar behavior towards women. Look at his New York Times story yesterday on his cavorting with Howard Stern and how they talked about women. After all, the Republican Party has spent years blocking every substantive bill for American women. Equal pay for equal work. The Senator has tried to undermine women s health at every turn. Trying to turn Planned Parenthood into a punching bag, even though millions and millions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood. The minority leader went on to say that McConnell must also agree with Trump s views on immigrants; after all, the GOP has been saying the same thing about them for years. He hit Republicans for claiming they care about immigration control, but came within hours of shutting down the Department of Homeland Security. The senator said that he  can only assume  that Mitch McConnell and the leadership are okay with Trump s  shady business practices  and  ripping off  hardworking Americans.Reid slammed the GOP for Trump s bankruptcies, their climate change bullshit, their horrible fiscal policies, Trump wanting to default on America s debt and a number of other things. He spent more than eight minutes ripping Republican leadership and it was amazing. It was also terrifying. If Donald Trump is elected in November, this country is screwed. Our children will be left with a mess of epic proportions and our older kids will probably be sent to war. There is literally nothing good that could come with putting a member of the GOP in the White House. So, remember to vote blue, no matter who.Watch Reid rip the GOP apart:Featured image via video screenshot",0.0
Top U.S. intelligence Democrat blasts White House over Nunes documents,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee blasted the White House on Tuesday for playing a role in selectively and surreptitiously providing documents to committee chairman Devin Nunes. If the White House had any concerns over these documents, or any other documents, they should have provided them to our committee weeks ago, Representative Adam Schiff said in a statement.

House panel to unveil self-driving car legislation soon: aide,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Republicans expect to introduce bills later this week that would bar states from setting their own rules for self-driving cars and take other steps to remove obstacles to putting such vehicles on the road, a spokeswoman said. The legislative action comes as major automakers are joining forces with auto suppliers and other groups to prod Congress into action. Last month, a U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce subcommittee held a hearing on a Republican draft package of 14 bills that would allow U.S. regulators to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles a year per manufacturer from federal motor vehicle safety rules that prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls. Blair Ellis, a spokeswoman for the committee, said on Monday it was likely that legislation would be introduced this week and a formal hearing on the bills would occur next week.  Republican U.S. Representative Robert Latta said last month he hoped to win committee approval of a bipartisan legislative package by the end of July. The draft measures would bar states from setting self-driving rules and prevent the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from pre-approving self-driving car technologies. Democrats say the NHTSA must play a more aggressive role in mandating self-driving car safety. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a group representing General Motors Co (GM.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and others, and the Association of Global Automakers, representing major foreign automakers including Honda Motor Co (7267.T) and Hyundai Motor Corp (005380.KS), are forming the Coalition for Future Mobility to press Congress to act. The group, which includes the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, National Federation of the Blind and Securing Americas Future Energy, a group of corporate officials and retired military leaders, plans to begin airing radio ads on Tuesday portraying the legislation as liberating innovation for self-driving vehicles. GM, Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment. The administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars. President Donald Trumps transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, has said she plans to quickly update those.   ",1.0
" Sean Spicer Has INSANE MELTDOWN, Gets Hostile With Reporters In Off-Camera Briefing (DETAILS)","White House press secretary Sean Spicer has been known for losing his sh*t, just like his boss Donald Trump   and in an off-camera news briefing on Monday, Spicer had a Trump-sized meltdown as he tried to defend the disgraceful POTUS from his self-created wiretapping debacle.PBS News Hour caught Spicer railing against the media on a live audio stream, capturing Spicer taking a particularly hostile and defensive attitude with reporters as they asked questions about Trump s unverified claims that former President Barack Obama had somehow tapped his phones at the Trump Tower.At the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Trump had blasted the media for using anonymous sources (even though he often does), and even suggested that the media  shouldn t be allowed  to cite anonymous sources. Reporters asked Spicer about Trump s anti-media comments at the CPAC, but this quickly launched into a discussion about Trump s recent accusations against Obama, as well as inquiries about what evidence Trump had to back this up. Spicer responded: People start taking things as fact because a series of off-the-record and anonymous sources   We have started to become a series of believing all these stories, and yet, I ve addressed this in the past, there s nothing there to substantiate. At some point, I would ask people to take on-the-record sources and quotes as important as the countless numbers of anonymous, off-the records. As things heated up, one reporter asked for the source that Trump had gotten his information from regarding the wiretapping. The reporter asked: So, explain this to me then. You re talking about not using anonymous sources   what is, then, the sourcing of the president s tweet on Saturday? Does he believe it s a FISA warrant? That s when poor Spicey lost it. As more reporters tried to join the conversation, the WH press secretary snapped and said: There s no cameras. You can slow it down. And of course, just like the hypocrite he is, Spicer couldn t provide a non-anonymous source. He simply said that reports are out there  from  individuals and sources. Understandably, the reporters wanted more of an answer so they continues to press Spicer. This caused him to fire back again as he said: You re not on camera. You don t need to jump in. You can watch Spicer lost his temper over some straightforward, simple questions below:Featured image via Aaron P. Bernstein / Getty Images",0.0
 Warren Buffett Knows Exactly Why Trumps Campaign Is Broke,"Warren Buffet, one of the richest men in the world and someone who actually does know a lot about money, has known this whole time what drove Trump s campaign finances into the ground. He didn t say as much, because at the time Buffett revealed this, it was 1991 and he was talking about Trump s bankrupt Taj Mahal. What he said then can apply now, though, and the state of Trump s campaign finances backs it up.Back when Trump filed for bankruptcy on the Taj Mahal, Buffett was giving speeches to undergrad students at Notre Dame when someone asked him where Trump went wrong. Buffett said: He simply got infatuated with how much money he could borrow, and he did not give enough thought to how much money he could pay back. That s so Trump, especially when faced with the possibility that he can t do what he wants because of consequences. So is this: The big problem with Donald Trump was he never went right. He basically overpaid for properties, but he got people to lend him the money. He was terrific at borrowing money. If you look at his assets, and what he paid for them, and what he borrowed to get them, there was never any real equity there. No, he never did go right. Trump has six bankruptcies total in his history, which is a lot, even over 25 years. He owes at least $100 million to Deutsche Bank. One has to wonder whether he got over his infatuation with borrowing, or whether he learned anything from his bankruptcies. He certainly hasn t learned to think about the consequences of anything he does.His campaign is more than $40 million in the hole with just over $1 million in the bank, and he just sent out his first desperate email begging his constituents for money. He ll need those donations to keep his campaign running, not pay off debt. Perhaps he thinks the debt will walk quietly away?This is significant because, if he s as in love with debt as he is with himself, he very well could make our national debt skyrocket despite his more than impossible promise to have it paid off within eight years. He s far more likely to actually bankrupt the U.S. than any other candidate if he s mired in this notion that he can borrow money indiscriminately.Buffett and Trump are polar opposites in the way they do business, and even in the way they see government. For instance, Trump has bragged about the low tax rate he pays, as if that s something to be proud of when the government is talking about cutting needed services because there isn t enough money. Buffett, on the other hand, has called for higher taxes on the wealthy repeatedly.That makes Buffett the smart one of these two, but then, we already knew that.Trump keeps saying he can change his tune anytime he wants, but the few paltry efforts he s made have failed spectacularly within just a few days. It s a good bet that he ll remain addicted to borrowing money, even as president. He has his eye on the prize, and the prize is a destroyed U.S., and a fat wallet for himself.Featured image by Paul Morigi/Getty Images",0.0
"Trumps Foreign Policy: Promote Stability NOT Change, Stop Helping Terrorists","21st Century Wire says We are sure that the military industrial complex is not at all happy about the prospect of using diplomacy before cruise missiles.In Donald Trump s foreign policy speech today he made numerous points that would lead us to believe that his stance on this area of policy will be radically different to what has become the norm.Aside from the usual campaign rhetoric of ensuring America has the strongest military on the planet, Trump made numerous points clearly stating that the military option will not be his first option.Trump specifically spoke of being very careful as to whom the US assists, particularly in the Middle East, and to only help those who are true allies, which is a clear stab at recent policies to arm and support terrorist groups to overthrow nations like Libya and Syria.He also explicitly stated that the US needs to  stop seeking radical change in the world , and instead look to promote stability through diplomacy saying: Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction. The presidential hopeful is also looking to drastically cool off the rising tensions with Russia. He called out so-called foreign policy experts for ruining the situation, and said: Easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia is absolutely possible. It would be easy to dismiss all of these statements as nothing but campaign rhetoric, but Trump appears to be positioning himself as the master dealmaker. He has nothing to gain from being a warmonger, as he is not tied to the military industrial complex interests like establishment candidates, so there is no real reason to doubt this anti-interventionist stance.Watch Donald Trump s full foreign policy speech here: ",0.0
 Spicer Quickly Orders Press Briefing To Be OFF Camera After Trumps Indefensible Morning Meltdown,"Watching the healthcare bill he staked his entire presidency on flame out in the Senate seems to have broken Trump s brain. Within 24 hours, he was on Twitter having a spittle-laden meltdown over the negative coverage he s been receiving. Two articles   one by the New York Times and the other by the Washington Post   seem to have pushed him over the edge.First, there was the New York Times, which found a number of Senate Republicans willing to call him a moron:Senate Republican leadership has made it known that it would much rather negotiate with Mr. Pence than a president whose candidacy many did not even take seriously during the 2016 primaries. And some of the White House s efforts have clearly been counterproductive.Then there was the Washington Post, which discovered that Trump had photoshopped a picture of himself onto the cover TIME magazine and hung it in his golf courses.The framed copy of Time magazine was hung up in at least five of President Trump s clubs, from South Florida to Scotland. Filling the entire cover was a photo of Donald Trump. Donald Trump: The  Apprentice  is a television smash!  the big headline said. Above the Time nameplate, there was another headline in all caps:  TRUMP IS HITTING ON ALL FRONTS . . . EVEN TV! But that wasn t true.The Time cover is a fake.There was no March 1, 2009, issue of Time magazine. And there was no issue at all in 2009 that had Trump on the cover.So Trump being Trump promptly lost his mind.The failing @nytimes writes false story after false story about me. They don't even call to verify the facts of a story. A Fake News Joke!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 28, 2017The #AmazonWashingtonPost, sometimes referred to as the guardian of Amazon not paying internet taxes (which they should) is FAKE NEWS!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 28, 2017Trump s attack on the Washington Post was particularly insane, not just because he seemingly invented the term  guardian of Amazon,  but that he demanded Amazon pay a non-existent  internet tax    the price for Amazon s owner also owning the Washington Post. It s how a particularly nasty dictator in a particularly nasty banana republic might behave. Hate the message, go after the messenger and everyone the messenger associates with. It confirms much of what Trump s critics have been saying: Trump is at war with the free press.How will the administration defend Trump s meltdown? By hiding. Sean Spicer ran into the metaphorical bushes, quickly releasing a  revised  press briefing schedule that demanded no cameras be allowed to film.White House briefing today: Off camera with @PressSec pic.twitter.com/fyBLIUmdj5  Jeremy Diamond (@JDiamond1) June 28, 2017When it comes down to it, even Sean Spicer seems to know that the president s actions and comments are indefensible. He s banking on the fact that if he isn t filmed, perhaps history will forget his humiliating role in this administration.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",0.0
"Haley: Women accusers should be heard, even if Trump is target","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said on Sunday that any woman who has felt violated or mistreated by a man has every right to speak up, even if she is accusing President Donald Trump. Women who accuse anyone should be heard, Haley said on CBSs Face the Nation. They should be heard, and they should be dealt with. Washington has been roiled by sexual misconduct scandals, with accusations leading to the resignations last week of three members of Congress. The growing wave of women reporting abuse or misconduct has brought down powerful men, from movie producer Harvey Weinstein to popular television personality Matt Lauer. Haley, discussing that cultural shift, applauded the women who have come forward: Im proud of their strength. Im proud of their courage. Asked how people should assess the accusers of the president, Haley said, it was the same thing. More than 10 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct before he was president. While filming a segment of the television program Access Hollywood, he talked about kissing and groping women. Trump has denied the misconduct allegations, although he apologized for his comments, which he called locker room talk. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Thursday that sexual harassment allegations against Trump were addressed by the American people when they voted him into office in November 2016. Asked whether Trumps election settled the matter, Haley said: Thats for the people to decide. I know that he was elected, but women should always feel comfortable coming forward, and we should all be willing to listen to them. On Tuesday, voters in the heavily Republican state of Alabama will cast their ballots in a race involving Republican Roy Moore, a former state judge, and Democrat Doug Jones, a former U.S. attorney. Moore has been accused of sexual misconduct toward women when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. One woman said he tried to initiate sexual contact with her when she was 14. Reuters has not independently verified the accusations, which Moore, a conservative Christian, has denied. Many Republicans, including Alabamas senior U.S. senator, Richard Shelby, have distanced themselves from Moore. But Trump has endorsed him, saying he wants to see the Senate seat stay in Republicans hands. ",1.0
"After ruling, Virginia legislature's majority to be chosen by lot","(Reuters) - Republicans could hold onto control of Virginias legislature after a race that had appeared to change the balance of power was ruled a tie on Wednesday, setting the stage for the winner of the district to be chosen by lot. The results of a recount on Tuesday showed Democrat Shelly Simonds beating Republican incumbent David Yancey by one vote, enough to shift the 100-member House of Delegates to an even 50-50 split between Democrats and Republicans. However, on Wednesday a three-judge panel ruled that a disputed ballot should be counted for Yancey, the Virginian-Pilot newspaper reported and Yancey confirmed. The two candidates in the 94th District, which includes Newport News in southeastern Virginia, are now tied at 11,608 votes. Under Virginia law, a tie in a House race should be decided by drawing lots, the equivalent of a coin toss or drawing straws, the Conference of State Legislatures said. I am happy that every vote in Newport News was counted and that the judges took time to deliberate before rendering a decision, Yancey said in an emailed statement. This certainly is a historic election in our Commonwealth. But Democrats slammed the decision, calling it erroneous and saying they were considering legal action to challenge it. Just Tuesday, Republicans conceded the seat, and Simonds, who made international news with what had appeared to be a narrow win, spent the morning Wednesday discussing the race on a variety of news shows. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment following Wednesdays decision, but an attorney for the Virginia House Democratic Caucus criticized the judges move in a news release. Todays decision by the court was wrong, and Delegate-elect Shelly Simonds should have been certified the winner, he said. We are currently assessing all legal options before us as we fight for a just result.  Democrats claimed historic gains in Virginias statehouse last month, part of the partys first big wave of victories since Republican Donald Trump won the White House last year. Before the Nov. 7 general election, Virginia Republicans held 66 seats to the Democrats 34 in the House of Delegates, along with a majority in the state Senate.  ",1.0
Turkish PM says Trump victory a chance to advance relations with U.S,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim on Wednesday congratulated Donald Trump on his victory in the U.S. presidential election, saying it was an opportunity to further bilateral relations. In a speech in the capital Ankara, Yildirim said a new page would be opened in U.S.-Turkey relations if Washington extradited the U.S.-based cleric Turkey blames for orchestrating the July 15 failed coup. An area of opportunity has been created for the new president to advance relations with policies taking into account Turkeys fight against terror, Yildirim said. ",1.0

U.S. allies fret as 'guillotine' hangs over Tillerson,"BRUSSELS/BERLIN (Reuters) - On the eve of his trip to Europe, Rex Tillerson gave a speech last week that European allies had waited months to hear: an ironclad promise of U.S. support to its oldest allies. The relief in European capitals lasted barely a day as reports surfaced of a White House plan to oust the U.S. secretary of state, plunging Americas friends back into confusion over President Donald Trumps foreign policy. The uncertainty is particularly acute given Washingtons leading role in crises in North Korea and Syria. Just as Tillerson comes to Brussels to give a public statement of support that the EU and NATO have wanted all along, it seems he has no mandate, that the guillotine is hanging over his head, said an EU official involved in diplomacy with White House officials. It leaves Europe just as doubtful as before about Trump. U.S. officials said on Thursday the White House had a plan for CIA Director Mike Pompeo to replace Tillerson but Trump said on Friday he was not leaving and the secretary of state said on Saturday the reports were untrue. European leaders yearn for stability in U.S. foreign policy. They are troubled by Trumps America first rhetoric and inconsistent statements on NATO and the European Union. In addition, Trumps decision to pull out of the Paris climate change accord and his decision not to certify Irans compliance with a nuclear deal undermine European priorities. The chaos in the administration doesnt help in the current geopolitical climate, said a senior French diplomat. Early last week, Tillerson, a former Exxon Mobil chief executive, delivered a long address in support of Europe in Washington more akin to traditional U.S. policy. The United States remains committed to our enduring relationship with Europe. Our security commitments to European allies are ironclad, he told a think tank.  He said he would convey that message to the European Union and NATO. He is set to visit Brussels on Tuesday and Wednesday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Vienna on Thursday and Paris on Friday. The question is whether European officials believe him, given tensions during his April visit to Europe, when Reuters reported Tillerson initially planned to skip a NATO meeting in Brussels and then only attended under pressure from allies. If there were expectations that Tillerson might evolve into a counterweight to Trump, someone who could pass on messages from partners and exert moderating influence over American foreign policy  those expectations have been disappointed, said Niels Annen, foreign policy spokesman for Germanys Social Democrats in parliament. On his watch, the State Department has become a non-actor. Despite Tillersons pledge to reform the U.S. foreign service, European governments take a dim view of how he has sought to cut costs at the State Department, with top diplomatic posts unfilled almost a year into the administration.  The French have gone around Tillerson to develop contacts with U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, while the EUs top diplomat Federica Mogherini has gone directly to Vice President Mike Pence. Berlin has focused on Capitol Hill, as well as Kelly, McMaster and Mattis. Yet it is unclear if that access translates into a direct impact on Trumps foreign policy, diplomats said. There is hope that if Pompeo is appointed he could rejuvenate the State Department after Tillerson, who is seen as ineffective, diplomats said. Pompeo is an unknown quantity in Europe but is viewed as closer to Trump. We may be looking at a larger dose of Trump at the State Department, if Pompeo did get the job, said Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, head of the German Marshall Funds Berlin office. One European diplomat said Tillerson was in a difficult position from the outset because the Trump administration was hostile to Iran and brought in a team of generals who took a hard line, so it never left Tillerson much room. In addition, Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner has taken a leading role in formulating policy on Middle East peace. But Europeans see Trump as a blizzard of conflicting signals. At a NATO summit in Brussels in May, the president publicly admonished European leaders for their low defense spending and threatened to reduce support, only to announce a jump in U.S. military spending in Europe months later. Things may only become more unpredictable, diplomats say. European diplomats see Tillerson and Mattis as instrumental in talking Trump out of making any rash decisions over North Korea and its nuclear program, given administration comments about utterly destroying the country.

Senior Saudi prince says Trump's Jerusalem move threatens stability,"RIYADH (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital will stoke violence in the region, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal said, dismissing reports of prior consultations made with Riyadh over the move.   It is a very bad decision. The consequences will be more bloodshed, more conflict rather than peaceful resolution,  Prince Turki, a senior royal family member and a former ambassador to Washington, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday in Riyadh. Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy and veered from international consensus this month by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Most countries say the city s status must be left to negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Saudi Arabia condemned the decision. Saudi King Salman told President Trump that any decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem before a permanent peace settlement is reached will inflame the feelings of Muslims, official media reported. But Saudi Arabia stopped short of calling for any Arab action against the decision. Palestinian officials say Riyadh has been working for weeks behind the scenes to press them to support a nascent U.S. peace plan.  The reaction here was total surprise,  said Prince Turki, who now holds no government office but remains influential.   ... If there has been prior consultation or anything like that, why would the King go through the process of telling him (Trump) this is a bad idea and make that known publicly?    I don t think there ever was any discussion of this  before the decision was taken, he added. As regards possible Saudi and Arab action in response to Trump s decision, Prince Turki said:  I am sure lots of people would prefer to have something just for the sake of appearance but I don t think that s how the Saudi government operates. If it is going to take action, it is going to be a serious action.  Four Palestinian officials, who spoke on condition they not be named, said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas have discussed in detail a grand bargain that Trump and Jared Kushner, the president s son-in-law and adviser, are expected to unveil in the first half of 2018. Arab officials say the plan is still in its early phases of development.  Prince Turki said he was unaware of details of any such  plan. Prince Turki is a son of King Faisal, who was assassinated in 1975. His brother, Saud al-Faisal, served as foreign minister for 40 years until 2015, and their branch of the family is seen as influential over Saudi foreign policy, even as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has solidified his authority. Prince Saud championed a 2002 Arab peace initiative which called for normalizing relations between Arab countries and Israel in return for Israel s withdrawal from lands occupied in the 1967 Middle East war. In a letter to Trump published in a Saudi newspaper on Dec. 11, Prince Turki said that Trump s  opportunistic  Jerusalem move would threaten security in the region.  The now much diminished terrorist international gets a rejuvenation boost from you and re-energizes its recruitment of volunteers to broaden their murderous attacks on innocent civilians, worldwide,  he wrote in his letter. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has said he would encourage a more moderate and tolerant version of Islam in the ultra-conservative kingdom. The ambitious young prince has already taken some steps to loosen Saudi Arabia s ultra-strict social restrictions, scaling back the role of religious morality police, permitting public concerts and announcing plans to allow women to drive next year. Prince Turki said that Saudis share in the blame for the spread of extremist ideology through funding of mosques abroad that may have fallen into the wrong hands, but that such funding stopped since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.    The kingdom has been the victim of such people and such activity... Since Sept. 11 the kingdom has had a sustained and continuous program opposing extremist ideology, not just in the kingdom but abroad,  he told Reuters.     For a period of time, yes it is true there were some Saudis who promoted issues of extremism and so on. Now we are getting rid of all of those. I would say we have gotten rid of most of them, if not all of them.   ",1.0

 Watch Kellyanne Conway Accuse Democrats Of Interfering With Our Democracy By Opposing Trump (VIDEO),"At this point, it s hard to tell what the Trump administration will say next to attempt to deflect from anything at all involving The Donald and Russia.On Friday, White House spokesmoron Kellyanne Conway showed up on CNN to say that Democrats are just as bad as Trump s Russian allies who hacked and interfered with our election because they had the audacity to speak out against him. The president has said previously  that he would be concerned about anybody interfering with our democracy,  she said.  We saw a lot of people interfering with our democracy by saying he couldn t win here at home. Trump may be concerned with that form of  interference  because fascists are typically  concerned  with criticism, but he has shown absolutely zero problems with Vladimir Putin s propaganda and hacking efforts meant to install Trump in the Oval Office.Allisyn Camerota asked Conway what Trump plans to do to stop Russia from further interfering in our election, but she   well, she had nothing. Alisyn, I realize we just like to say the word  Russia, Russia  to mislead the voters,  Conway said.  And I know that CNN is aiding and abetting this nonsense as well, but you ve asked me this question three times now And you re not answering it, Kellyanne!  Camerota said.The reason Conway refuses to answer is that Trump and his minions are totally OK with that kind of interference. But criticism from an opposing political party?

U.S. student held in North Korea died of oxygen starved brain: coroner,"(Reuters) - An American student who had been imprisoned in North Korea for 17 months died from lack of oxygen and blood to the brain, an Ohio coroner said on Wednesday. Otto Warmbier s death on June 19 was due to an unknown injury that occurred more than a year before his death, Hamilton County Coroner Dr. Lakshmi Sammarco said at a news conference.   We don t know what happened to him and that s the bottom line,  Sammarco said.  Warmbier s parents could not be reached for comment on the coroner s report. The University of Virginia student was held by North Korea from January 2016 until his release on June 15. Warmbier, 22, was returned to the United States in a coma. The coroner and a Sept. 11 report by her office cited complications of chronic deficiency of oxygen and blood supply to the brain in Warmbier s death. Only an external examination of the body rather than a full autopsy was conducted at the request of Warmbier s family.  North Korea had blamed botulism and the ingestion of a sleeping pill for Otto Warmbier s problems and dismissed torture claims. Warmbier died days after arriving back in the United States.  The native of Wyoming, Ohio, had been arrested at the airport in Pyongyang as he prepared to leave the reclusive communist country. He had been traveling with a tour group. Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for trying to take from his hotel an item bearing a propaganda slogan, North Korea s state media reported. Saying his son had been tortured, Fred Warmbier told Fox News in an interview on Tuesday,  As we looked at him and tried to comfort him, it looked like someone had taken a pair of pliers and rearranged his bottom teeth.    Great interview on @foxandfriends with the parents of Otto Warmbier: 1994 - 2017. Otto was tortured beyond belief by North Korea,  President Donald Trump said on Twitter following the interview s broadcast.  In response to a question at the news conference, the coroner said there was no evidence of trauma to Warmbier s teeth nor was there evidence of broken bones. The coroner s report said that Warmbier s body had multiple scars varying in size, including a large irregular one measuring 4.3 by 1.6 inches on the right foot. ",1.0
 Texas Elector Resigns: Voting For Trump Would Bring Dishonor To God,"A Republican member of the Electoral College representing Texas, Art Sisneros, wrote on Saturday that he will resign and turn his position over to an alternate elector. Sisneros has previously been skeptical of throwing his support behind Donald Trump but now, he says he would rather resign than to vote against his conscience.In August, Sisneros thought of participating as a  faithless  elector, but in a largely unnoticed blog post over the weekend he wrote that he cannot bring himself to vote for Trump, so he decided to resign from his role as an elector, according to Politico. The Electoral College was corrupted from its original intent once states started dictating the votes of the Electors,  he writes. If Trump is not qualified and my role, both morally and historically, as an elected official is to vote my conscience, then I can not and will not vote for Donald Trump for President. I believe voting for Trump would bring dishonor to God,  Sisneros wrote.  The reality is Trump will be our President, no matter what my decision is. Sisneros said that he will  mourn the loss of our republic. Since I can t in good conscience vote for Donald Trump, and yet have sinfully made a pledge that I would, the best option I see at this time is to resign my position as an Elector,  Sisneros continued.  This will allow the remaining body of Electors to fill my vacancy when they convene on Dec 19 with someone that can vote for Trump. The people will get their vote   I will sleep well at night knowing I neither gave in to their demands nor caved to my convictions. I will also mourn the loss of our republic. This sounds similar to what Ted Cruz demanded people do. Vote your conscience. But the Texas Senator lost his spine, soul and conscience during the eleventh hour, then threw his support behind Trump. Ted Cruz is no Art Sisneros.____________________________________________________________________________________Image via Facebook.",0.0
" Trump Is FUMING Over Bad Charlottesville Press, Becomes A Terror In The White House (TWEET)","Once again, Donald Trump is having a completely disappointing, inappropriate reaction to the racially motivated violence that happened in Charlottesville, Virginia last weekend.Apparently, instead of being outraged about the murder of one counter protester and the injuries of several others, Trump is all bent out of shape because he has gotten a lot of negative press coverage for his weak, pathetic response to the incident. According to White House officials, Trump is coming apart at the seams over this, as Robert Costa reported: Person close to Kelly framed it to me this way: POTUS fuming at press, coverage of C ville handling. In no mood for talk about moderation. Seriously, what did Trump expect to happen after he ignored America s pleas to denounce the violence for two whole days, before issuing a scripted, half-ass statement on Monday? Not even the white supremacists Trump targeted in his response believed that he was actually denouncing racism.If Trump wanted positive press coverage, he should have actually done his job and condemned the white supremacist values and bigotry from the start. Speaking up against racism and the violence that broke out of that white nationalist rally was possibly the easiest task a President could ask for, and Trump failed miserably at executing that. Instead, Trump protected and defended the racist attackers, making his approval rating only plummet further and giving the media even more things to criticize.Trump can blame the media all he wants, but it is his own lack of competency that is responsible for his failure as president. He never does the right thing, even when it is blatantly obvious what actions he should be taking. What happened in Charlottesville was an opportunity for Trump to emerge as a different president than most Americans expect him to be, and he completely blew it. There is something very wrong when a leader cares more about his press coverage than the lives of his constituents.Featured image via Branden Camp  / Getty Images",0.0
"LIBERAL Lansing, MI Mayor Forced To REMOVE Sanctuary City Status After MI Residents Hammer Him For Arrogant Announcement On Tucker Carlson [VIDEO]","Watch his appearance on Tucker Carlson where he announced that Lansing, MI would be designated a  sanctuary city  here:The city council in Lansing, Mich. voted Wednesday to rescind its decision to deem itself a  sanctuary  city for illegal immigrants after concerns from the businesses that the status would draw unwelcome attention to the city.The term  sanctuary city  generally refers to jurisdictions that do not cooperate with U.S. immigration officials. Under Lansing city policy, police don t ask for people s immigration status, except as required by U.S. or Michigan law or a court order.Council members voted 5-2 to reverse last week s 6-0 vote to give the city  sanctuary  status. Immigration advocates in the crowd called called council members  spineless  and said  you re all losing your seats. The dispute comes as several cities are battling President Donald Trump s promised crackdown on places that block cooperation between their police departments and U.S. immigration authorities. The Trump administration has warned that sanctuary cities could lose federal money for refusing to cooperate with immigration authorities.After last week s vote, council members received a letter from the Lansing Regional Chamber and Michigan Chamber of Commerce urging them to remove references to  sanctuary city  from its resolution. Lansing is a diverse community, rich with history and culture. It s what makes our city a welcoming destination to live, work and thrive,  the business groups  letter says.  Recent actions of City Council, whether intended or not, have placed an unnecessary target on the City of Lansing while jeopardizing millions of dollars in federal funding that impacts the city budget. The term  sanctuary  in the resolution has become very problematic and distracting   so distracting in my opinion that s it s taken away from the intent of our resolution, which is to protect individuals,  said Councilwoman Judi Brown Clarke.  It s basically a  don t ask  policy, which was outlined by the mayor s executive order and what we had in our policy complements that. That was already the policy in Lansing before last week s vote, but Lansing called itself a  welcoming city,  rather than a  sanctuary city.  Neither the welcoming city resolution nor the sanctuary city resolution called for Lansing to prohibit workers from providing information on a person s immigration status with U.S. immigration officials   a ban that s at the heart of some urban sanctuary cities disagreements with the Trump administration.The issue also has touched off debate in the Republican-controlled Michigan Legislature, which is considering banning local governments from enacting or enforcing rules that limit communication and cooperation with federal officials concerning people s immigration status. Similar legislation died in the last session.   FOX News",0.0
Australian abuse report calls for end to sanctity of confession,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia should introduce a law forcing religious leaders to report child abuse, including Catholic priests told of abuse during confession, said a report on Friday which detailed institutional abuse, particularly in the Catholic Church. One the country s top catholics, Melbourne Archbishop Denis Hart, said such a law would undermine a central tenet of Catholicism, the confidentiality of the confessional, and warned that any priest breaking the seal of confession would be excommunicated. The 17-volume document from the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Abuse marks the end of one of the world s biggest inquiries into child abuse and leaves it to the government to decide whether to enact its recommendations. The five-year investigation found  multiple and persistent failings of institutions to keep children safe, the cultures of secrecy and cover-up, and the devastating affects child sexual abuse can have on an individual s life , the commission said in a statement. The report detailed tens of thousands of child victims, saying their abusers were  not a case of a few rotten apples .  We will never know the true number,  it read. In a statement, the Vatican said the report  deserves to be studied seriously  but made no mention of its specific suggestions.  The Holy See remains committed to being close to the Catholic Church in Australia   lay faithful, religious, and clergy alike   as they listen to and accompany victims and survivors in an effort to bring about healing and justice,  the statement said. The inquiry spanned religious, government, educational and professional organizations but heard many accounts alleging abuse cover-ups in the Australian Catholic Church, including allegations of moving priests suspected of abuse between parishes to avoid detection. Of survivors who reported abuse in religious institutions, more than 60 percent cited the Catholic Church, which demonstrated  catastrophic failures of leadership , particularly before the 1990s, the report said. The Vatican statement said Pope Francis had made clear that  the Church is called to be a place of compassion, especially for those who have suffered, and reaffirmed that the Church is committed to safe environments for the protection of all children and vulnerable adults.  The Royal Commission report said clergy told of child abuse in the confessional should be required by law to report it and called for the Catholic Church to make celibacy voluntary for clergy, adding that it contributed to child abuse.  I would feel terribly conflicted, and I would try even harder to get that person outside confessional, but I cannot break the seal,  Hart told reporters.  The penalty for any priest breaking the seal is excommunication, being cast out of the church, so it s a real, serious, spiritual matter, and I want to observe the law of the land ... but as part of my identity as a priest, I have to observe the seal of the confession.  A similar recommendation was made during Ireland s 2009 child abuse inquiry, leading to a mandatory reporting law in 2015. Some U.S. states have similar requirements. The Australian report also called for a National Office for Child Safety and national child safety standards, child abuse reporting and record keeping, which would cover all institutions engaged in child-related work. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the inquiry had  exposed a national tragedy  and that the government would consider the recommendations and respond in full next year. Sydney Archbishop Anthony Fisher, said in a statement that he was  appalled by the sinful and criminal activity of some clergy, religious and lay church-workers (and) ashamed of the failure to respond by some church leaders . The inquiry heard previously that the Australian Catholic Church had paid A$276 million ($212 million) in compensation to thousands of child abuse victims since 1980.

 Trump Justice Department Is Going After Anyone Who Even THOUGHT Of Protesting Trump,"While science doesn t quite have the technology to give Donald Trump the ability to read our minds, his justice department is doing the next worst thing. They are asking for IP addresses of every single person who visited a website that organized inaugural protests. There s a good chance they re after you and me.The website, which coordinated protests across the nation on Inauguration Day, is hosted by Dreamhost, and thankfully, they are fighting the warrant from Trump s justice department. The request from the [Justice Department] demands that DreamHost hand over 1.3 million visitor IP addresses   in addition to contact information, email content, and photos of thousands of people   in an effort to determine who simply visited the website,  DreamHost said in Monday s post [emphasis theirs].  That information could be used to identify any individuals who used this site to exercise and express political speech protected under the Constitution s First Amendment. That should be enough to set alarm bells off in anyone s mind. Source: BuzzfeedThat kind of data mining would have made Joseph McCarthy drool. It s clearly an attempt to gather evidence against Trump s opposition, even if that opposition is just regular citizens.It s not the first time they have tried going after protesters through internet history. 200 people were arrested during the January 20th protests and prosecutors have tried to go through Facebook to get information about those people Federal prosecutors have sought a range of electronic information related to the Jan. 20 arrests, including defendants  social media accounts. In a mostly sealed case that the Electronic Frontier Foundation and other digital rights groups believe is related to the Jan. 20 arrests, Facebook is fighting an order blocking the company from alerting users about search warrants for account information. That case is before the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, the city s highest local court.This is all a disgusting violation of privacy. Visiting a legal website is evidence of nothing, yet it s clear that Trump is gathering a list of people who disagree with him. What he will do with that list is still a mystery, but remember, it wouldn t surprise me if people on that list started seeing letters from the IRS or one of our law enforcement agencies.At the very least, this as an attempt to control dissent and perhaps make people afraid to organize online, which is by far the most effective way to organize. Just like his attempt to gather voter data from states is an attempt at making people afraid to register to vote.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images.",0.0
OOPS! Notable Black Harvard Economist Finds BLACKS Are LESS LIKELY To Be Shot By Cops Than Other Races: The most surprising result of my career,"Bad timing This is not great news for the Black Lives Matter terrorists, who were just getting warmed up. Not that the media or various Community Agitator groups will care about the truth Research conducted by a notable African-American economist at Harvard University has revealed a lack of racial bias in police shootings.The research was conducted by Roland G. Fryer, who is the youngest black professor to have received tenure status at Harvard. As Fryer expected, his research revealed that police are more likely to use force towards an African-American suspect. However, in what Fryer called  the most surprising result of my career,  his research also revealed that African-American suspects are less likely to be shot in an altercation with law enforcement than suspects of other racial backgrounds.According to the statistics used in Fryer s study, officers are more likely to fire their weapons without having first been attacked when the suspect is white.In officer-involved shootings in these cities, officers were more likely to fire their weapons without having first been attacked when the suspects were white. Black and white civilians involved in police shootings were equally likely to have been carrying a weapon. Both of these results undercut the idea that the police wield lethal force with racial bias.Fryer s research analyzed more than a thousand shootings in ten major police departments. Houston, Austin, Dallas and Los Angeles, as well as Orlando and Jacksonville, were among the cities included in the study.When the law enforcement data from Houston was isolated specifically, Fryer was able to conclude that law enforcement officers were significantly less likely to shoot black suspects.In tense situations, officers in Houston were about 20 percent less likely to shoot a suspect if the suspect was black. This estimate was not very precise, and firmer conclusions would require more data. But, in a variety of models that controlled for different factors and used different definitions of tense situations, Mr. Fryer found that blacks were either less likely to be shot or there was no difference between blacks and whites.The conclusions drawn by this research contradict much of the narrative that is playing out in the media about police brutality. Most major media outlets have been sympathetic to the cause of Black Lives Matter, an activist movement that exists specifically to combat racially motivated aggression towards African-Americans by law enforcement officers.

Trump says will quit Pacific trade deal on day one of presidency,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump released a video on Monday laying out actions he will take on his first day in office on Jan. 20, including withdrawing the United States from a Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Trump also said he would issue a rule cutting government regulations, direct the Labor Department to investigate abuses of visa programs, and cancel some restrictions on energy production, including shale oil and gas and coal.

Republicans offer bill to block potential Iran dollar use,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Republican U.S. senators who oppose the nuclear agreement with Iran introduced a bill on Wednesday that would keep Iran from gaining even indirect access to the U.S. financial system or using U.S. dollars in business transactions. The measure introduced by Senators Mark Kirk and Marco Rubio came amid media reports that U.S. officials were moving toward allowing such transactions. President Barack Obama has denied having such plans. The legislation would prohibit the president from issuing any license for conducting an offshore U.S. dollar clearing system for Iranian transactions or providing any such system with U.S. dollars. It also would impose secondary sanctions on any financial institution found to be participating in any offshore dollar clearing system with Iran. State Department spokesman Mark Toner acknowledged the United States was advising banks and other businesses about how to conduct business with Tehran without running afoul of U.S. authorities, but that does not involve converting money to dollars. These banks dont want to violate existing sanctions, he said, but they are allowed to under certain condition to do business with Iran, so we do consider it as an obligation on how to counsel them. Along with some of Obamas fellow Democrats, congressional Republicans unanimously opposed the deal announced in July in which Iran agreed to scale back its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Several lawmakers have been working on legislation since to keep tight controls on Iran, especially over its repeated ballistic missile tests since late last year. U.S. Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, published a column in the Washington Post on Wednesday saying Obama was so eager to preserve a signature foreign policy agreement that he would consider measures that would let Iran launder dollars while the administration looked the other way. The issue is particularly potent in this U.S. election year, when Americans will pick a new president, and every member of the House and one-third of senators are up for re-election. The three remaining Republican presidential candidates have all vowed to tear up or back away from the nuclear deal, which Obama administration officials say would be calamitous. Rubio suspended his 2016 presidential campaign last month, and Kirks Senate re-election race is seen as one of this years most competitive. ",1.0
BREAKING: [VIDEO] Controversial Mayor Who Refused To Allow Sharia Law In Texas City Where Muslim Clock Boy Went To School Explains Why School Cant Tell Their Side Of Story,"There s always another side that s usually being buried by the mainstream media in order to promote a leftist agenda Media coverage on Ahmed  Bomb-Clock  Mohamed has been remarkably one-sided, with the Mohamed family and the media spinning a tale of Islamophobia and overreaction.However, in an appearance on Glenn Beck s The Blaze TV last night, the mayor of the city where Mohamed goes to school painted a starkly different picture. Among other revelations were her claims that the Mohamed family had stonewalled her and seemed more interested in talking with the Council on American-Islamic Relations and related groups than with city officials.Irving, Texas, Mayor Beth Van Duyne said that, since Mohamed is a juvenile, they cannot release the records of what caused police to arrest him. She says that the family has refused to allow those records to be released, according to Townhall.com. The (Irving) school district, a number of times, has asked the family to release the records, so that you can have the balanced story out there,  Van Duyne said.  The family is ignoring the request from the ISD. The mayor said the records would  help to describe why it progressed as it did. Nobody is going to walk in and say,  Oh you re a 14-year old child, you re totally cooperating, we have all the answers we need, let s arrest you,  Van Duyne said, adding she had information that Mohamed was being  passive aggressive  and  non-responsive  when police questioned him.Van Duyne also noted that the family seemed more interested in seeking press than resolving the issue. We had tried to reach out to the family a number of times; this was before it ever even hit the papers on Wednesday,  Van Duyne said.  At the exact same time they were supposed to be meeting with us, they were on their front lawn with a press conference. Van Duyne also slammed President Barack Obama for jumping the gun on Ahmed Mohamed s case. We never even got a call from anybody at the White House asking to verify any of that information,  Van Duyne said.  I don t think the picture of the hoax bomb was even released before he tweeted  cool clock kid. Van Duyne, adding that Irving officials were receiving death threats because of the case, said that the  teacher was reacting to the device, not the student. If something had happened, and nobody had spoken up, people would be livid,  Van Duyne said.  Can you imagine if you were a parent at ISD and no one said anything? Via: Conservative Tribune",0.0

It s been great for the Democrats to have the black community s support and they don t want to lose those votes. That s why you constantly hear people in power trying to create racial strife It s been profitable for them in so many ways.

Trump acknowledges Russia role in U.S. election hacking: aide,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump accepts the U.S. intelligence communitys conclusion that Russia engaged in cyber attacks during the U.S. presidential election and may take action in response, his incoming chief of staff said on Sunday. Reince Priebus said Trump believed Russia was behind the intrusions into the Democratic Party organizations, although Priebus did not clarify whether the president-elect agreed that the hacks were directed by Russian President Vladimir Putin.  He accepts the fact that this particular case was entities in Russia, so thats not the issue, Priebus said on Fox News Sunday. It was the first acknowledgment from a senior member of the Republican president-elects team that Trump had accepted that Russia directed the hacking and subsequent disclosure of Democratic emails during the 2016 presidential election.  Trump had rebuffed allegations that Russia was behind the hacks or was trying to help him win, saying the intrusions could have been carried out by China or a 400-pound hacker on his bed. With less than two weeks until his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump has come under increasing pressure from fellow Republicans to accept intelligence community findings on Russian hacking and other attempts by Moscow to influence the Nov. 8 election. A crucial test of Republican support for Trump comes this week with the first confirmation hearings for his Cabinet picks.  A U.S. intelligence report last week said Putin directed a sophisticated influence campaign including cyber attacks to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and support Trump. The report, commissioned by Democratic President Barack Obama in December, concluded vote tallies were not affected by Russian interference, but did not assess whether it influenced the outcome of the vote in other ways. After receiving a briefing on Friday from leaders of the U.S. intelligence agencies, Trump did not refer specifically to Russias role in the presidential campaign. In a statement, he acknowledged that Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat(ic) National Committee. Trump spokesman Sean Spicer told Reuters the president-elects conclusions remained the same and that Priebus comments were in line with Fridays statement. Priebus wording did not appear to foreshadow the dramatic reversal of Trumps apparent Russia policy that experts say would be required to deter further cyber attacks. It will take a lot more than what we heard on television today to make Putin cool it, the expert added. In fact, there may not be anything that can deter Putin from pursuing a course hes bet his future and Russias on, said a U.S. intelligence expert on Russia, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss domestic political positions. The expert added that Putins multifaceted campaign of cyber attacks and espionage, propaganda, financial leverage, fake news and traditional espionage had expanded in the United States since the election, and it will be a shock if it does not escalate in France, Germany and elsewhere this year. Priebus, the former Republican National Committee chairman Trump tapped as White House chief of staff, said Trump planned to order the intelligence community to make recommendations as to what should be done. Action may be taken, he said, adding there was nothing wrong with trying to have a good relationship with Russia and other countries. Two senior Republican senators urged Trump to punish Russia in response to U.S. intelligence agencies conclusion that Putin personally directed efforts aimed at influencing the election. Appearing on NBCs Meet the Press, Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain said evidence was conclusive that Putin sought to influence the election - a point that Trump has refuted. In a couple weeks, Donald Trump will be the defender of the free world and democracy, Graham said. You should let everybody know in America, Republicans and Democrats, that youre going to make Russia pay a price for trying to interfere. On Saturday, Trump wrote on Twitter that having a better relationship with Russia was a good thing. U.S. Representative Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said three U.S. presidents had tried and failed to be friends with Putin. Im just not sure its possible, Nunes said on the Fox News Sunday program. Ive cautioned his administration to be careful with Putin, as he remains a bad actor. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell agreed it was not unusual for a new president to want to get along with the Russians. He added on CBS, however, that the Russians remained a big adversary, and they demonstrated it by trying to mess around in our election. Obama, who himself tried to reset relations with Russia after he took office in 2009, told NBC he did not think he had underestimated the Russian president. But I think that I underestimated the degree to which, in this new information age, it is possible for misinformation for cyber hacking and so forth to have an impact on our open societies, our open systems, to insinuate themselves into our democratic practices in ways that I think are accelerating, he said in an interview with Meet the Press broadcast on Sunday.

 Lifetime Texas Republican Leaves The GOP In Epic Resignation Letter,"Republicans continue to jump the sinking ship that chose Donald Trump to be their captain.Chris Ladd has been a Republican for 30 years now. He is so hardcore that he s even a friend of former Texas Governor Rick Perry and thought the world of Ronald Reagan.But now that the party has chosen Donald Trump as their 2016 nominee, Ladd wants nothing more to do with the GOP any longer, and he tore Republicans a new one in a letter he wrote announcing his resignation from the York Township Republican Committeemen s Organization and it is an epic read. At the national level, the delusions necessary to sustain our Cold War coalition were becoming dangerous long before Donald Trump arrived,  Ladd pointed out.  From tax policy to climate change, we have found ourselves less at odds with philosophical rivals than with the fundamentals of math, science and objective reality. And then Donald Trump came along and made the party even worse. From his fairy-tale wall to his schoolyard bullying and his flirtation with violent racists, Donald Trump offers America a singular narrative   a tale of cowards. Fearful people, convinced of our inadequacy, trembling before a world alight with imaginary threats, crave a demagogue. Neither party has ever elevated to this level a more toxic figure, one that calls forth the darkest elements of our national character.With three decades invested in the Republican Party, there is a powerful temptation to shrug and soldier on. Despite the bold rhetoric, we all know Trump will lose. Why throw away a great personal investment over one bad nominee? Trump is not merely a poor candidate, but an indictment of our character. Preserving a party is not a morally defensible goal if that party has lost its legitimacy. Ladd goes on to reminisce about Reagan s positive message and then sharply rebukes Republicans for abandoning their morality to pledge their allegiance to a fascist who has none. Fast-forward to our present leadership and the nature of our dilemma is clear. I watched Paul Ryan speak at Donald Trump s convention the way a young child watches his father march off to prison. Thousands of Republican figures that loathe Donald Trump, understand the danger he represents, and privately hope he loses, are publicly declaring their support for him. In Illinois our local and state GOP organizations, faced with a choice, have decided on complicity.Our leaders  compromise preserves their personal capital at our collective cost. Their refusal to dissent robs all Republicans of moral cover. Evasion and cowardice has prevailed over conscience. We are now, and shall indefinitely remain, the Party of Donald Trump.I will not contribute my name, my work, or my character to an utterly indefensible cause. No sensible adult demands moral purity from a political party, but conscience is meaningless without constraints. A party willing to lend its collective capital to Donald Trump has entered a compromise beyond any credible threshold of legitimacy. There is no redemption in being one of the  good Nazis. I hereby resign my position as a York Township Republican committeeman. My thirty-year tenure as a Republican is over. Ladd is absolutely right. The Republican Party has shattered any claim they had of being the morally superior party precisely because they are supporting a man who does not share their values. Furthermore, they are supporting a man who uses fear as a political tool and has a pessimistic view of America.This is not a sign of good news for the Republican Party or Donald Trump. Trump has seriously created a rift in the party between moderate Republicans and conservatives that could cost the GOP dearly on Election Day. The Republican Party needs more than just their base to win a general election and that means they need moderate voters like Ladd in order to have a chance at winning.If more people like Ladd continue to leave the Republican Party because of Donald Trump, the GOP is finished.Featured Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images",0.0
EPA head seeks to avoid settlements with green groups,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a directive to his agency on Monday seeking to end the practice of settling lawsuits with environmental groups behind closed doors, saying the groups have had too much influence on regulation. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who sued the agency he now runs more than a dozen times in his former job as attorney general of oil producing Oklahoma, has long railed against the so-called practice of sue and settle. The EPA under former President Barack Obama quietly settled lawsuits from environmental groups with little input from regulated entities, such as power plants, and state governments, he argues.  The directive seeks to make EPA more transparent about lawsuits by reaching out to states and industry that could be affected by settlements, forbidding the practice of entering into settlements that exceed the authority of courts, and excluding attorneys fees and litigation costs when settling with groups.  Most lawsuits by green groups on the agency seek to push the agency to speed up regulation on issues such as climate and air and water pollution, studies have shown.  The days of regulation through litigation are over, Pruitt said. We will no longer go behind closed doors and use consent decrees and settlement agreements to resolve lawsuits filed against the agency. Pruitts order was supported by conservative groups. Daren Bakst, a research fellow in agricultural policy at the Heritage Foundation think tank, said sue and settle has led to egregious antics that have effectively handed over the setting of agency priorities to environmental pressure groups, and has led to rushed rulemaking by the agency.   But Pat Parenteau, an environmental law professor at the Vermont Law School, said Pruitts directive would be counterproductive and costly because in the end courts could fine the agency if it does not meet compliance dates for issuing regulations. He can fight it if he wants as long as he wants, and spend as much money as he wants, Parenteau said. But in the end if youve missed a statutory deadline, you are going to be ordered (by a court) to comply and then you are going to be ordered to pay fees.  ",1.0

Trump says North Korea missile launch 'a situation that we will handle',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that the United States  will take care of  the North Korea issue after its latest missile launch, and that the basic U.S. approach to dealing with Pyongyang will not change. Trump has tightened sanctions on North Korea and pressured China to do more to help rein in Pyongyang s ballistic missile and nuclear ambitions. North Korea fired what the U.S. Pentagon said appeared to be an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that landed close to Japan on Wednesday. Trump said the missile launch did not change what he called the  very serious  U.S. approach, a week after he put North Korea back on a U.S. list of countries that Washington says support terrorism.  I will only tell you that we will take care of it... It is a situation that we will handle,  Trump told reporters during a meeting with Republican congressional leaders at the White House. U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis, who was also at the meeting, said the ICBM launch was a higher trajectory than any test conducted thus far by North Korea and called it part of a research and development effort.  It went higher frankly than any previous shots they have taken,  Mattis said. He said South Korea retaliated by firing some pinpoint missiles into the water to show North Korea that the U.S. ally would not be rattled by Pyongyang s launch. North Korea has said its weapons program is a necessary defense against U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such intention. ",1.0

FBI opens investigation into South Africa's Guptas: FT,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The FBI has opened an investigation into U.S. links to South Africa s Guptas, escalating a scandal over the family s alleged use of a friendship with President Jacob Zuma to control state businesses, the Financial Times said on Thursday. Separately, Britain s banking regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said it was in contact with two UK banks over any possible links to the Gupta family. The Guptas and Zuma have denied any wrongdoing. Gupta family spokesman Gary Naidoo could not be reached for comment and the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria had no immediate comment. The family, founders of a business empire spanning media, mining and consulting, have been named in a trove of leaked emails alleging graft in dealing with South Africa s state-owned companies, which also named several global firms. The Financial Times, which cited  people familiar with the matter , said U.S. investigators had been looking at individuals, bank accounts and companies in the U.S. for ties to alleged graft involving the family. It gave no further details. Britain s FCA said it was in contact with HSBC and Standard Chartered banks following reports in British newspapers that the finance minister had asked regulators to investigate the lenders  possible ties to the Gupta family and Zuma.  The FCA is already in contact with both banks named and will consider carefully further responses received,  the regulator said. Standard Chartered in London said they were not able to comment on details of client transactions but added that  after an internal investigation, accounts were closed by us by early 2014 . HSBC said it had no comment on the matter. Britain s parliament is expected to discuss British banks  possible involvement in the Gupta case on Thursday. Zweli Mkhize, one of several potential candidates to replace Zuma as head of the African National Congress in December, said the United States and Britain were within their rights to investigate.  If there is any information suggesting corruption or irregularities, it needs to be investigated across the borders. It should not be restricted to South Africa,  he told reporters. The Guptas and their companies have not been charged with any crime in South Africa, but the scandal is one of many that have dogged the Zuma presidency. Local media have reported extensively on the so-called  Gupta-leaks  - thousands of emails between the Guptas and their lieutenants and state-owned companies, politically connected individuals and private sector firms.

U.S. Homeland Secretary Kelly warns Guatemalans to stay home,"GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly on Wednesday told Guatemalans not to waste their money trying to get to the United States illegally, detailing how his department was cracking down on undocumented immigrants and would speed up deportations. Speaking after he greeted a plane full of Guatemalans deported back from the United States, Kelly said U.S. authorities were not carrying out mass deportations of immigrants and would follow the law.  But he stressed that deportees would be returned their home countries more quickly than in the past. If youre a Guatemalan who is considering paying a great deal of money to a coyote (smuggler) to bring you to the United States, youll be wasting your money, Kelly said at a Guatemalan Air Force base where 347 deportees earlier arrived on a flight.  You will be returned very quickly, he said. Kelly left Guatemala shortly after speaking to reporters, headed for Mexico where he and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson were expected to explain new U.S. immigration measures to their counterparts. U.S. immigration courts have a large backlog of cases, meaning it can take years to deport some undocumented immigrants.  In recent years, tens of thousands of Central American children and families have moved to the United States, many seeking asylum from ruthless street gangs. Kelly made his comments a day after his department said it planned to deport non-Mexican irregular immigrants to Mexico, regardless of their nationality. The plan angered Mexican officials, with their lead negotiator and Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray saying there was no way Mexico would accept it. ",1.0
 Trumps Latest Tweets Prove Hes Going To Be The WORST President Weve Ever Had (IMAGES),"Most of the people with brains in this country knew that Donald Trump, a reality television star, was not fit to be the next President of the United States and should not be allowed anywhere near the White House. Unfortunately, Trump was able to rile up enough hate and divisiveness in this country to get himself elected, but he s already proving that he s going to be a disastrous Commander-in-chief.No one has to look any further than Trump s Twitter account to understand how much of a mistake electing him was. Despite the fact that he promised he would be restrained on social media, Trump is incapable of changing. And instead of getting to work and laying out his vision for the country, he spent several hours on Sunday attacking The New York Times. Are you embarrassed for America? You should be.Here s how our thin-skinned President-elect went after a top newspaper:Twitter(It s worth mentioning that although Trump continues to deny that he ever said Japan should have nukes, he most certainly did say that.)But seriously, Presidents who actually do their job don t spend hours on Twitter attacking the free press. They don t have time, and they have more important things to focus on   things that go beyond what Trump is capable of handling.The New York Times didn t hesitate to call Trump out on his lies:TwitterWe re proud of our election coverage & we will continue to  hold power to account.  Here s what we told our employees & our subscribers: pic.twitter.com/dcaTrAS4mU  NYTCo Communications (@NYTimesComm) November 13, 2016It s safe to say that Trump didn t actually believe he was going to win the election, and he s miserable now that he has. His priorities have not changed one bit since becoming the President-elect. Trump has no real interest in actually running the country, and his Twitter account proves that he s going to fail and pull the rest of America down with him.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",0.0
 Trump Supporter Scott Baio Makes SHOCKINGLY Insensitive Comment About Former Co-Stars Death,"On Saturday, the internet was shocked to learn of the apparent sudden death of former Happy Days and Joanie Loves Chachi star, Erin Moran, who was only 56. The internet being the internet, people waited with bated breath to hear what the co-star and ex-boyfriend formerly known as Chachi and currently known as a right-wing nut job had to say about Moran. Scott Baio s response was exactly as assholish as you d expect it to be if you ve followed what he calls a career in recent years.His comment started out respectfully enough.My sincere condolences. #ErinMoran #HappyDaysFamily pic.twitter.com/5b0AbioZEc  Scott Baio (@ScottBaio) April 23, 2017Then things took a horrible turn when he was interviewed on The Bernie and Sid show on WABC. My thing is, I feel bad because her whole life, she was troubled, could never find what made her happy and content. For me, you do drugs or drink, you re gonna die,  he continued. I m sorry if that s cold, but God gave you a brain, gave you the will to live and thrive and you gotta take care of yourself,  Baio told the radio hosts.  I m saddened by what happened. I don t know if it was drugs that killed her, I read one report said it might have been and I hope it   I don t know what I hope. It s what it is. What can you do? She was just an insecure human being and fell into this world of drugs and alcohol. Again, I don t know if that s what killed her, I m sure it was a culmination of years and years of doing it that might have had something to do with it. She just never found her way,  he said, revealing that he had tried to get her help many years ago. How do you help somebody that doesn t want to help themselves?  he asked rhetorically.  You try a couple of times and if they don t want the help, I gotta go, sorry. Baio was right about one thing. He didn t know how Moran died. She had stage four cancer.Now, Baio is on the defensive, blaming the backlash on the fact that he supported Donald Trump (his Twitter photo is with Trump).I said  IF . @ChaseMit . My wife @MrsScottBaio spoke to Erin less than 1 month ago. You bash me ONLY because I support Pres @realDonaldTrump  Scott Baio (@ScottBaio) April 24, 2017Then, like his orange idol, Baio blamed the media for at first reporting on Moran s drug use.The media did first speculate that it was drug use, but that wasn t what was offensive about Baio s interview. What was offensive was his harsh judgment of, regardless of how she died, a sick woman. Baio, like most Republicans these days, believes that he is holier than thou and like Trump, when called out on it, lashes out and blames the  fake media. As for Moran, we can only hope she finds the peace she deserves and we wish her loved ones the best.Featured image via Getty/Alex Wong",0.0
Turkish army surveys Syria's Idlib before deployment - sources,"AMMAN/ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish army reconnaissance team scouted out Syria s Idlib province on Sunday, a senior Syrian rebel said, before an expected military operation to impose peace in the bitterly contested Syrian northwest.  When we don t go to Syria, Syria comes to us,  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told members of his ruling AK Party.  If we didn t take our measures, bombs would fall on our cities.  Turkey says it will provide assistance to rebels it has long backed, aiming to implement a de-escalation agreement designed to reduce fighting with pro-government forces in the area, the most populous pocket of Syria still in rebel hands. Although Turkish officials say they are helping the rebels from within Turkey, in past interventions they have also sent troops across the frontier. Any incursion could bring them into conflict with powerful jihadists from al Qaeda s former Syrian branch, although there were signs on Sunday that they were working to avoid a confrontation. Local sources said the Turkish military vehicles were escorted into Idlib by a convoy of fighters from the group, which has joined a jihadist alliance called Tahrir al-Sham and disavowed links to the network founded by Osama bin Laden. Nonetheless, the jihadists and the Turkish military earlier exchanged fire nearby, underscoring the tension as Turkey builds up its forces and the rebel groups it backs prepare to enter Idlib.   We will never allow a terror corridor that begins in Afrin and goes to the Mediterranean,  Erdogan said, referring to the stretch of Turkey s southern border which is controlled on the Syrian side by Kurdish fighters and Tahrir al-Sham. Turkey has been one of the biggest supporters of rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the six-and-a-half-year war, but its focus has moved from ousting him to securing its own border against jihadist and Kurdish groups.     Prime Minister Binali Yildirim stressed the importance of ensuring de-escalation near the border, following an agreement reached in Astana, Kazakhstan last month that was backed both by the Turks and by Russia, which supports Assad.  We will ensure safety in Idlib, and will cooperate with Russia,  Yildirim said. Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by the former Nusra Front, which was al Qaeda s Syrian branch until last year when it changed its name and broke allegiance to the global network, has been a formidable military force since early in the conflict. Since early this year it has battled other rebel groups as it tried to gain control over areas including Idlib.  Idlib and neighboring parts of northwest Syria are now home to more than 2 million people, many of them refugees from other formerly rebel-held regions that fell to pro-government forces.      A local resident and another local rebel said they had seen Turkish military vehicles enter Idlib and then travel under Tahrir al-Sham escort along a road.  The senior Syrian rebel said the reconnaissance team went to Sheikh Barakat, a location that overlooks both rebel-held areas of Aleppo province, adjacent to Idlib, and the Kurdish-controlled area of Afrin.  Erdogan gave no details of the operation, but said it was going ahead  without problems at the moment . Turkey s biggest security concern on the frontier is the Kurdish YPG militia, which as part of a U.S.-backed alliance is fighting against Islamic State in eastern Syria. Ankara regards the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought a three-decade insurgency inside Turkey. Mortars were fired from the area under YPG control near to the location where the Turkish reconnaissance team was operating, the senior rebel said.   The Turkish team is on its way back. Its mission has been accomplished. They visited areas of disengagement and locations where the Turkish army would be positioned,  the rebel said. Reuters witnesses, local people, and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said earlier on Sunday the Turkish military and Tahrir al-Sham had clashed near the village of Kafr Lusin in Idlib.  Tahrir al-Sham began the exchange by firing on a Turkish bulldozer removing sections of a border wall and Turkish artillery returned fire, they said. The area was later quiet.  Rebel groups that will take part - drawn from the Euphrates Shield campaign that Turkey backed with armor and troops in another part of Syria to the east since last year - said on Saturday they expected the Idlib operation to start very soon. Tahrir al-Sham said  the lions of jihad and martyrdom will be waiting to pounce  against any incursion into Idlib. The Syrian Civil Defence, better known as the White Helmets rescue workers, said on its Twitter account that jets it believed to be from the Syrian military had struck a marketplace in Maarat al-Numan in Idlib on Sunday, killing at least six.

 Sarah Palins #Brexit Response Is As Absolutely Crazy As You Knew It Would Be (IMAGE),"The world is reeling today as Britain just made the shocking decision to leave the European Union (EU). Yes, Americans and others around the world should care about this decision, as it affects us all. The world economy is already feeling the effects of it, and this vote could even have effects on the upcoming elections here in the States. Well, one person who really should keep her mouth shut on this and other world affairs has nevertheless weighed in: Sarah Palin.Palin showed her ignorance of foreign affairs during her infamously embarrassing run for the Vice President in 2008, so it should be no surprise that her response to Brexit is absolutely batshit insane. Palin posted to her Facebook (emphasis mine):When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another The UK knew   it was that time. And now is that time in the USA.The Brexit referendum is akin to our own Declaration of Independence. May that refreshed spirit of sovereignty spread over the pond to America s shores!Congratulations, smart Brits. Good on you for ignoring all the fear mongering from special interest globalists who tend to aim for that apocalyptic One World Government that dissolves a nation s self-determination and sovereignty  the EU being a One World Government mini-me.America can learn an encouraging lesson from this.It is time to dissolve political bands that connect us to agendas not in our best interest. May UN shackles be next on the chopping block.  Sarah PalinThe thing is, the people who voted in favor of Brexit didn t ignore the fear mongering. Quite the opposite in fact   they fell for it. They fell for squeals of nationalism, and taking their country back from the immigrants (one of the main parts of being a member of the EU is being able to travel freely across borders to other EU countries without Visas being required). You know, the same kind of right-wing fear mongering that we see here in America from conspiracy theorists warning that people like President Obama and Hillary Clinton are looking to build some kind of New World Order. Or something.This woman really needs to just be quiet. She s not a politician anymore, and she never should have been one in the first place. Go back under your bridge where you belong, Sarah, and let the grown-ups talk public policy. You re clearly not qualified to do so.Featured image via Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images",0.0

BRITAINS DAVID CAMERON Challenges Obama On Refusal To Admit ISLAMIC Extremist Violence Is Biggest Problem We Face,"Sorry David your tough talk comes a little too late. Britain will likely never return to her rich heritage and culture. Political correctness and bleeding heart liberals can assume the blame for allowing this tragedy to happen British Prime Minister David Cameron challenged President Obama with some blunt talk on Islamist extremism Tuesday during a gathering of world leaders at the United Nations to develop an international strategy for defeating the Islamic State and other terrorist groups.Well aware that Mr. Obama shuns the term  Islamist extremists,  the Conservative British prime minister reacted strongly at the meeting when the president, who chaired the session, advised the assembled foreign leaders to avoid profiling Muslims because  violent extremism is not unique to any one faith. Barack, you said it and you re right   every religion has its extremists,  Mr. Cameron said.  But we have to be frank that the biggest problem we have today is the Islamist extremist violence that has given birth to ISIL, to al-Shabab, to al-Nusra, al Qaeda and so many other groups.

" Conservatives Cant Believe Canadian PM Would Understand Science, Accuse Him Of Faking It","Canada s new liberal Prime Minister went viral after he deftly answered a question on the importance of quantum computing to a room full of reporters. For many, the ease with which he broke down the science was a testament to his intellect, his curiosity, and his interests in promoting science and technology. Unfortunately, for conservatives, any display of scientific literacy is immediately viewed as either elitism or fraud.Conservative writer J.J. McCullough went with the latter.In a piece on his blog breathlessly titled  The North Koreanification of Canadian political reporting,  he floated the idea that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s answer was a con job meant to make him look smart. Moreover, he accused the media of helping the prime minister stage  the quantum computing incident like propagandists out of North Korea.In the reporting that followed, the Canadian media deliberately and pointedly did not place Trudeau s verbal essay on quantum computing in the context in which it occurred. They instead chose to present the story in a fashion that would ensure maximum PR benefit to the prime minister   namely, this idea that Trudeau confidently called the bluff of a patronizing reporter.To put it another way, the Canadian media has actually reversed the realities of the story 180 degrees. What is being falsely presented as a story of a scrappy prime minister resisting a hostile press is actually a story of a slavishly subservient press who are actively shaping their reporting to suit the government s needs.This would all be completely eyeroll inducing if not for the fact that professional media contrarian sites like Gawker   usually so good at holding the spewers of nonsense accountable   instead quickly grabbed the narrative and ran with it. In writer J.K. Trotter s own breathlessly titled piece ( Justin Trudeau s Quantum Computing Explanation Was Likely Staged for Publicity ), he concurs that Trudeau s display of rudimentary understanding of quantum computing is impossible to explain if it weren t a vast media conspiracy.Somehow, we ve gotten to place where an interest in science and technology and a willingness to unabashedly share a love for it are considered negative character traits. We ve crossed an intellectual Rubicon and on the other shore aggressively ignorant anti-intellectuals like Ted Cruz are waiting for us with open arms. It s true that under a President Cruz, we would certainly never have to worry about having him explain quantum computing (or evolution, or climate change, or renewable energy), but is that supposed to be a good thing?It s worth noting that Trudeau s office vehemently denies the fact that the prime minister set up anything. The reporter who posed the original question to Trudeau also contacted Gawker to essentially tell them to screw off. If this is a conspiracy, it s an incredibly subtle one.But let s apply Occam s razor for a moment. Instead of a  North Koreanification  of the press, perhaps Trudeau s excitement in learning something new about a cutting-edge field of technology allowed him to understand and explain the science behind it. Perhaps he approached the researchers with legitimate questions and listened to their answers with legitimate interests. Perhaps what we saw during that interview was exactly what it looked like. Perhaps that s the kind of progressive values that led millions of Canadian citizens to vote for Justin Trudeau instead of his conservative counterpart in the first place.And perhaps we should applaud his effort, rather than demonize him just because other politicians have led us to believe science is scary and dangerous.Watch Trudeau explain quantum computing and confuse conservatives below:Featured image via YouTube screengrab",0.0
China accuses Australia of paranoia over foreign influence laws,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - China accused Australia of hysteria and paranoia on Wednesday  after Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull vowed to ban foreign political donations in a move to curb external influence on its domestic politics. Foreign powers were making  unprecedented and increasingly sophisticated attempts to influence the political process  in Australia and the world, Turnbull told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday. He had cited  disturbing reports about Chinese influence . The announcement came as concern grows that Beijing may be extending its soft power efforts in the country and as relationships between Australian politicians and Chinese government interests become increasingly contentious.  Some Australian media have repeatedly fabricated news stories about the so-called Chinese influence and infiltration in Australia,  the Chinese Embassy in Australia said in an English-language statement on its website.  Those reports, which were made up out of thin air and filled with cold war mentality and ideological bias, reflected a typical anti-China hysteria and paranoid (sic).   The statement said that  irresponsible remarks  by some Australian politicians and government officials had damaged trust between the countries and that it categorically rejected all allegations. China s soft power has come under renewed focus this week after a politician from Australia s opposition Labor party was demoted from government having been found to have warned a prominent Chinese business leader and Communist Party member that his phone was being tapped by intelligence authorities. In June, Fairfax Media and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported on a concerted campaign by China to  infiltrate  Australian politics to promote Chinese interests. Australia and neighboring New Zealand are among roughly a third of countries worldwide that allow foreign donations to political parties. Such donations are prohibited in the United States, Britain and several European countries. The new laws, modeled in part on the U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act, would criminalize foreign interference and require the registration of lobbyists working for nation states, Turnbull said.  China has no intention to interfere in Australia s internal affairs or exert influence on its political process through political donations,  the embassy said.  We urge the Australian side to look at China and China-Australia relations in an objective, fair and rational manner.  ",1.0
U.S. belatedly begins to comply with Russia sanctions law,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Thursday said it had belatedly begun informing Congress and others about groups associated with the Russian intelligence and defense sectors as required under a 2017 law tightening sanctions on Russia. The Countering Americas Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which became law on Aug. 2, among other things imposes sanctions on Russia to punish Moscow because U.S. intelligence agencies concluded Russia carried out a hacking and propaganda campaign to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied the allegations.  The law calls on the president to impose sanctions on anyone  he identifies as having engaged in a significant transaction with a person that is part of, or operates for or on behalf of, the defense or intelligence sectors of the Russian government. The law required the Trump administration to specify the persons that are part of, or operate for or on behalf of, the defense and intelligence sectors of the Russian government by Oct. 1, a deadline the administration missed. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has now authorized the State Department to identify such people or entities, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters. She said notification to Congress, as well as to industry, allies and partners, had begun and that public guidance on the matter would posted on the agencys website soon, although she suggested this would not happen on Thursday. We expect to post the full public guidance on state.gov shortly ... a lot of these conversations are still ongoing between Congress, industry, allies and also partners, Nauert said at a briefing. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker this week said he wanted administration answers about why it failed to meet the deadline for implementing the sanctions on Russia. However, he said he spoke to Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan by phone on Thursday and afterward said in a statement that the departments guidance is a good first step in responsibly implementing a very complex piece of legislation.

Turkey's parliament approves 2018 budget,"ISTANBUL(Reuters) - Turkey s parliament has approved the government s 2018 budget, which includes increased spending on defense and projects a rise in the fiscal deficit to 65.9 billion lira ($17.28 billion). The 2018 budget, approved by parliament late on Friday, introduces changes in tax regulations, such as tax increases for companies and motor vehicles, to help pay for increased security. In 2017, Turkey s budget is expected to show a deficit of 61.7 billion lira, more than twice the 2016 budget deficit of around 30 billion lira. Turkey s 2018 budget also projects tax income of 599.4 billion lira, up some 15 percent from estimates for 2017, and a 5.8 billion lira primary surplus. Over the past two years, Turkey s current account deficit has widened due to increasing government incentives to boost the economy and defense spending. Next year s budget deficit to gross domestic product ratio is expected to be 1.9 percent. The government says the additional defense spending is urgently needed to modernize the military, the second-largest in the NATO alliance, and meet the costs of domestic and foreign security operations. Turkey s economy has rebounded from a downturn that followed an attempted coup last year, helped by a series of government stimulus measures. GDP grew 11.1 percent year-on-year in the third quarter, its fastest expansion in six years, according to official data. ",1.0
 Baseball Players Who Called Obama F*cking Watermelon Eatin Baboon Wont Be Punished (IMAGES/VIDEO),"A group of Saint Louis University baseball players won t be punished after an insanely racist conversation they had amongst themselves became public. While it might seem that a group of students in a position to represent the school might face some form of discipline if they were to, say. call the President a  baboon,  reference multiple awful stereotypes about black people, and complain that a  colored  is running the country. Unfortunately, the school is continuing a proud American tradition almost as ancient as the sentiments these students were busted expressing: protecting sports teams from facing the music for their actions.Last May, the team traveled to Washington, D.C., where the conversation in a pitchers-only GroupMe chat swiftly went from  where do we eat  to  Donald Trump s Inner Thoughts. One player suggested the  KFC in the White House    you know, because all black people eat fried chicken (har har). Another helpfully added that  They got rivers of the grape kind there,  another reference to a popular African-American stereotype among stupid people. I heard they got a colored running the country,  someone else said.  This Tru?  Another player replied,  Unfortunately.. It is.  The asker responded,  F*cking watermelon eating baboon. and Luke Sommerfeld needed a MacBook charger.via DeadspinIt s unclear if Luke ever found his charger, but one thing is for certain   the pitchers on the Saint Louis University baseball team are a bunch of racist f*cks.One of the players texted a screenshot of the message to his roommate, former team manager Brendan Twomey, who held on to it for almost a year until his girlfriend saw it on her phone. Together, the two filed a complaint to the university. Deadspin gives a brief rundown of the events that transpired: The report was filed on April 4On April 5, Twomey and his girlfriend spoke to a university investigator.On April 11, after not having heard anything about the status of the investigation, Twomey and his girlfriend sent the image to the Black Student Alliance, who posted it to their Facebook page. Dr. Mona Hicks, SLU s Dean of Students, said there had been a miscommunication and a meeting to discuss the case was supposed to be held the next day.But, according to SLU s bias-related incident report log, the investigation had been closed on April 7 and labeled not applicable for discipline. When I received that screenshot, obviously I knew it was wrong, but I was in a tough situation because I didn t want to necessarily hurt anybody,  Twomey said as he explained his reasoning for holding onto the screenshot for so long. You become close [to the players] because you do spend so much time with them, so you overlook [that]. At the same time, I felt extremely disrespected. I knew there should be some sort of punishment, but I didn t know how to go about that,  he added.Asked about her decision to fail to punish her racist baseball players, Hicks was full of excuses. If I were to directly state to you,  You suck because of all of your social identities that God gave you.  That would be wrong. That would require some adjudication,  Hicks said in defense of giving her school s pitching rotation a pass on the horrible things they said.  We also need to respect laws. This was a private conversation, or at least the perception of private between in-group parties. Hicks did not explain what privacy laws were broken, though the answer to that is  none.  One of the players sent the screenshot to someone who showed it to someone else. No one hacked anyone, no one took someone s phone without permission. All of the information was given willingly. But, hey   she was trying to protect these students  right to privacy rather than avoiding a disruption of the season that might lead to the team failing to make it to the playoffs two years in a row (ultimately, they did not), right?Instead, the players  chose  to participate in a  facilitated dialogue  about what they did and the team s four captains wrote a letter to the school newspaper apologizing for that racist thing their teammates did: The leaders and captains of the team would like to extend an apology to anyone offended by the bias messages. We, too, are frustrated and feel that the comments do not accurately reflect the values that we hold. So far, the only person to face any real punishment is Twomey, who has been harassed since he blew the whistle on the players  racist conduct. The Riverfront Times reports:Two days later, Twomey says he awoke to discover his roommate had sloshed chewing tobacco spit on the floor outside his bedroom door, as well as the kitchen sink. Fingernail clippings had been prominently placed on the towel Twomey uses to clean his glasses.(In a Wednesday Facebook post from Pulphus, Twomey s roommate was identified as SLU pitcher Brett Shimanovsky   in fact, Shimanovsky appears to be the very same player/roommate who earlier provided Twomey with a screenshot of the racist chat thread. Twomey himself declined to answer questions about his roommate s identity, but says the roommate has since voluntarily moved out. Shimanovsky did not respond to a message seeking comment.) I consider this retaliation for filing a bias incident report,  Twomey says in a video documenting Shimanovsky s actions:Twomey says he is disappointed that the university has not in any way punished the players, whom he says should have been forced to miss a conference tournament (but that clearly was not an option in the eyes of the school, of course). He calls the captains   letter an  insult,  though he notes that the team s coach, Darin Hendrickson, did take the time to discuss the issue with him. He said he was aware there was a culture problem on the baseball team, a culture problem of entitlement, privilege and immaturity. He also said it was one of his biggest regrets that he hadn t recruited more diverse players,  Twomey recalled. He adds that there are  racial issues  that need to be confronted.It started a dialogue and frankly it needs to be continued,  the student says.

Nepal votes in final round of polls at the end of long democratic transition,"KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Nepalis began voting in the final round of parliamentary elections on Thursday, a key step to complete a near decade-long democratic transition after the abolition of the centuries-old monarchy and the end of a civil war against Maoist guerrillas. The first phase of the election was held on Nov. 26, with final results not expected for about another 10 days because of the cumbersome vote-counting procedure, officials said. Officials said more than 200,000 soldiers and police had been deployed to maintain security at polling centers after one person was killed and dozens wounded in a series of small blasts in the run-up to the polls.  Hundreds of activists, including from a splinter group of Maoists opposed to the election, have been detained for creating trouble,  army spokesman Nain Raj Dahal said. More than 15 million people were eligible to vote for the  275-member parliament - 165 through first-past-the-post and 110 on a proportional basis in both rounds. Voters will also choose representatives to seven state assemblies for the first time since Nepal became a federal democracy under the first republican constitution in 2015.  The country will achieve political stability after the election ... and will move ahead solidly on the path of economic and social prosperity,  President Bidhya Devi Bhandari said in a statement. Nepal has seen 10 government changes in as many years. Instability has given rise to corruption, retarded growth and slowed recovery from a 2015 earthquake that killed 9,000 people.  I voted in hopes for a stable government that can concentrate on development and create jobs so our children don t have to go abroad to work,  Binita Karki, 57, said after casting her ballots in a Kathmandu suburb, where armed soldiers stood nearby. Her son works on a construction site in Qatar. The election pits the centrist Nepali Congress party of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, who heads a loose alliance  that includes the Madhesi parties from Nepal s southern plains and former royalists, against a tight-knit alliance of former Maoists and the moderate Communist UML party. The Nepali Congress party is considered a pro-India group, while the opposition alliance is seen as closer to China. Nepal is a natural buffer between the two and the outcome could indicate whether China or India gets the upper hand in the battle for influence in a nation rich in hydropower and home to Mount Everest. Nepal emerged from a civil war in 2006 and abolished its 239-year-old Hindu monarchy two years later. ",1.0

Republican foreign policy veterans in quandary over Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some Republican foreign policy veterans who came out against Donald Trump during the presidential campaign said on Wednesday they were sticking to their guns following his election victory, but a few others signaled that objections to serving in his new administration were softening. Trumps stunning upset over Democrat Hillary Clinton has created a new dilemma for the Republican national security establishment, much of which had publicly distanced itself from their own partys candidate, declaring him unfit to lead. They must now decide whether to return to the fold. Some career diplomats, intelligence officials and military officers are also facing a choice of whether to quit their posts because of concern that a Trump presidency would violate their principles, or else stay and try to influence policy from the inside. However, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said, I wouldnt expect a mass exodus. About 150 of the Republican partys most prominent national security specialists signed open letters in March and August in outright opposition to Trumps candidacy. One said he was utterly unqualified for the White House. The other warned that he would be the most reckless president in American history. While neither letter said the former officials would never work for Trump, their scathing critique was clearly intended to discourage fellow Republicans from supporting him. Trump responded at the time by deriding them as members of the failed Washington elite who deserve the blame for making the world such a dangerous place. A number of the signatories contacted by Reuters on Wednesday made clear that they were unswayed from their negative view of Trump and would not work for him. However, they stopped short of urging others to also shun the next administration, which is widely seen as having limited foreign policy expertise at a time when the next president will face the challenges of Syrias civil war, the fight against Islamic State, a newly assertive Russia and the rise of China. I dont expect to be asked. I wouldnt serve. But there are others who will. It will be a matter of individual conscience, said Eliot Cohen, who served as counselor to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and helped spearhead the March letter, which was posted on a blog called War on the Rocks and created a stir among Republicans. Im concerned about his ignorance, the belligerence, the misunderstanding of how the world works, Cohen said of Trump, a wealthy real estate developer and former reality TV host who rode to victory on a wave of voter anger toward Washington insiders. Max Boot, a foreign policy adviser to Republican Mitt Romneys 2012 presidential campaign and a supporter of the U.S.-led Iraq invasion in 2003, said: I wont have anything to do with Trump, but I dont know about others. I hope good people go into the government. But others appeared to waver, with some saying decisions on whether to join the Trump administration could depend on how the president-elect behaves during the transition and who he appoints to senior posts. Among the Trump allies said to be in consideration are former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich and one-time United Nations ambassador John Bolton for secretary of state, and General Michael Flynn, a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, for national security adviser. Dov Zakheim, a former Pentagon undersecretary who signed one of the dissent letters, said Trump would have to reach out beyond his circle of supporters to find enough qualified people to fill many important jobs. He will want to show that he is not dividing the Republican party, so he will extend an olive branch to those in the party who opposed him, Zakheim said. Asked whether he expected to be offered a post, he said: I have no idea, as its not up to me. Bryan McGrath, a retired US Navy officer and co-organizer of the War on the Rocks letter, said he did not expect that those who signed it were signing away employment rights, that they werent going to work in a Trump administration. If the president asks for your service, he said, you have to take that request seriously. Patrick Cronin, an Asia expert and former third-ranking official at USAID under President George W. Bush, said that despite his earlier opposition to Trump, he eventually briefed his transition team and would continue to provide advice. But he said he was not interested in joining the administration. Michael McFaul, President Barack Obamas former ambassador to Moscow and a Clinton supporter in the election,  said the Republicans had a deep bench of experience for enlisting foreign policy experts. Even as Trump prepares to form his foreign policy team, some career diplomats, intelligence officials and military officers are facing a post-election quandary. Some said privately before Tuesdays vote they would consider retiring or quitting rather than working under Trump, who alarmed them during the campaign by questioning U.S.-led alliances, praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggesting that Japan and South Korea should be allowed to have nuclear weapons and threatening to order the resumption of interrogation methods condemned as torture. Other officials suggested they would wait to see how he acts once in office and who henames to senior posts, saying the responsibility for government service transcended any one president. If he keeps some of his campaign promises, about the use of torture, for example, many of us have discussed whether we are honor-bound to resign or to stay and try to have some influence from the inside. Its too early to say, one CIA officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ",1.0
"[VIDEO] IN ONE OF THE DARKEST CORNERS OF THE WORLD, An Iraqi Archbishop Makes A Beautiful Music Video To Give Christian Refugees Hope","Refugee camps are overflowing with Christians and Yazidis who ve been persecuted and chased from their homes by ISIS. This beautiful video reminds the residents of these refugee camps to keep the faith and not to lose hope in God and their faith community A British electronica band has teamed up with the archbishop of Iraq to release a song sending a message of hope to persecuted Christians, Yazidis, and other minorities in the crosshairs of the Islamic State and raising awareness about their suffering and need for support.Ooberfuse, a duo based in Woolwich, London, recently released the video, titled  We Are One.  The video was shot in various refugee camps in Erbil and features children of all backgrounds who are living in squalor after the Islamic State forced them to flee their homelands. They are the fortunate who managed to survive the assault.As The Christian Post reports, the video  features very strong Christian overtones and reiterates the fact that although many of these refugees have lost their homes and lives they once knew in Iraq, they will never be without the love and hope of God.  It also features quotes from a number of officials explaining the suffering of not being able to return home.Archbishop Bashar Warda of Erbil begins the video by reciting the Lord s Prayer in Aramaic, the language in which Jesus is believed to have first recited it. Archbishop Warda expressed enthusiasm for the project in speaking with the Catholic Herald.  Sometimes you take hard measures, unfortunate measures to deal with and treat this cancer,  he added, referring to the Islamic State as the  cancer. Archbishop Warda has previously used the term for the terrorist group, though noting in remarks in April that sectarian violence based on religion is  not new,  though the Islamic State has taken it to a new scale of horror. He has called for Christians to try to remain in their native lands in Iraq and preserve the religion there, as he has seen the numbers of his diocese diminish rapidly.  We know that life in Iraq is not easy, especially when they live crammed into a room in a house or in a caravan and we have been left with nothing,  he stated, but hoped some would reconsider. I think this is the first time in history a leading Middle Eastern religious leader has embraced the forms of popular culture to advance the Christian message of love and hope,  said Ooberfuse singer and guitarist Hal St John, thanking the archbishop for joining their efforts.Via: Breitbart News",0.0

"Clinton Foundation to bar foreign, corporate funding if Hillary Clinton elected president","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Clinton Foundation will stop accepting foreign and corporate donations if Hillary Clinton is elected president and will stop holding the annual Clinton Global Initiative meetings whatever the outcome of the November election, a foundation spokesman said on Thursday. Former President Bill Clinton told staff members on Thursday he would resign from the foundations board and that it would only accept donations from U.S. citizens and independent charities. The former president also said he would hold the 12th and final Clinton Global Initiative in September. The annual meetings have included current and former heads of state, corporate leaders and celebrities who discussed poverty, healthcare, development and other issues.     Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian confirmed the moves, which were first reported by the Associated Press. The foundation has come under fire during Hillary Clintons Democratic presidential campaign, with Republicans charging that donors were rewarded with access to her and her aides as well as her husband while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.  Other critics have said the foundations reliance on millions of dollars from foreign governments created conflicts of interest for a would-be U.S. president. Clinton resigned from the foundations board after launching her successful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. She will face Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election.  The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, founded in 2001, has raised more than $2 billion for causes that focus on health and environmental issues, mainly in the developing world.  ",1.0
Trump barnstorms to push healthcare plan; signs of conservative support,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump used his barnstorming strategy on Wednesday to try to build momentum for his first legislative initiative, a healthcare overhaul, by holding a massive rally in Nashville, Tennessee, reminiscent of his campaign events. Back on Capitol Hill, Republican leaders negotiated behind closed doors, held media conferences and gave cable-news interviews as they tried to push forward their plan to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare. After Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan unveiled the new plan last week, fault lines appeared within the party as some conservatives said it did not go far enough and others rejected it entirely.  Trump used campaign-like language in his Wednesday night speech, pledging to repeal and replace horrible, disastrous Obamacare. Speaking to reporters aboard presidential plane Air Force One after the rally, Trump expressed optimism about his plans chances in Congress.  Were going to come up with something. We always do, he said. Republicans control both Congress and the White House for the first time in a decade, but the overhaul still faces political battles to be fought by a president new to governing. White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters before the rally the Trump administration had been in talks with Ryan and congressional leaders and was flooding the media with interviews with administration officials to help advance the plan. Ryan, the top Republican in the House of Representatives, also continued to champion the legislation, saying on cable news he was open to making improvements and refinements, but also adding the major components are staying intact. He told a news conference later in the evening the House would hold votes on repealing and replacing Obamacare but refused to provide a timetable. Two House committees approved the bills provisions with no changes last week. The Budget Committee will try on Thursday to unify the plan into a single bill for consideration on the House floor. Republicans cannot afford to lose more than three from their ranks on the committee for it to pass. Three committee Republicans are members of the hardline conservative House Freedom Caucus. Signs emerged on Wednesday that the White House was winning over reluctant conservatives who initially questioned the legislation on the grounds that it too closely resembled Obamacare, the signature domestic policy achievement of former President Barack Obama. The administration indicated it was open to revisiting the plans treatment of Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor, during a meeting with a conservative wing of the party. Specifically, conservatives want Obamacares expansion of Medicaid to end sooner than proposed in the Ryan plan, and want to introduce Medicaid work requirements for able-bodied adults without children. State governments run Medicaid with reimbursements from the federal government. Obamacare expanded its eligibility and increased funding for it, which enabled about 10 million previously uninsured Americans to obtain medical insurance.  Vice President Mike Pence advocated for the plan earlier on Wednesday behind closed doors with the Republican Study Committee, a large group of House conservatives. Republican Representative Phil Roe said after the Pence meeting the bill would probably be changed to move up the end of the Medicaid expansion by one year, to 2019. The conservative groups members were very close to signing off on the legislation, its leader, Representative Mark Walker, told reporters. Speaking on CNN, Ryan mentioned giving states better chances at more flexibility with Medicaid, but provided no details. Just as the partys conservatives began expressing optimism about the proposals fortunes, Republican moderates raised concerns that tax credits currently in the bill intended to help people buy health insurance were not sufficient. Representative Charlie Dent, following a meeting of moderate Republicans with Pence, told reporters that speeding up the termination of the Medicaid expansion was a non-starter. Senate Republicans have also voiced rising unease. As written, the House bill would not pass the Senate. But I believe we can fix it, Senator Ted Cruz told reporters. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told NBCs Today show: It is mortally wounded. The conservative advocacy group FreedomWorks held a rally amid snow flurries and a frigid wind outside the Capitol, where several House and Senate Republicans, including Cruz and Senator Rand Paul, voiced dissatisfaction with the bill. Paul later told reporters: The White House has been much more open to negotiation on this than House leaders.  A libertarian, Paul posted an op-ed on the Breitbart News website later on Wednesday calling Ryans plan Obamacare Lite and suggesting smashing it to smithereens. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released data showing enrollment in the individual insurance plans created under Obamacare has declined to 12.2 million Americans. Enrollment in these individual insurance plans was down by about 500,000 people from 2016 by the end of January, it said. It is about 1.6 million people short of Obamas goal for 2017 sign-ups, the government said. ",1.0
CAUGHT ON TAPE: RNC Committeeman Urges Republicans To Rally Against Trump [Video],"Is the Republican establishment is in panic mode over Trump s staying power in nationwide GOP polls? Instead of sitting around gnashing their teeth, perhaps they should let the voters decide you know,try something new and actually listen to the American people  Your thoughts?A Republican National committeeman delivered a call-to-arms against Donald Trump during a closed-door GOP meeting on Thursday, urging his colleagues to take a forceful stand against those who he said are destroying the party s brand.At a breakfast at the RNC winter meeting, Holland Redfield, an RNC committeeman who represents the minority-rich Virgin Islands, rose to address party Chairman Reince Priebus. In the five-minute impromptu speech, a video recording of which Redfield provided to POLITICO, Redfield did not explicitly mention Trump s name. But he made clear that angry voices in the party pose a grave threat to the GOP s future, and expressed alarm at what he described as crushing pressure to play nice. You can argue with me, but we re almost terrorized as members of our party.  Shut up. Toe the line, embrace each other, and let s go forward.  I understand that. But there is a limit to loyalty. I am loyal to this party by speaking out on these very issues,  he said at the private breakfast meeting.At one point, Redfield essentially argued that those in the room have been held hostage by Trump s threat to run as a third-party candidate if the party hierarchy treats him unfairly.

 WATCH: Colbert HILARIOUSLY Portrays Trump As A Little Girl And The Internet Is Laughing Out Loud,"Donald Trump is totally going to lose his sh*t when he sees this.As we all know, Trump is insecure about the size of his hands and he has a major problem with women mocking him.So when Melissa McCarthy played Sean Spicer on Saturday Night Live last week it not only lite the Internet on fire, the skit enraged Trump because Spicer was played by a woman, which Trump believes makes Spicer look weak. You know, because Trump doesn t consider women strong, independent, and equal to men.Well, Late Show host Stephen Colbert took Trump s gripe and ran with it on Friday night. Evidently, he was not laughing because apparently, Trump thought a woman playing a man  makes Spicer look weak,  Colbert began.  First of all, I have met Melissa McCarthy and she could kick the ass of every man in that administration. And then Colbert unveiled the greatest trolling of Trump seen yet. If the president thinks a woman portraying Sean Spicer makes him look weak, then he s really not going to like this picture we made of a little girl pretending to be Donald Trump.

"SANCTIMONIOUS, OPEN-BORDERS PAUL RYAN Is Tanking In PollsWill FED UP Voters Avenge Non-Trump Supporters In November?","Will Republican voters take down sanctimonious RINO s like Speaker Ryan when they hit the voting booths for Trump in 2016? Paul Ryan s reluctance to get behind Trump and support his bid for President may actually hurt his chances of re-election in November. Ryan s arrogance and lack of interest in supporting the very popular Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump may cause him to lose a large number of voters who were previously behind him. A poll of likely Republican voters shows House Speaker Paul Ryan well below 50 percent in his race to maintain his seat in Wisconsin s first Congressional district. The poll was conducted by P.M.I., with 424 respondents randomly called from a file of 11,000 likely GOP primary voters. It shows that with one month remaining before Wisconsin s August 9th vote, Ryan is polling at 43 percent.Ryan s challenger, Wisconsin businessman Paul Nehlen, is polling at 32 percent.The Nehlen campaign notes that Ryan s 43 percent  represents a drop of more than 30 points since the Nehlen campaign began polling likely Republican primary voters earlier in the year. This poll shows voters are considering their options and choosing to opt out of Paul Ryan s job-killing policies,  Nehlen said.The new poll could be viewed as a warning sign to Ryan, as Wisconsin voters may be growing increasingly frustrated with the key elements of Ryan s longstanding policy agenda.Nehlen told Breitbart that the reason Ryan has tanked below 50 percent in the latest poll is a direct result of his policies on trade, immigration, and national sovereignty. Paul Ryan is the most open borders, pro-Wall Street, anti-worker member of Congress in either party,  Paul Nehlen said during a Saturday press conference, which was held in front of Ryan s border wall surrounding his Janesville mansion.  Everything that Americans despise about their government, Paul Ryan represents  Can you name one time when Paul Ryan fought as hard for you and your family as he s fought for corporate America?  Nehlen asked.In recent weeks, Nehlen has launched an aggressive billboard campaign that has thrown a spotlight on Ryan s longstanding support for open borders immigration policies that would flood the labor market, as well as trade policies that ship American jobs overseas.On immigration, Ryan has a two-decade long history of pushing open borders policies. Dating back to his time as a Congressional staffer in the mid-90s, Ryan worked to derail the bipartisan immigration curbs inspired by Civil Rights leader and late-Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Jordan.In 2013, Ryan worked hand in hand with Luis Gutierrez to push Marco Rubio s border-opening immigration agenda.For years, Ryan has been vocal about his desire to enact open borders. Every month the U.S. imports a population of immigrants that is larger than the occupancy of Lambeau Field. Yet Ryan has repeatedly pushed policies that would make that number even larger despite the fact that 92% of the GOP electorate, and 83% of the American electorate in general, want to see immigration levels frozen or reduced.Just last year, Ryan s omnibus spending bill funded a controversial expansion of the refugee resettlement program funding visas for nearly 300,000 (temporary and permanent) Muslim migrants within the course of a single year.Despite the fact that seven in ten GOP Wisconsin voters support Donald Trump s proposal to enact a temporary pause on Muslim migration, Ryan has ruled out curbing Muslim migration into the United States insisting  that s not who we are. Every year the U.S. issues visas to a population of temporary and permanent Muslim migrants that is larger in size than the number of Paul Ryan voters in Wisconsin s first Congressional district.On trade, Ryan has been one of Congress  leading advocates for globalist policies that have impacted American jobs.Since Ryan took office in 1999, Wisconsin has lost one-fifth of its total manufacturing jobs.Yet in 2015, Ryan acted as President Obama s  partner  in his effort to fast track the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). In a 2015 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Ryan described the TPP as a  historic  agreement, which  would mean greater access to a billion customers for American manufacturers, farmers, and ranchers. Wisconsin suffered a net loss of nearly 40,000 jobs in 2015 alone due to the U.S. trade deficit with TPP countries, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Wisconsin exit polls showed that a majority of Wisconsin GOP voters (54%) believe that foreign trade kills jobs.Moreover, in recent months, Ryan has taken a series of actions that seem designed to undermine his own party s 2016 presidential aspirations and further the candidacy Hillary Clinton.Ryan dragged out his decision to endorse Donald Trump for weeks leaving voters with the distinct impression that Ryan does not consider the choice between Trump versus Clinton to be an easy one.Although Ryan has now technically endorsed Trump, he continues to be one of Trump s most frequent public critics. In interviews about the election, Ryan seems much more aggressive in attacking Trump than he has been in going after Hillary Clinton.In this sense, some argue that Ryan has perhaps done more damage to Trump with his endorsement than he could have done by not endorsing him much the same way that Rick Santorum helped tank Marco Rubio by giving one of the worst endorsement interviews in history, in which he could not name a single accomplishment of Sen. Rubio.Nehlen s spokesman said that in light of the growing momentum in the district, the campaign is planning to substantially increase its expenditures. Nehlen s spokesman, Eric Odom, said:The Nehlen camp is running a full campaign operation with more than 1,000 doors being knocked each day, targeted mail dropping into homes, billboards up all over the district, aggressive sign marketing, TV and radio ads blanketing the district and mobile marketing reaching voters in ways that are making a significant impact. This effort is presenting profound influence in the district and voters are liking what they see. This poll, and the momentum that comes with it, has us ready to increase expenditures and step up our fight in a big way.For entire story: Breitbart",0.0
 Uncovered Video: Trump Makes CREEPIEST Comments Yet About His Daughter (VIDEO),"It s clear that Donald Trump thinks his daughter is beautiful. There s nothing wrong with that. All fathers are supposed to believe that, but Trump s fatherly admiration of Ivanka goes far beyond just thinking she s beautiful   he finds her sexually attractive and that s creepy as hell. The latest video to come out adds a new dimension to Trump s attraction to his own daughter.There is certainly history. Trump loves to have Ivanka sit on his lap, to the point of her appearing to give him a lap dance.Image courtesy of Snopes.The GOP presidential candidate (the best they apparently could come up with) has joked numerous times about dating, or even marrying, his daughter.Still, in none of these instances did Trump specifically mention sex. This newly uncovered video, from just three years ago, does. In an appearance on the Wendy Williams show, Trump and Ivanka were asked what they had in common. Ivanka answered as you might imagine the daughter of a rich person. She said that golf and real estate are their two main common interests. Her father, though, said something entirely different,  well, I was going to say sex, but I can t relate that to her. Oh, thank goodness he stopped himself from saying  sex,  right after he said  sex. Check out the look on her face:Here s the screen grab of the very brief (if you blink, you d miss it) but telling moment:Maybe this is just an innocent joke of some kind, but even if it is, it s very telling. Donald Trump seems to see women through just one prism, and that s whether or not he s sexually attracted to them. It s also highly likely that when Ivanka was a child, her father had almost nothing to do with her, so that could have something to do with the apparent fact that he doesn t have normal fatherly feelings toward his daughter. Instead, like all women, Trump sees her as a sex object.Featured image via video screen shot",0.0
Britain's Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to marry on May 19,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s Prince Harry and his American fianc e, Meghan Markle, will marry on Saturday May 19, his office Kensington Palace said on Friday. Queen Elizabeth s grandson, fifth-in-line to the throne, and Markle, who stars in the U.S. TV legal drama  Suits , announced their engagement last month with the marriage to take place in St George s Chapel at Windsor Castle.  His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales and Ms. Meghan Markle will marry on 19th May 2018,  Kensington Palace said in a statement.  The couple said they had chosen to marry in Windsor, west of London, because it was  a special place for them , having spent time there regularly since they met in July 2016 after being introduced through a mutual friend.  Harry s 91-year-old grandmother, Elizabeth, will attend the ceremony. However, the date they have chosen clashes with English soccer s FA Cup Final which is usually attended by Harry s elder brother Prince William who, as President of the Football Association, awards the trophy to the winners.  The couple of course want the day to be a special, celebratory moment for their friends and family,  Harry s Communications Secretary Jason Knauf said last month.  They also want the day to be shaped so as to allow members of the public to feel part of the celebrations too and are currently working through ideas for how this might be achieved.  The wedding is likely to attract huge attention across the world, as did the marriage of William to his wife Kate in 2011 which was watched by an estimated two billion people. The royal family have said they will pay for the core aspects of the wedding, such as the church service and reception. Markle, 36, who attended a Catholic school as a child but identifies as a Protestant, will be baptized and confirmed into the Church of England before the wedding. She intends to become a British citizen, though she will retain her U.S. citizenship while she goes through the process. The Gothic St George s Chapel is located in the grounds of Windsor Castle, which has been the family home of British kings and queens for almost 1,000 years. Within the chapel are the tombs of ten sovereigns, including Henry VIII and his third wife Jane Seymour, and Charles I. On Wednesday, Kensington Palace announced Markle would join the queen and other senior Windsors for their family Christmas celebrations at her Sandringham estate in eastern England in what commentators said was a break with royal protocol under which such an invitation would normally only be extended to Markle after the wedding.

Most South Koreans doubt the North will start a war: poll,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has ratcheted up international tension and fear with its sixth and largest nuclear test on Sunday, but South Koreans feel increasingly doubtful it would start a war, a poll showed on Friday. A Gallup Korea survey found that 58 percent of South Koreans felt there was no possibility North Korea will cause a war, while 37 percent said they thought it would. Gallup Korea began asking South Koreans the question in 1992, and the percentage of respondents this time who thought the North would not start a war was the second highest since then. In the first poll in 1992, 69 percent of those questioned thought the North would start a war while only 24 percent thought it would not. The survey released on Friday showed South Koreans were considerably less concerned about war compared with June 2007, nine months after North Korea conducted its first nuclear test, in September 2006. In 2007, 51 percent of respondents said they expected a war, while 45 percent did not. North Korea says it needs to develop weapons to protect itself against U.S. aggression. It has been steadily pursuing its nuclear and missile programs in defiance of international condemnation and has threatened more action in response to any new U.N. sanctions and U.S. pressure. Despite the North s fiery rhetoric, South Koreans are generally calm, going about their lives with no sign of panic.  The survey results show South Koreans have likely grown accustomed to its repeated threats of provocation after over 60 years in a ceasefire state,  Gallup Korea said in a statement. South Korea and the United States are technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. The poll also found that 60 percent of those surveyed believed South Korea should arm itself with nuclear weapons while 35 percent disagreed.  Those in their twenties were most opposed to the idea of acquiring nuclear weapons, while respondents 50 and above said the South should have them. Gallup also said 59 percent of respondents were against the idea of the United States attacking North Korea first should North Korean provocations continue, while 33 percent said it should. Gallup Korea said the poll was carried out from Sept. 5 to 7. A total of 1,004 South Koreans over the age of 19 were polled by telephone, it said.

Bill letting people bring concealed guns across state lines passes U.S. House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - People would be able to bring legal, concealed guns into any U.S. state under legislation the House of Representatives approved on Wednesday that would also bolster the national background check system and require a study of the bump stocks used in Octobers Las Vegas mass shooting. The countrys long-standing fight over gun ownership has grown more heated since a single person killed 58 people and injured more than 500 at a music festival in Las Vegas, Nevada, the deadliest mass shooting carried out by an individual in U.S. history. Stephen Paddock boosted his firearms with bump stocks to shoot thousands of bullets over 10 minutes. On a vote of 231 to 198, the Republican-led House approved the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which would require states to recognize each others permits for carrying hidden and loaded firearms while in public. States requirements on concealed guns vary widely. Some states deny permits to people who have committed domestic violence or other crimes. Eight do not require permits at all.  Supporters of the bill, which still must be approved by the Senate, say states recognize each others drivers licenses and other permits, making concealed-carry permits the exception.  Detractors say the bill tramples states rights and that gun permits differ from drivers licenses, which are generally uniform across the country. They also say that, under the legislation, gun owners will only have to abide by requirements of the most lenient states. The bill passed eight days before the fifth anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting in which 20 children and six adults perished. So far this year, 14,412 people have died and 29,277 have been injured in firearm-related incidents in the United States, according to the Gun Violence Archive. About 8 percent of them were children and teenagers. Bill supporters also pointed to last months Texas shooting, where a man fired his rifle on a fleeing gunman who had just killed 26 worshippers at a church. The gunman was later found dead in his car. We know that citizens who carry a concealed firearm are not only better prepared to act in their ownself-defense, but also in the defense of others, said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican. The legislation also included a bipartisan measure to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Meanwhile, the Justice Department has already begun studying bump stocks, and could soon ban them. ",1.0
GOTCHA! A Stammering John Podesta Stunned by a REAL Question from CBS Reporter,"John Podesta is Hillary Clinton s former campaign chairman so you know he s a dirty bird. That s why this is such a fun video to watch. Podesta had a brutal exchange on CBS s  Face the Nation  on Sunday when asked about the campaign s failure to focus on so-called  purple states  in 2016.Host Nancy Cordes noted that an indictment handed down by special counsel Robert Mueller on Friday showed that Russian operatives who meddled in the election appeared to realize the importance of focusing on those battleground contests. Then she goes in for the kill with this question: But it does beg the question, how is it that these Russian operatives knew to focus on purple states like Michigan and Wisconsin and your campaign didn t?  LOL! That s such a great snark-filled question!TRANSCRIPT OF FULL INTERVIEW:NANCY CORDES: Welcome back to  Face the Nation.  I m Nancy Cordes. Our next guest, John Podesta, was the chairman of Hillary Clinton s 2016 campaign. His private emails were hacked and released publicly by Russian-backed entities during the campaign. Mr. Podesta, thank you so much for being with us.JOHN PODESTA: Nice to be back, Nancy.NANCY CORDES: For anyone who voted for Hillary Clinton, these new indictments mean what?JOHN PODESTA: Well, look, it s a tragedy for the American people, really. As Mr. Mueller said in his indictment, this was an act of information warfare against the United States, against our democracy. So I think it s, obviously, disappointing to those of us who were on the receiving end of these Russian active measures, but I think the real victims here are the American people because there, there was direct interference with our democratic institutions.NANCY CORDES: The deputy attorney general was very careful on Friday to say that we don t know whether or not this operation swayed the election. You ve had a lot time think about this, where do you come down on that issue?JOHN PODESTA: Well, look, this was one part of a, of a complex, active interference in the measures. This didn t even deal with the hacking, this was only about what was going on in the social media and the, and the information campaign that was being done there, but there were 80 people, millions of dollars spent. And as one of your previous guests, Senator Coons noted, we won the popular vote by three million votes. They were pushing votes, just to give one example, to Jill Stein. Her vote in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin was greater than the gap between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in those states. So you can t prove that it did affect the outcome, but it certainly seems likely that it had some impact.NANCY CORDES: But it does beg the question, how is it that these Russian operatives knew to focus on purple states like Michigan and Wisconsin, and your campaign didn t?JOHN PODESTA: Well, of course, we spent a lot of time, energy, and effort in all those states.NANCY CORDES: Hillary Clinton, herself, did not spend much time in those states.JOHN PODESTA: We, you know, we had   Tim Kaine was there, Barack Obama was in   and she spent enormous time in Pennsylvania and Michigan.NANCY CORDES: Sure.JOHN PODESTA: And we spent a lot of effort. We had more staff in Wisconsin than even President Obama had in 2012. But, but I think that begs the question, I think we, we focused on the places we thought were that were you know in contest, and at the end of the day, we fell short in those states. And I think that this active measures effort by the Russians could have tilted the election in, in Donald Trump s favor. But I think what the real issue is, is how he s reacted to that. And in that context, if we re   if this is information warfare, then I think he s the first draft-dodger in the war. I mean, he has done nothing but tried to undermine the Mueller investigation, he hasn t implemented the sanctions that he   was passed by the congress and that he signed in reaction to the, to the activities in the 2016 election. We learned this week, he s ordered no effort to try to get the intelligence community to get together to try to prevent further activities in the 2018 election.NANCY CORDES: Why do you think that is? Do you think it s because to do so would be to admit that somehow the Russians might have influenced this election?JOHN PODESTA: Well, you know, I think that Mr. Trump s psyche is complicated and people have said a lot, a lot about it, but he certainly can t accept that this activity may have helped him, and I think he just constantly tries to move the ball away, including what was, I think, really a despicable tweet about the fact that he s blaming the FBI for investigating the Russia investigation and somehow relating that to the tragic killings in Florida. But you know who knows with Mr. Trump? But he clearly, I think, has failed in carrying out his duty as president of the United States, which is to protect our democracy.NANCY CORDES: Midterm elections are coming up, and it s been reported that Democrats are telling your former boss, Bill Clinton, that in light of the Me Too movement, they, they think he should sit it out, he should be benched, and they re not looking for him to actively campaign for them. Is that true? And do you think that that s the right call?JOHN PODESTA: Look, I think he remains, I think, a figure who is popular with a lot of Democrats across the country. And I think that people are calling him, candidates are calling him and asking for advice. But whether he s going to be an active participant, I think that s not you know really on the top of his mind right now. I think he s doing other things, and, and people make their own judgments about whether he can be helpful in the campaign.NANCY CORDES: Do you think it s a good idea, very quickly, for him to sit it out?JOHN PODESTA: Well, you know, look, I think that, that if I was advising a campaign and a candidate about what to do, I would, I would sort of judge whether he can be helpful. And I think some places he can be, and probably some places he s more of a lightning rod.NANCY CORDES: All right, John Podesta, thank you so much. Campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton. And we ll be right back with our panel of Republicans who are leaving the House and Senate.",0.0
"MULTIPLE FBI OFFICES Investigated Clinton Foundation BRIBERY Charges,financial crimes or influence-peddlingDOJ Appeared To Want To Slow Down Or Stop Investigation","A stunning story of corruption, cronyism and cover-ups and oh yeah, the Clinton s FBI investigators from across the country have been following leads into reports of bribery involving the Clinton Foundation. Multiple field offices have been involved in the investigation. A report in Sunday s Wall Street Journal (WSJ) by Devlin Barrett revealed that agents assigned to the New York field office have been carrying the bulk of the work in investigating the Clinton Foundation. They have received assistance from the FBI field office in Little Rock according to  people familiar with the matter, the WSJ reported. Other offices, including Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., have been collecting evidence regarding  financial crimes or influence-peddling. As far back as February 2016, FBI agents made the presentation to the Department of Justice (DOJ), the WSJ s sources stated.  The meeting didn t go well,  they wrote. While some sources said the FBI s evidence was not strong enough, others believed the DOJ had no intention from the start of going any further. Barrett wrote that the DOJ officials were  stern, icy and dismissive of the case. Barrett wrote,  That was one of the weirdest meetings I ve ever been to,  one participant told others afterward, according to people familiar with the matter. It appears there was rift between the FBI and the DOJ about how to move forward with the investigation. Agents in the Washington office were directed to focus on a separate issue related to the actions of former Virginia Governor and Clinton Foundation Board member Terry McAuliffe. Agents inside the FBI believed they could build a stronger case if the investigation of McAuliffe and the foundation were combined.FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe seemed to be caught in the middle of the fight between DOJ officials who appeared to want to slow down or shut down the investigation and FBI agents who were eager to pour more resources into the investigation.Barrett wrote,  Are you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?  Mr. McCabe asked, according to people familiar with the conversation. After a pause, the official replied,  Of course not,  these people said. Some of the WSJ sources told Barrett that a  stand down  order had been given to the FBI agents by McCabe. Others denied that no such order was given.The story gets more complicated when you factor in that McCabe s wife, Dr. Jill McCabe had received a $467,500 campaign contribution in 2015 for a state senate race from McAuliffe.For entire story: Breitbart",0.0
 Hispanic Rep Just Told Trump Where He Can Shove His Border Wall  And Its Epic,"Now that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has crossed the Rubicon of racism, the people are starting to lash out, and rightfully so.After  disqualifying  the Trump University judge because of his race, Republicans and Democrats alike have been holding Trump s feet to the fire   some more so than others. Most Republicans have simply disavowed his comments while some have flat out called him a fraud (and of course Democrats have been saying these things since June of last year).But the most glaring critique from any official came from Democratic Representative Filemon Vela of Texas, who penned a scathing open letter to Trump. Starting out by agreeing that Mexico should do more to deter cartel violence, Vela quickly amps up his attack, saying,  Your ignorant anti-immigrant opinions, your border wall rhetoric, and your recent bigoted attack on an American jurist are just plain despicable. Pretty standard criticism. But it gets so much better. Vela beats Trump at his own purity game, and notes that his ancestry is more  American  than Trump s, and that his family weren t chicken hawks: Before you dismiss me as just another  Mexican,  let me point out that my great-great grandfather came to this country in 1857, well before your own grandfather. His grandchildren (my grandfather and his brothers) all served our country in World War I and World War II. His great-grandson, my father, served in the U.S. Army and, coincidentally, was one of the first  Mexican  federal judges ever appointed to the federal bench. But the most telling and poignant line from Vela s letter was a good, old fashioned smackdown: Mr. Trump, you re a racist and you can take your border wall and shove it up your ass. This is by far the best response to Trump from any elected official. You know they all want to say it, but finally someone had the guts to actually come out and do it.And that s exactly what Donald Trump can do. Even if he were to be elected, there is no feasible way a wall would be built on the Mexican border and be financed by the Mexican government.Vela represents Texas  34th Congressional District, which makes up Corpus Christie and Brownsville. According to Census data, 60 percent of Corpus Christie s population is of Hispanic or Latino descent. In Brownsville, a border city, the Hispanic/Latino population accounted for 93 percent of its citizens.The proud people of Hispanic and Latino heritage of Texas  34th district can take solace in knowing they are being represented by a man who speaks for them to the fullest extent. If only this country had 100 more Filemon Vela s.Featured image a screen capture",0.0
Smugglers offer new routes to Europe for jobless Tunisians,"OFF THE TUNISIAN COAST (Reuters) - Tunisian smugglers are offering migrants seeking a fresh start in Europe a new route from Africa to Italy. Thousands have made the dangerous 300 km journey between Libya and the Italian island of Lampedusa this year and hundreds more are thought to have died trying to crossing the Mediterranean Sea to reach European shores. A crackdown by the Libyan coastguard in August has forced migrants and smugglers to find alternatives, giving Tunisians an opportunity to sell spots on overcrowded boats between the Gulf of Tunis and Sicily. The number of migrants trying to make the trip, which can be as short as 150 km, has jumped in the last month while fewer are leaving from Libya.  Most are Tunisians fleeing economic hardship at home. Others want to avoid increased navy patrols off Lampedusa and prefer to arrive on the larger island of Sicily where it is easier pass unnoticed. Penalties for smugglers and migrants are also light in Tunisia if you are caught.    The route to Sicily is not as heavily guarded as to Lampedusa,  said Hassen Rebhi, captain of a Tunisian coast guard captain whose boat patrols the waters off Tunisia. Libya is still a much bigger departure point for Europe with 108,000 reaching Italy from Libya in 2017, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). But Tunisian arrivals are on the rise with 1,400 in September, up from 1,350 in the first 8 months of the year. Many others are believed to have reached Sicily but escaped detection and identification. Tunisian coast guard officials said they had foiled 900 departure attempts in September compared to 170 in August. About 80 percent are Tunisians but there are also Libyans, Moroccans and sub-Saharan Africans. The route from Tunisia has been active before - some 20,000 left in 2011 as Tunisians tried to escape political turmoil when longtime president Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali was ousted. Tunisia won international praise for its democratic progress and the numbers seeking to leave fell but successive governments have failed to create jobs for young people. Some 40 km offshore, Rebhi s boat pulled up alongside an inflatable boat overloaded with 14 young Tunisian men who had been hoping to make it to Italy. The coast guards ordered them to switch off their engine and climb aboard the ship.        I watched many videos of young people who arrived in Italy. I have been unemployed for five years and don t have any hope things will get better in Tunisia,  said Anwar, a Tunisian who was shivering after spending 8 hours on the damp boat. European officials are worried about an influx of Tunisian jihadists. Thousands of Tunisians have left to fight for Islamic State. Some have also made their way to Europe including Anis Amri who killed 12 people when he plowed a truck through a Christmas market in Berlin.  Italy last week urged Tunisia to increase patrols, an Italian interior ministry spokesman said. It also wants to increase the number of Tunisians that can be repatriated from 30 a week to at least 80. Tunisia s navy has stepped up controls but the arrival of many in Sicily celebrating and dancing on beaches in social media posts is a powerful draw. All those in the inflatable vowed to try the crossing again.  I prefer to die in the sea than to stay in Tunisia without dignity,  said Hassan Chouchan, a 27-year-old who had lost his job as an entertainer in a tourist resort.  Please let us continue our journey. We do not want to stay here,  he shouted at the coast guard.    Frustrated young people openly discuss plans to leave. Families from Aweld Amer, a village near the tourist resort of Sousse where an Islamist militant shot dead 39 foreigners in 2015, told Reuters that at least 300 of the 4,000 residents had left for Italy. More than 600 youths in the southern city of Tataouin left, while more than 1500 young people left the coastal towns of Hargeleh, Monastir, Sfax, Chebba, Bizerte and Kelibia last month alone, residents said.  The government says it encourages private projects,  said 25-year old Borhan Sallem in Monastir, a port two-hours from Tunis.  When I wanted to get a loan to buy a fishing boat they refused it.   Reuters met him and a group of friends in the port of Monastir in presence of a smuggler, a fisherman, who brought them days later safely to Sicily, relatives confirmed. The interviews came abruptly to an and when a police car arrived at the port to monitor possible smuggling activity. But migrants and the smuggler said they were not worried about getting caught.  They also feel the trips are safe as the boats are driven by  fishermen who are less likely to abandon local people in rough seas than Libyan armed groups.   You get detained a few days and that s it. The trip is safe. I don t go with more than 30 to 50 people,  said the smuggler. Farhat Mansour, a 26-year-old Tunisian who paid a smuggler 3,000 Tunisian dinars ($1,223) for the journey to Sicily said the Italian police put him and others in a detention center when he arrived a month ago. Only those suspected of having militant ties were still being held.  Mansour has not found work and is living with under bridges with other Tunisians but has no regrets.  Here maybe the opportunities are few, but in Tunisia the opportunities are totally non-existent,  he said.  ",1.0
"Mexico replaces top U.S. diplomats, citing hostile climate","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexicos government on Tuesday unexpectedly changed two of its top officials responsible for U.S. relations, citing concerns about an increasingly anti-Mexican climate across the border. Carlos Sada, previously the consul in Los Angeles, was named ambassador to the United States while Paulo Carreno, one of President Enrique Pena Nietos communications chiefs, was appointed the deputy foreign minister for North America. The new ambassador must still be approved by the Senate. We have been warning that our citizens have begun to feel a more hostile climate, Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu told local radio after the announcement. This (anti-Mexican) rhetoric has made it clear that we have to act in a different way so that this tendency being generated doesnt damage the bilateral relationship, she added. Mexican government officials have expressed concern about the rise of Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump due to his repeated verbal attacks on Mexico, and his insistence that Mexico should be made to pay for a border wall. Trump on Tuesday threatened to block remittances from undocumented Mexican migrants if elected president unless the country pays billions for his planned wall. Trump also called Fords announcement that it would build more cars in Mexico an absolute disgrace. ",1.0
WATCH MSNBC LIBERAL HACKS Claim Conspiracy Between Trump and Putin On Syria Attack [Video],"Have these two been watching the news?The Russian President has immediately sent his Admiral Grigorovich frigate   armed with cruise missiles and a self-defence system   from the Black Sea to dock in Syria later. It will pass through the east Mediterranean waters where the USS Ross and USS Porter fired the 59 Tomahawk missiles that pounded Assad s al-Shayrat military airfield near Homs in the early hours of Friday. Bret Baier tweeted out the news: Putin today called it an  illegal act of aggression  and also ripped up an agreement to avoid mid-air clashes between Russian and US fighter jets over Syria. In the continuing fight back Russian or Syrian planes also bombed the town of Khan Sheikhoun, the scene of Tuesday s horrific chemical gas attack where 80 died, witnesses in the rebel-held area claimed. The US was also branded  a partner of ISIS  by al-Assad s spokesman, calling the missile strikes  reckless and irresponsible  and accused Trump of  naively falling  for a  false propaganda campaign  about the Idlib Sarin massacre.

French minister calls out Trump on climate change as Irma wreaks havoc,"PARIS (Reuters) - French Environment Minister Nicolas Hulot said on Friday extreme weather conditions like the powerful hurricane bearing down on Florida risked becoming the norm, and took a dig at U.S. President Donald Trump s stance on climate change. In an interview with France 2 TV about Hurricane Irma, Hulot implied that Trump - who has called global warming a hoax - was ignoring the reality of man-made climate change, which most mainstream scientists regard as an established fact. Trump said in May he was pulling the United States out of the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change that was brokered in Paris, saying it would harm the U.S. economy and cost jobs. Irma - described by Trump as a storm of  absolutely historic destructive potential  - pummeled Cuba and the Bahamas on Friday, and a second powerful hurricane was tracking towards the northeastern Caribbean. Asked if the storms might force Trump to rethink his  climate change policy, Hulot said:  What will change in the United States are the federal states, the cities, a whole section of society. I think that is what will make up for the reservations of the American president on the links between cause and effect.    ",1.0

"More than 100 dead in Philippine mudslides, flooding: officials","MANILA (Reuters) - A tropical storm in the southern Philippines triggered mudslides and flash floods that killed more than 100 people, while dozens are missing, police and disaster officials said on Saturday. The casualties, most of them caused late on Friday, were all on the main southern island of Mindanao, they said, adding three provinces were hardest hit. Disaster officials said many residents had ignored warnings to leave coastal areas and riverbanks.  Many people were swept to the sea as flood waters quickly rose due to the high tide,  Manuel Luis Ochotorena, a disaster agency official, said.  They never heeded the warnings. They thought it was a weak storm but it dumped more rains.   Hundreds of kilometers to the east, army and emergency workers were checking reports an entire village was buried by mudslide in Tubod town in Lanao del Norte. Ryan Cabus, a local official, said power and communication lines to the area had been cut, complicating rescue efforts. The weather bureau said the storm had gathered strength over the Sulu Sea and was packing winds of up 80 kph (50 mph) and moving west at 20 kph.  It was heading out over the sea by midday on Saturday and would have moved clear of the Philippines by Monday, it said. Emergency workers, soldiers, police and volunteers were being mobilized to search for survivors, clear debris, and restore power and communications. More than 100 deaths were reported in various places  including 60 in Tubod, El Salvador and Munai towns in Lanao del Norte province. In Zamboanga del Norte province, police said 42 people had been killed in the towns of Sibuco and Salug. Three people were killed in Bukidnon province, while politicians in Lanao del Sur province said 18 people had drowned in flash floods there. Sixty-four people were reported missing in floods and landslides, according to a tally of reports form officials and police. The Philippines is battered by about 20 typhoons every year, bringing death and destruction, usually to the poorest communities.  Last week, 46 people were killed in the central Philippines when a typhoon hit. In 2013, super typhoon Haiyan killed nearly 8,000 people and left 200,000 families homeless.    ",1.0
U.S.-backed campaign against IS in eastern Syria to speed up: SDF militia,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - A U.S.-backed campaign against Islamic State in eastern Syria will accelerate now the jihadist group has been defeated in its former capital Raqqa, a spokesman for U.S.-allied Syrian militias said on Wednesday. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which announced the defeat at Raqqa on Tuesday, will redeploy fighters from the city to frontlines with Islamic State in the eastern province of Deir al-Zor, Talal Silo told Reuters by telephone. Islamic State is already losing ground rapidly in Deir al-Zor, the last region where it has a significant foothold in Syria. The SDF and the Syrian government, backed by Russia and Iran, are fighting separate campaigns against the group there. Silo said the Raqqa victory would have a  positive impact  on the SDF s campaign in Deir al-Zor because it meant fighters could be redeployed as internal security forces take control of Raqqa.  Most of the military forces will head towards these areas to continue the participation in the campaign with the Deir al-Zor Military Council,  he said. The Council is a militia leading the SDF s campaign in the province.  This is all to the benefit of the campaign and accelerating the end of this campaign,  he said. The SDF s campaign has been focused on areas east of the Euphrates River, which bisects Deir al-Zor province. The government s campaign has focused mostly in areas to the west of the river. The U.S.-led coalition and Russian military are holding face-to-face deconfliction meetings   to prevent inadvertent clashes between planes and troops under their respective commands - though the campaigns have occasionally come into conflict near the Euphrates River.   The Syrian army and its allies are battling for control of the last remaining IS-held areas of Deir al-Zor city, and have also recently captured the town of al-Mayadin from IS. The U.S.-led coalition said it would be pushing further into Deir al-Zor province to clear remaining Islamic State fighters, but there is no plan for SDF fighters to move into Deir al-Zor city itself.   Our goal is to defeat (Islamic State) in Iraq and Syria and if there are still areas where they hold territory then we will do what we can to clear those areas,  Col. Ryan Dillon, the coalition spokesman, said. The last major Islamic State-held town in Deir al-Zor is Albu Kamal, which is the last Syrian town before the Iraqi border. ",1.0
 Rapist Cop Daniel Holtzclaw Disappears From Prison Database (IMAGES),"In December of 2015, a jury found former Oklahoma City police officer Daniel Holtzclaw guilty on 18 counts of sexual assault and rape. A month later, on January 21, 2016, Judge Timothy Henderson sentenced the serial rapist to a consecutive 263 year prison term.But on Friday, Oklahoma City s NBC affiliate KFOR reported that Holtzclaw s name had  disappeared  from the Oklahoma Department of Corrections website.On Tuesday the database showed the following information on Holtzclaw.Image credit, KFORThree days later, on January 29, the database showed no record of Holtclaw at all.Image credit: KFOR KFOR contacted the state Department of Corrections, only to be told by a department spokesperson  We are not going to comment, it is a matter of security. Holtzclaw was convicted of sexually assaulting seven women and he is believed to have victimized many others. All but one of his victims were Black women. His youngest victim was just 17 years old, while his oldest victim was a 57-year-old grandmother of 12.Under Oklahoma law, Holtzclaw s victims have very specific rights, including the right to know his location.The state Attorney General s office and law enforcement agencies provide this information via the VINELink website, which is supposed to be updated daily with changes in offender status.Holtzclaw still shows up in the VINELink database, but his location is now listed as  unknown. Image credit: KFORAccording to KFOR, Holtzclaw s victims have not been notified of any change in status or location, although Oklahoma law requires that crime victims be notified of any such changes.Alex Gerszewsk, an Oklahoma Department of Corrections spokesperson refused to provide KFOR with information on Holtzclaw s whereabouts, saying only that he was  processed at Lexington exactly as every other offender. Gerszewsk repeated the same  security  claim, saying  we cannot reveal his location for security; the security of the inmate and the facility. The state Department of Corrections and the VINELink publish the information of all offenders, including pedophiles, child abductors, serial killers and hundreds of other people who have committed every horrific and violent crime imaginable.There s little doubt that those criminals would like to have their information deleted from the Department of Corrections website as well. I m sure they d like to have their whereabouts kept confidential for  security reasons,  since those crimes are likely to get you beaten, raped or killed in prison.There s just one difference between Holtzclaw and every other serial rapist incarcerated in Oklahoma. Holtzclaw is a former police officer.The Oklahoma Department of Corrections seems to think it s OK to break the law and violate the rights of the women Holtzclaw raped and sexually assaulted, by removing his information from their database and concealing his whereabouts.This is completely unacceptable. It is the duty of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections to protect crime victims, not serial rapists who just happen to be former cops.Featured image credit: VINELink ",0.0

Approximately 1,000 people attended the  summer celebration  event at the Pilgrim Monument & Museum in Provincetown, including the 70-year-old  Believe  singer, who did not perform, according to the Cape Cod Times.She then travels to the Hamptons in New York this weekend for even more fundraising events.The Clinton campaign s decision to prioritize private fundraisers over public campaign events appears to be twofold.Hollywood A-lister Jennifer Garner hosted a fundraiser for the Democratic nominee for president Hillary R. Clinton campaign Thursday, Aug. 18th at the home of Benjamin and Penelope Pierce from 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. Thursday, according to the Bozeman Daily Chronicle.Jennifer Garner, the star of Dude, Where s My Car? is a active supporter of Democratic candidates.

" Bernie Sanders PUMMELS Trump, Gives Him PERFECT Nickname In The Process (TWEET)","President-elect Donald Trump needs his Twitter account confiscated as soon as possible. Every time he sends out an impulsive, ego-driven tweet, he is either embarrassing the country or putting it in grave danger. A need for Trump s Twitter privileges to be taken away was perfectly displayed earlier this week, when Trump started talking about nuclear weapons.Trump was first inspired by a statement made by Russian leader Vladimir Putin, which resulted in him tweeting that the United States needs to greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability.  Then, Trump tried to clarify his comments and only became more irresponsible. During a phone call, he told MSNBC s Mika Brzezinski, let it be an arms race. We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all.  Terrifying.Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders took Trump head on Friday afternoon, when he criticized the future President of the United States for his idiocy. Taking to Trump s preferred announcement medium, Sanders tweeted: Congress must not allow the Tweeter in Chief to unleash a dangerous and costly nuclear arms race. TwitterIt should be no surprise that Sanders would pummel Trump on this   Sanders made his feelings about nuclear weapons known last year when he said: We are spending hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining 5,000 nuclear weapons. I think we need major reform in the military making it more cost effective but also focusing on the real crisis that faces us. Sanders is spot on to call Trump out on how deadly his lack of experience and decision-making skills are   and Trump is definitely more of a Tweeter in Chief than a Commander in Chief. He hasn t shaped up at all to be a respectable future leader since he won the election.The fact that Trump is being so reckless with the future of the country (and the world) is reason enough to believe that we ve clearly elected the wrong person   and this is something even Trump s supporters can t deny. Nuclear weapons are nothing to be messing with on social media. George Shultz, former Secretary of State under Ronald Reagan, has called them the world s biggest threat. In his book, Shultz wrote: Their effect in preventing wars has been overrated and reports of the damage they cause tend to be brushed aside to depend on nuclear deterrence indefinitely into the future, especially when other means of deterrence are available, is foolhardy. It s obviously a book that Trump should be reading. But since Trump doesn t read books unless they re about Adolf Hitler, maybe he ll see Sanders  tweet.Featured image is a screenshot",0.0
TRANSGENDER ANTIFA THUG Starts To Burn American FlagPro-Trump Biker Gives Him Big Surprise [VIDEO],"Climate march s are happening all over America. Many of the same groups like Antifa who turned out to burn, riot and loot in Washington DC during Trump s inauguration and who ve been turning up in Berkeley, CA to shut down speech rights of conservatives came to show their disdain for America. A transgender man was caught lighting a small American flag on fire and holding it up like a small child at show-and-tell to share with his anti-American friends.

Top US Spy Agency Refuses to Endorse CIAs Russian Hacking Assessment Due to Lack Of Evidence,"21st Century Wire says If anyone still thinks this whole  Russian hacking  plot is not motivated by internal US politics   think again Tyler Durden Zero HedgeWhen the WaPo posted last Friday s story about a  secret  CIA assessment that Russian cyber attacks were aimed at helping Republican President-elect Donald Trump win the 2016 election, the readers of the Bezos-owned publication took it as gospel, despite, as we promptly noted, there being no evidence provided by the CIA, and as we learned today, the FBI openly resisting the CIA s assessment. It now appears that once again the WaPo may have been engaging in  partial fake news , as it did with its Nov. 24 story about  Russian propaganda fake media. According to Reuters, the so-called overseers of the U.S. intelligence community as it supervises the 17 agency-strong U.S. intelligence community, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), while not disputing the CIA s analysis of Russian hacking operations   something which would be unprecedented for the US spy industry and would telegraph just how partisan and broken the country s intelligence apparatus has become   has refused to endorse the CIA s assessment  because of a lack of conclusive evidence  that Moscow intended to boost Trump over Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.As Reuters conveniently notes, the ODNI position could give Trump fresh ammunition to dispute the CIA assessment, which he rejected as  ridiculous  in weekend remarks, and press his assertion that no evidence implicates Russia in the cyber attacks. The ODNI s position confirms that Trump was once again, you guessed it, right.

"COLLEGE CAMPUS BANS Chalk, Fears Students Might Write Trump Word On Campus Sidewalks","Remember when college campuses were considered a  safe space  for political and social debate?DePaul University will no longer allow students to chalk political messages on the sidewalks of its campus because of the  offensive, hurtful, and divisive  nature of pro-Trump chalking found on campus last week. While these chalk messages are part of national agendas in a heated political battle, they appeared on campus at a time of significant racial tension in our country and on college campuses. DePaul is no exception,  Depaul s vice president for student affairs Eugene Zdziarski wrote in a campus-wide email obtained by Campus Reform.  The university has been addressing campus climate issues in an effort to provide an inclusive and supportive educational environment. In this context, many students, faculty and staff found the chalk messages offensive, hurtful and divisive. Consequently, Zdziarski explained that DePaul s status as a 501(c)3 tax-exempt non-profit organization prohibits students from participating in any political activity that could be interpreted as a reflection of the university s  views or opinions.  Political chalking on Depaul s grounds, Zdziarski argued, fits this description.Last week, Depaul s College Republicans organized a chalking campaign on campus, during which phrases such as  Make DePaul great again,   Blue Lives Matter,  and  Trump Train 2016  were scrawled on the sidewalks.The campus grounds crew removed the chalkings the following morning but cited routine maintenance as one of the reasons for their removal. After some investigation, it turns out this happened for two reasons,  the university wrote in a statement.  First, the crew regularly cleans up chalk messages on our sidewalks. This is a part of their duties. Secondly, some among the crew considered the messages inflammatory. The crew has agreed to consult about such matters in the future. Although the grounds crew  regularly cleans up chalk messages,  meaning DePaul students regularly chalk their campus  sidewalks, this appears to be the first time university officials have expressly addressed their chalking policies. Zdziarski noted, after the Trump chalkings appeared, that students are not even allowed to chalk on sidewalks at all. Students or student organizations may not post partisan political flyers, posters, signs or images on University bulletin board, buildings, electronic message boards, forums or sidewalks. This includes chalking on campus property,  he said.Via: Campus Reform",0.0
Trump lays out non-interventionist U.S. military policy,"FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump laid out a U.S. military policy on Tuesday that would avoid interventions in foreign conflicts and instead focus heavily on defeating the Islamic State militancy. In the latest stop on a thank you tour of states critical to his Nov. 8 election win, Trump introduced his choice for defense secretary, General James Mattis, to a large crowd in this city near the Fort Bragg military base, which has deployed soldiers to 90 countries around the world. We will stop racing to topple foreign regimes that we know nothing about, that we shouldnt be involved with, Trump said. Instead, our focus must be on defeating terrorism and destroying ISIS, and we will. Trumps rhetoric was similar to what he said during the election campaign when he railed against the war in Iraq. In Fayetteville, he vowed a strong rebuilding of the U.S. military, which he suggested has been stretched too thin. Instead of investing in wars, he said, he would spend money to build up Americas aging roads, bridges and airports. Even so, Trump said he wants to boost spending on the military. To help pay for his buildup, Trump pledged to seek congressional approval for lifting caps on defense spending that were part of sequestration legislation that imposed cut spending across the board. We dont want to have a depleted military because were all over the place fighting in areas that we shouldnt be fighting in. Its not going to be depleted any longer, he said. Trump said any nation that shares these goals will be considered a U.S. partner. We dont forget. We want to strengthen old friendships and seek out new friendships, he said. He said the policy of intervention and chaos must come to an end. While U.S. armed forces are deployed in far-flung places around the globe, they are only involved currently in active combat in the Middle East, specifically Iraq and Syria for the most part. We will build up our military not as an act of aggression, but as an act of prevention, he said. In short, we seek peace through strength. Trump described Mattis as the right person for the job and urged Congress to approve a waiver to let him take on the civilian position. Under U.S. law a military leader must be retired for seven years before becoming eligible to become defense secretary. Speaking to the crowed, Mattis said, I look forward to being the civilian leader as long as the Congress gives me the waiver and the Senate votes to consent. Were going to get you that waiver, Trump said, returning to the microphone. If you dont get that waiver there are going to be a lot of angry people. ",1.0
Figures show Trump spent $66 million of his own cash on election campaign,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump pumped a total of $66 million of his own money into his campaign - far from the $100 million he frequently boasted he was going to spend, according to campaign finance disclosures filed on Thursday night. Trump-related business industries - those bearing his own name, including his private jet and the Manhattan building that served as his campaign headquarters - received $11 million in payments from his campaign.  Trump shocked the political world when he defeated Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election for the White House, overcoming a spending deficit and outperforming polls in several swing states to propel him to victory.  Earlier this week, Trumps campaign revealed that he sold his entire stock portfolio in June, a holding that was estimated at about $40 million. Opting to liquidate his assets could have been a move to pump cash into his campaign, which at the time was struggling to raise funds from private donors. The move to sell his stocks came weeks after he forgave about $47 million in loans he had already given his campaign.  In total, Trump raised $339 million and spent $322 million - a far cry from the $565 million spent by Clinton, according to the latest Federal Election Commission disclosure reports. Trump spent $94 million in the final days of the campaign, compared with the $132 million spent by Clinton. Trump frequently promised to run a shoe-string campaign and argued his self-funding model meant he wasnt obligated to any special interests. He blasted polling as a useless art and pollsters as a waste of money as he overcame 16 Republican foes during the primary election season in early 2016. Trump rode to victory on more than $5 billion in free television on news programs that provided wall-to-wall coverage of his every word, according to data analytics firm mediaQuant. But when the realities of the general election began to sink in - and Trumps poll numbers sank - he shifted and began spending money on polling and television ads.  In total, Trump spent $107 million on advertising, including television ads, and another $85 million in digital and online advertising. His second largest expense was air travel, totaling $26 million and accounting for more campaign spending than his payroll. ",1.0
"Trump administration approves tougher visa vetting, including social media checks","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration has rolled out a new questionnaire for U.S. visa applicants worldwide that asks for social media handles for the last five years and biographical information going back 15 years. The new questions, part of an effort to tighten vetting of would-be visitors to the United States, was approved on May 23 by the Office of Management and Budget despite criticism from a range of education officials and academic groups during a public comment period.  Critics argued that the new questions would be overly burdensome, lead to long delays in processing and discourage international students and scientists from coming to the United States. Under the new procedures, consular officials can request all prior passport numbers, five years' worth of social media handles, email addresses and phone numbers and 15 years of biographical information including addresses, employment and travel history. (bit.ly/2qBSrpv) Officials will request the additional information when they determine that such information is required to confirm identity or conduct more rigorous national security vetting, a State Department official said on Wednesday. The State Department said earlier the tighter vetting would apply to visa applicants who have been determined to warrant additional scrutiny in connection with terrorism or other national security-related visa ineligibilities. President Donald Trump has vowed to increase national security and border protections, proposing to give more money to the military and make Mexico pay to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. He has tried to implement a temporary travel ban on people from six Muslim-majority nations that a U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate, calling it discriminatory and setting the stage for a showdown in the Supreme Court. The Office of Management and Budget granted emergency approval for the new questions for six months, rather than the usual three years.  While the new questions are voluntary, the form says failure to provide the information may delay or prevent the processing of an individual visa application. Immigration lawyers and advocates say the request for 15 years of detailed biographical information, as well as the expectation that applicants remember all their social media handles, is likely to catch applicants who make innocent mistakes or do not remember all the information requested.  The new questions grant arbitrary power to consular officials to determine who gets a visa with no effective check on their decisions, said Babak Yousefzadeh, a San Francisco-based attorney and president of the Iranian American Bar Association. The United States has one of the most stringent visa application processes in the world, Yousefzadeh said. The need for tightening the application process further is really unknown and unclear. ",1.0
 GOP Lawmaker: A Lady Needs To Be Told When Shes Being Nasty,"A Texas lawmaker just defended Donald Trump s remark toward Hillary Clinton during the third and final presidential debate. Clinton was discussing Social Security and Medicare when Donald interrupted her to say the Democratic presidential nominee is  such a nasty woman.  Apparently Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX) agrees with Donald. You know what, she s saying some nasty things,  Babin told Alan Colmes on this show. You think it s appropriate to call her a nasty woman?  Colmes asked. Well, I m a genteel Southerner, Alan,  Babin replied. So that means no?  Colmes asked. The radio host had to repeatedly press Babin to answer the question. You re ducking me, Congressman,  Colmes said when Babit tried to pivot the topic to immigration. No, I think sometimes a lady needs to be told when she s being nasty. Oh, really?  Colmes asked.Babin replied,  I do. My assessment is that Mrs. Clinton has got so much baggage,  Babin continued.  I think she s done some nasty things. Colmes asked Babin about Trump s  rigged  election  rhetoric.  We re going to have to agree to disagree,  Babin said.The Texas lawmaker went on to blame the media for Trump s negative coverage.Colmes asked who he thought would win in November.  Im sure hoping that Mr. Trump wins,  Babin said.Audio courtesy of CNN:Babin initially backed Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) but later threw his support behind the GOP presidential nominee.We re glad that Babin brought up  nasty things.  Trump was recently outed in a video bragging about sexually assaulting women in 1995. Since then, he s gone on to call women fat, slobs, pigs and dogs. He s attacked his sexual assault accusers  looks. The man-baby candidate is whipping his supporters into a frenzy by telling crowds that the election is  rigged.   Trump is a Nasty Man. But thank you, Babin, for mansplaining that women need to be put in their place.The word  genteel  doesn t mean what the Texas lawmaker thinks it means.Image: Gage Skidmore via Flickr",0.0
Not a wordThats What The Parents Of Beautiful Young Woman Murdered By Illegal Alien In Sanctuary City Have Heard From White House [VIDEO],"Kate Steinle is the  wrong race, and she was killed by someone Obama is advocating for. If they can only get FOX News to stop reporting about it, this whole nightmare for Obama s executive amnesty/votes for Democrats program will go away The parents of Kathryn Steinle said Monday in a cable television news interview that they support a proposal to give mandatory prison time to deported people who return to the U.S. illegally. Steinle, 32, was walking along a waterfront in San Francisco when she was shot by a gun allegedly fired by Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez, a Mexican national who was in the country illegally. Steinle s brother also appeared on Fox and revealed to Megyn Kelly that the White House hasn t even bothered to reach out to the family. Not heard a word,  Brad Steinle said. Instead, he said,  we find solace in the fact that Kate was doing what she loved and she was with the man she loved the most, my dad. WATCH VIDEO INTERVIEW WITH BILL O REILLY HERE:Sanchez, 45, who has pleaded not guilty, had been released from jail months before the shooting, despite a federal immigration order asking local authorities to hold him.Jim Steinle and Liz Sullivan, of Pleasanton, California, were interviewed by Fox News talk-show host Bill O Reilly for a Monday segment on The O Reilly Factor.The death of their daughter has fueled a national debate on immigration, with advocates of stricter border control and even some Bay Area Democrats denouncing San Francisco as a city whose immigrant  sanctuary  protections harbor people who are in the country illegally.Supporters of sanctuary protections have jumped on O Reilly and others for politicizing the death. They say public safety is improved when immigrants can work with local police without fear of deportation.Steinle, who was at his daughter s side when she was shot, and his wife said the proposed  Kate s Law  would be a good way to keep her memory alive. O Reilly is collecting signatures for the petition, which would impose a mandatory five years in federal prison for people who are deported and return. We feel the federal, state and cities their laws are here to protect us,  Jim Steinle said.  But we feel that this particular set of circumstances and the people involved, the different agencies let us down. It ll be a legacy in her name and her death would not go unnoticed. The grieving parents said failings at multiple levels of government led to Sanchez being freed, but they re tired of finger-pointing.  Ff  Kate s Law  saves one person, then it s all for good,  said Steinle.Federal records show Sanchez had been deported three times before being sentenced to more than five years in federal prison. He had completed another four years in federal prison when he was shipped to San Francisco March 26 on an outstanding 1995 drug charge.The San Francisco District Attorney s office declined to prosecute, given the age of the case and the small amount of marijuana involved.Via: UK Daily Mail",0.0
Exclusive: White House declines to support encryption legislation - sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is declining to offer public support for draft legislation that would empower judges to require technology companies such as Apple Inc to help law enforcement crack encrypted data, sources familiar with the discussions said. The decision all but assures that the years-long political impasse over encryption will continue even in the wake of the high-profile effort by the Department of Justice to force Apple to break into an iPhone used by a gunman in last Decembers  shootings in San Bernardino, California. President Obama suggested in remarks last month that he had come around to the view that law enforcement agencies needed to have a way to gain access to encrypted information on smartphones.  But the administration remains deeply divided on the issue, the sources said.  The draft legislation from Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, the Republican chair and top Democrat respectively of the Senate Intelligence Committee, is expected to be introduced as soon as this week.  The bill gives federal judges broad authority to order tech companies to help the government but does not spell out what companies might have to do or the circumstances under which they could be ordered to help, according to sources familiar with the text. It also does not create specific penalties for noncompliance. Although the White House has reviewed the text and offered feedback, it is expected to provide minimal public input, if any, the sources said.  Its stance is partly a reflection of a political calculus that any encryption bill would be controversial and is unlikely to go far in a gridlocked Congress during an election year, sources said.  A White House spokesman declined to comment on the pending legislation, but referred to White House press secretary Josh Earnests statements on encryption legislation. Last month Earnest said the administration is skeptical of lawmakers ability to resolve the encryption debate given their difficulty in tackling simple things. Tech companies and civil liberties advocates have opposed encryption legislation, arguing that mandating law enforcement access to tech products will undermine security for everyone. Several lawmakers, including U.S. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a Democrat, have vowed to oppose any attempt to limit encryption protections in U.S. technology products. Even some intelligence officials worry that enabling law enforcement agencies to override encryption will create more problems than it solves by opening the door to hackers and foreign intelligence services. Some also say it is unnecessary because the government has other means of getting the information it needs.   The Justice Department dropped its legal action against Apple last week, saying it had found a way to hack into the phone.  The White House last year backed away from pursuing legislation that would require U.S. technology firms to provide a back door to access encrypted data. The backpedaling resembled a retreat by President Bill Clintons administration in the 1990s on efforts to require a special computer chip in  phones to give the U.S. government a way to monitor encrypted conversations.      But the desire for encryption legislation among some intelligence and law enforcement officials has never gone away, and it gained new life after the Islamist militant-inspired attacks in Paris and San Bernardino.  Obama, speaking at the South by Southwest entertainment festival in Austin, Texas, last month, warned against fetishizing our phones and said that doing nothing to address law enforcements encryption challenges cant be the right answer.  Obama, however, also cautioned against Congress taking any action that would be sloppy and rushed. Apple and others have called on Congress to help find a solution to the problem of criminals and terrorists using encryption to avoid surveillance. A separate proposal to form a national encryption commission to further study the issue is also not expected to be enacted this year. Meanwhile, tech companies are stepping up their efforts to implement encryption and other security measures. The Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp announced this week that it had implemented complete encryption of its service - and now cannot get access to customer messages even if was ordered to by a court.

 Republicans PROVE They Believe In Party Over Country With One Incredibly Stupid Question,"Congress is chest-deep in their leak investigations, with FBI Director James Comey in the hot seat today. During the House Intelligence Committee hearing, chairman Devin Nunes thought he d try and ask some really hard-hitting questions, maybe in an attempt to trap Comey into saying something that will incriminate everyone who isn t Republican in the increasingly tangled web that is the Russia scandal.All he did was prove that this is about Republicans desperately puffing up their party instead of actually getting to the bottom of possible treason. And he did it with just one question: If this committee or anyone else for that matter, someone from the public, comes with information to you about the Hillary Clinton campaign, or their associates, or someone from the Clinton Foundation, will you add that to your investigation? Really? He s trying to make this about Hillary, despite consensus that Russia acted in the interest of Trump? It certainly sounded like that s what Nunes was doing when he followed up with: If they have ties to Russian intelligence services, Russian agents, would that be something of interest to you? Comey would not fall into Nunes  trap, though. He replied with: If people bring us information about what they think is improper, unlawful activity of any kind, we will evaluate it. Not just in this context. Folks send us stuff all the time. They should keep doing that. Nunes may well by trying to follow Trump s lead on this, as Trump regularly throws Twitter tantrums in childish attempts to deflect blame. Trump is livid   Comey s statements that the FBI is, indeed, investigating the Russian scandal are infuriating to him. As such, he s still all over Twitter trying to convince us that the real problem is the leaks, and that Hillary s a traitor and a crook and we supposedly all know it, rather than all the evidence piling up against him.What about all of the contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians? Also, is it true that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2017Is it a coincidence that Nunes would also ask about Hillary? Likely not. Nunes and the rest of the GOP should give us a call when they re ready to actually go to work.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",0.0

"Trump assails GM over car production in Mexico, threatens tax","DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to impose a big border tax on General Motors Co (GM.N) for making some of its Chevrolet Cruze compact cars in Mexico, an arrangement the largest U.S. automaker defended as part of its strategy to serve global customers, not sell them in the United States. Trumps comments marked his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs before he takes office on Jan. 20, signaling an uncommon degree of intervention for an incoming U.S. president into corporate affairs. General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax! Trump said in a post on Twitter. Trump did not provide further details but previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Trumps tweet came hours before GMs rival Ford Motor Co (F.N) announced it would cancel a planned $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and would invest $700 million at a Michigan factory, after it also came under criticism from the Republican president-elect for its Mexican investment plans. Fords executive chairman, Bill Ford Jr., said he personally notified Trump of the decision, but after Trumps early-morning GM tweet. GM, the worlds No. 3 automaker, said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, or about 185,500, were built at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio. About 4,500 hatchback versions of the Cruze were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S. it said in a statement posed on its website.  The Cruze is one of GMs best-selling cars, although its sales numbers were down significantly in 2016. Shares of GM (GM.N) rose 1 percent to $35.19 after falling about 1 percent following Trumps tweet before the market opened. Since winning the Nov. 8 presidential election, Trump has targeted GMs rival Ford Motor Co (F.N), United Technologies Inc (UTX.N), Boeing Co (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N). Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including Uniteds Carrier unit in Indiana. In this case, the tweet was specific to General Motors. But I think youve seen an overall philosophy during the campaign and since he was elected to stand up for American workers and make sure that American companies dont benefit from moving their companies overseas and leaving American workers behind, Trump transition team spokesman Sean Spicer said. Last month, Trump announced the formation of a council to advise him on job creation comprised of leaders from a variety of major U.S. corporations including GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra. GM said in 2015 it would build its next-generation Chevrolet Cruze compact in Mexico as automakers look to expand in the Latin American nation to take advantage of low labor costs and free trade agreements. The company said in 2015 it would invest $350 million to produce the Cruze at its plant in Coahuila as part of the $5 billion investment in its Mexican plants announced in 2014, creating 5,600 jobs. GM said last year it would import some Cruze cars from Mexico.    Trump, a Republican who will succeed Democratic President Barack Obama, campaigned for president using tough rhetoric on trade and promises to protect American workers, and targeted several companies by name. According to Automotive News, GM began producing the Cruze in Mexico last year, making 52,631 cars there. In comparison, it built 319,536 of them in the United States. Previous versions of the Cruze sold in Mexico were made in a GM South Korea plant, it reported.    The shift is part of a larger trend among Detroits Big Three automakers to produce more small cars for the North American market in Mexico in an effort to lower labor costs, while using higher-paid U.S. workers to build more profitable trucks, sport utility vehicles and luxury cars. In November, GM said it planned in early 2017 to lay off 2,000 employees at two U.S. auto plants, including the one in Lordstown. U.S. small car sales have been hurt by lagging consumer demand and low gas prices. GMs U.S. Cruze sales were down 18 percent through November. GM will halt the third shift at the Lordstown plant on Jan. 23, cutting 1,250 jobs. ",1.0
 Oregon Judge Politely Mocks Cliven Bundys Lunatic Demands (VIDEO),"Last week, Oregon Judge Steve Grasty issued a statement that could be summed up as  Geddafugouttahere!  The statement was directed to head Domestic Terrorist Cliven Bundy who s been overcome with delusions of power. Bundy has declared that the four morons still inside the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge will  retain possession  of the property and he s also demanding that local officials resign because they haven t been America-Lovin  Christian Soldier For Freedom fully supportive of the Bundy militia s seizure of federal property. Judge Gratsy seemed a bit confused as to why some schmuck in Nevada thinks he can dictate the law in Oregon: Last night I got a tweet with a copy of the letter in it from Mr. Cliven Bundy. I looked at that and wondered what does that mean? Perhaps he thinks he owns the refuge. I don t think that s the case. Judge Gratsy also responded to a petition to arrest the officers involved with the 100 percent justified shooting of martyr moron Lavoy Finicum: This isn t a valid petition in any sense of the law that I understand,  Grasty told KOIN 6 News on Tuesday.  That request won t be honored. Even funnier, the  patriots  that have been protesting clearly don t know how to count: Mr. Curtiss said [the petition] it was 200 signatures. What was delivered to us has lines for 150 signatures and it 118 signatures on them,  the judge said. We think we can identify 111 of those as maybe Harney County folks. That sums up the Bundy clown parade perfectly: Ignorant of the law, very angry and very, very stupid. With a lot of guns. What could possibly go wrong?Since this story was first reported on, Cliven Bundy has been arrested for trying to join up with domestic terrorists and the four boneheads at Malhuer are reportedly in the process of surrendering after demanding that they not be arrested.Here s the full story via KOIN6: Featured image via AI Archives",0.0

The citizens of Venezuela have endured immense suffering, poverty, starvation, and dangerous political unrest under Maduro s oppressive socialist regime.  ",1.0
"Iranian general, Assad discuss joint military strategy: report","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iran s military chief met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Thursday during a visit to Damascus to set out a joint military strategy, Syria s state news agency reported, a sign of deepening Iranian influence that has alarmed Israel. General Mohammad Baqeri said Iran was determined to continue supporting the Syrian leadership and people  until security and safety are returned to them  and would help with reconstruction, the state news agency SANA said. Israel has voiced deep concern over Tehran s widening influence in Syria, where Iranian forces and Iran-backed militias including Lebanon s Hezbollah have played a critical role helping Assad in the six-year-long war.     On Tuesday, Baqeri, speaking from Damascus, warned Israel against breaching Syrian airspace and territory and pledged to increase cooperation with Syria s military to fight both Israel and Sunni jihadist militants. Israel s air force says it has struck arms convoys of the Syrian military and Hezbollah nearly 100 times during the war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Iran was strengthening its foothold in Syria and that Israel would  do whatever it takes  to protect its security. Tensions have risen this year between Lebanon s Hezbollah and Israel, which have avoided a major conflict since 2006.     In the meeting with Baqeri, Assad said the Iranian people and armed forces were a key partner in victories  against terrorism in Syria , SANA reported.   Military support from Iran and Russia has helped Assad regain swathes of Syria from rebels and Islamic State militants. ",1.0

"Clinton to release 2015 tax returns within days, criticizes Trump","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will release her 2015 tax returns and her running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, will release the last 10 years of their tax returns within days, according to a source close to Clinton. The returns will show Clinton paid an effective tax rate of 35 percent and gave about 10 percent to charity, CNBC reported. The release comes as Republican Donald Trump is facing criticism for not releasing his tax returns - a political practice that is not required by law but has been done by every White House nominee since 1973. He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns, Clinton said on Thursday in an economic speech in Michigan.   Clintons campaign has already released tax returns going back to 2007. In addition, tax returns are publicly available for the eight years her husband, former President Bill Clinton, was in the White House. Prior years were released by his campaign. Tax returns filed by the Clintons have been made public, in some form, for every year back to 1977. Trump, a New York businessman, has refused to release his tax returns, saying they are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. He has said he is unlikely to do so before the Nov. 8 presidential election.  Critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have blasted Trump for failing to disclose his tax rate and raised questions about what his returns say about his net worth and various business ties, particularly in Russia.     Asked in a television interview in May what tax rate he pays, Trump replied Its none of your business. The IRS has said Trump can release his tax returns even while under audit. Besides showing sources and amounts of income, tax returns show what percentage tax rate a person ultimately pays, as well as how much they claimed in deductions and the amounts given to charities.   Earlier this month, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, billionaire investor Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to make his returns public. Im under audit, too, and I would be delighted to meet him anyplace, anytime, before the election, Buffett said. Ill bring my tax return, he can bring his tax return ... and let people ask us questions. Trump has declined to do so.  ",1.0

WHY THIS Democrat Stronghold County Voted For TrumpAnd Why Theyll Vote For Him Again: Hes a fighternobodys gonna push him into a corner [VIDEO],"AP News  The regulars amble in before dawn and claim their usual table, the one next to an old box television playing the news on mute.Steven Whitt fires up the coffee pot and flips on the fluorescent sign in the window of the Frosty Freeze, his diner that looks and sounds and smells about the same as it did when it opened a half-century ago. Coffee is 50 cents a cup, refills 25 cents. The pot sits on the counter, and payment is based on the honor system.People like it that way, he thinks. It reminds them of a time before the world seemed to stray away from them, when coal was king and the values of the nation seemed the same as the values here, in God s Country, in this small county isolated in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.Everyone in town comes to his diner for nostalgia and homestyle cooking. And, recently, news reporters come from all over the world to puzzle over politics   because Elliott County, a blue-collar union stronghold, voted for the Democrat in each and every presidential election for its 147-year existence.Until Donald Trump came along and promised to wind back the clock. He was the hope we were all waiting on, the guy riding up on the white horse. There was a new energy about everybody here,  says Whitt. I still see it. Despite the president s dismal approval ratings and lethargic legislative achievements, he remains profoundly popular here in these mountains, a region so badly battered by the collapse of the coal industry it became the symbolic heart of Trump s white working-class base.The frenetic churn of the national news, the ceaseless Twitter taunts, the daily declarations of outrage scroll soundlessly across the bottom of the diner s television screen, rarely registering. When they do, Trump doesn t shoulder the blame   because the allegiance of those here is as emotional as it is economic.It means God, guns, patriotism, saying  Merry Christmas  and not Happy Holidays. It means validation of their indignation about a changing nation: gay marriage and immigration and factories moving overseas. It means tearing down the political system that neglected them again and again in favor of the big cities that feel a world away.On those counts, they believe Trump has delivered, even if his promised blue-collar renaissance has not yet materialized. He s punching at all the people who let them down for so long   the presidential embodiment of their own discontent. He s already done enough to get my vote again, without a doubt, no question,  Wes Lewis, a retired pipefitter and one of Whitt s regulars, declares as he deals the day s first hand of cards.He thinks the mines and the factories will soon roar back to life, and if they don t, he believes they would have if Democrats and Republicans and the media   all  crooked as a barrel of fishhooks    had gotten out of the way. What Lewis has now that he didn t have before Trump is a belief that his president is pulling for people like him. One thing I hear in here a lot is that nobody s gonna push him into a corner,  says Whitt, 35.  He s a fighter. I think they like the bluntness of it. He plops down at an empty table next to the card game, drops a stack of mail onto his lap and begins flipping through the envelopes. Bill, bill, bill,  he reports to his wife, Chesla, who has arrived to relieve him at the restaurant they run together. He needs to run home and change of out his Frosty Freeze uniform, the first of several work ensembles he wears each day, and put on his second, a suit and tie. He also owns a local funeral home and he s the county coroner, elected as a Democrat.The Whitts, like many people here, cobble together a living with a couple jobs each   sometimes working 12 or 15 hours a day   because there aren t many options better than minimum wage. There s the school system, and a prison, and that s pretty much it. Outside of town, population 622, roads wind past rolling farms that used to grow tobacco before that industry crumbled too, then up into the hills of Appalachia, with its spectacular natural beauty and grinding poverty that has come to define this region in the American imagination.Whitt slides a medical bill across the table. Looks like this one is the new helmet,  he says, and his wife tears the envelope open and reports the debt: $3,995. They will add it to a growing pile that s already surpassed $40,000 since their son was born nine months ago with a rare condition. His skull was shaped like an egg, the bones fused together in places they shouldn t be. Tommy, their baby boy with big blue eyes, has now outgrown three of the helmets he s been required to wear after surgery so his bones grow back together like they should.They pay $800 a month for insurance. But when they took their baby to a surgeon in Cincinnati, they learned it was out of network. In-network hospitals offered only more invasive surgeries, so they opted to pay out of pocket. At the hospital they were told that if they d been on an insurance program for the poor, it would have all been free.This represents the cracks in America s institutions that drove Whitt, a lifelong Democrat, from supporting President Barack Obama to buying a  Make America Great Again  cap that he still keeps on top of the hutch. Many of their welfare-dependent neighbors, he believes, stay trapped in a cycle of handouts and poverty while hardworking taxpayers like him and his wife are stuck with the tab and can t get ahead. Where s the fairness in that?  he asks.But Whitt doesn t blame Trump for the failure this year to repeal the health care law and replace it with something better. He blames the  brick wall  in Washington, the politicians he sees as blocking everything Trump proposes while  small people  like them in small places like this are left again to languish.A third of people here live in poverty. Just 9 percent of adults have a college degree, but they always made up for that with backbreaking labor that workers traveled dozens of miles to neighboring counties or states to do, and those jobs have gotten harder to find.Many here blame global trade agreements and the  war on coal    environmental regulations designed by Obama s administration to curb carbon emissions   for the decline of mining and manufacturing jobs. When Trump bemoans the  American carnage  of lost factories and lost faith, it feels like he s talking to the people in these Appalachian hills. When he scraps dozens of regulations to the horror of environmentalists and says it means jobs are on the way, they embrace him.Coal has ticked up since Trump took office; mining companies have added 1,200 jobs across the country since his inauguration, more than 180 of them in Kentucky. But industry analysts say that was tied largely to market forces and dismiss Trump s repeated pledges to resuscitate the coal industry as pie in the sky. Coal has been on the decline for many decades for many reasons outside of regulation: far cheaper natural gas, mechanization, thinning Appalachian seams. With the opposition he s had, I think he s pulling the plow pretty good,  offers Wes Lewis from the card table. A few months ago, he says, he saw four brand-new coal rigs going through town.  For the longest time, under Obama, all we saw were trucks being pulled on wreckers, because people turned belly up, they went broke. Lewis says he s heard about friends of friends being called back to work. He s noticed new trucks in people s driveways, too, which he takes as evidence that his neighbors are feeling confident about their futures. These tiny signs stack up to him as proof. Lewis fishes the tag out of the bib of his overalls:  Made in Mexico,  it reads. Trump s bringing them back,  he says.Lewis, a registered Democrat, trusts Trump because he trusts his values. And because of that, he trusts Trump s other promises   so strongly he can t think of anything that would shake that faith in him. If the factories and mines don t come back, he ll blame the opposition. If there isn t a wall on the Mexico border, he says, it won t be because Trump didn t try. If investigators find his campaign colluded with Russians, it s because so many people are so determined to bring him down.Go HERE to read entire story.",0.0
 Newt Gingrich Demands President Obama Pick A Conservative Just Like Scalia For SCOTUS (VIDEO),"Newt Gingrich is hoping President Obama will say  yes sir  and do what white conservatives tell him to do.During an appearance on Fox & Friends on Sunday, the former House Speaker and former Republican presidential wannabe chimed in on the death of Justice Antonin Scalia and whether or not President Obama should be able to nominate a replacement during his final year in office.Of course, picking a nominee is the job of the executive branch as laid out clearly by the Constitution. It is then the job of the Senate to hold hearings and then bring up the nominee for a confirmation vote. That s how this works.But Senate Republicans have already vowed to block any and every nominee President Obama puts forward. And Newt Gingrich s solution is even worse than not having a nominee confirmed at all.When Clayton Morris explained that Democrats expect Senate Republicans to do their Constitutional duty because President Obama was elected to a four year term and not just three, Gingrich said that if President Obama wants to guarantee the confirmation of a nominee he should meet with conservative Senators and let them handpick a conservative like Scalia to be the nominee.In other words, conservatives actually think that since Scalia was a conservative that a like-minded individual should be selected to replace him, thus keeping the Supreme Court a conservative-leaning institution.MORRIS:  Senator Leahy and others have said though this would send the [Supreme] Court into disarray, having four-four and leaving these big decisions to the appellate courts and let these decisions stand for a year. And Democrats also saying, look, President Obama was elected to a four-year term. Americans spoke. He was elected to four years, not three years. He has every right to choose a nominee. GINGRICH:  No, no, no. He has every right to recommend. He doesn t have every right to choose. This goes back to the Constitution. The Senate is not obligated to approve who he recommends. I mean, he has a simple model. If he really wants to get somebody approved, sit down with Mitch McConnell and with conservative senators like Mike Lee, ask them who they would approve and nominate somebody who is in the Scalia tradition. Now, Obama is not going to do that. Obama wants to send up a radical to eliminate the Second Amendment right to bear arms, to eliminate religious liberty, to impose bigger government and more power in Washington. And that s his right. I understand that s what he believes. But the Senate has no obligation to shift this court for the next 30 years radically to the left in the last year of the Obama presidency. Here s the video via Media Matters:However, Gingrich s demand is ridiculous. This is not how the system works. While the truth is that no one really knows how a Supreme Court Justice will rule once they start hearing cases and issuing decisions, the fact is that no president is obligated to replace a dead or retiring Justice with one that has the exact ideological views, nor does the Constitution require such a thing.And if Senate Republicans think that s how it should be, they would be committing a sort of political blackmail to get their own way. The bottom line is that the president picks nominees to the Court and it s the Senate s job to confirm them or not. We all know that if Ruth Bader Ginsburg ever stepped down from the bench during a Republican presidency that she would be replaced immediately with a staunch conservative. Republicans certainly would never entertain the thought of replacing her with an ideological copy in the name of  fairness.  So conservatives like Gingrich should not expect Scalia s replacement to be a nominee of their choosing. President Obama will fulfill his constitutional obligation and whether Senate Republicans like the nominee or not, they must do theirs. America deserves a fully functioning Supreme Court.Featured Image: Wikimedia",0.0
Medicaid cuts coming in Trump budget: Washington Post,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumps budget proposal, set to be unveiled on Tuesday, will include cuts to Medicaid and propose changes to other assistance programs for low-income citizens, the Washington Post reported on Sunday.  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  A Republican healthcare bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives in early May seeks to overhaul the national healthcare system and cut more than $800 billion over the next 10 years from Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled. The healthcare bill faces a difficult time in the Senate, where Democrats and some Republicans worry about its impact on costs for low-income Americans, among other issues. In yet another broken promise to working people, President Trumps budget pulls the rug out from so many who need help, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement, in response to the report. This budget is taking the fast lane to rejection by the American people and both parties in Congress The Post report said the White House would also give individual U.S. states more autonomy over a variety of anti-poverty poverty programs including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the largest U.S. anti-hunger program, which was formerly called the food stamp program.  More than 44 million Americans received benefits from the SNAP program in February, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.     ",1.0
DISRESPECTFUL DEMS EXPOSED! Youll Never Guess Who Also Boycotted George W. Bushs Inauguration [VIDEO],"It s a free country, and the nineteen (and counting) members of Congress who are planning to boycott President-elect Trump s inauguration are certainly within their rights. So even is Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., who said over the weekend that Trump s election (or his presidency) is  illegitimate. That doesn t make his comment true or honorable or helpful to the nation s well-being, but he is free to say it.Reps. Lewis, Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., Barbara Lee, D-Calif., Katherine Clark, D-Mass., and the other inaugural boycotters are certainly not alone in finding Trump uniquely awful. They are not alone in believing the president-elect has gone out of his way to offend people. Probably they also recognize that, in the safe districts they all represent, an inaugural boycott might even be a political winner.But this is also part of a pattern. Lewis and Lee, along with some other Democratic lawmakers at the time, also boycotted to make a point when President George W. Bush was inaugurated in 2001. The Washington Post reported at the time that Lewis  thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush s swearing-in because he doesn t believe Bush is the true elected president. Maybe they had a better excuse that time, as there was so much lingering acrimony surrounding the Florida recount. But we re talking about elected members of Congress who have refused to accept two Republican presidencies in a row. Is there always a good enough excuse whenever a Republican wins? At what point is it fair to ask whether some people are just not committed to democratic or legal processes at all unless the results come out as they hope?

Russian hackers stole U.S. cyber secrets from NSA: media reports,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian government-backed hackers stole highly classified U.S. cyber secrets in 2015 from the National Security Agency after a contractor put information on his home computer, two newspapers reported on Thursday. As reported first by The Wall Street Journal, citing unidentified sources, the theft included information on penetrating foreign computer networks and protecting against cyber attacks and is likely to be viewed as one of the most significant security breaches to date. In a later story, The Washington Post said the employee had worked at the NSA s Tailored Access Operations unit for elite hackers before he was fired in 2015. The NSA declined to comment, citing agency policy  never to comment on our affiliates or personnel issues.  Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports.  If confirmed, the hack would mark the latest in a series of breaches of classified data from the secretive intelligence agency, including the 2013 leaks of data on classified U.S. surveillance programs by contractor Edward Snowden. Another contractor, Harold Martin, is awaiting trial on charges that he took classified NSA material home. The Washington Post reported that Martin was not involved in the newly disclosed case.  Republican U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement responding to the Journal report that, if true, the details were alarming.   The NSA needs to get its head out of the sand and solve its contractor problem,  Sasse said.  Russia is a clear adversary in cyberspace and we can t afford these self-inflicted injuries.  Tensions are already high in Washington over U.S. allegations of a surge in hacking of American targets by Russians, including the targeting of state election agencies and the hacking of Democratic Party computers in a bid to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential election in favor of Republican Donald Trump. Citing unidentified sources, both the Journal and the Post also reported that the contractor used antivirus software from Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab, the company whose products were banned from U.S. government networks last month because of suspicions they help the Kremlin conduct espionage.  Kaspersky Lab has strongly denied those allegations.  Russian government officials could have used flaws in Kaspersky software to hack into the machine in question, security experts told Reuters. They could also have intercepted traffic from the machine to Kaspersky computers. Kaspersky said in a statement on Thursday that it found itself caught in the middle of a geopolitical fight.  Kaspersky Lab has not been provided any evidence substantiating the company s involvement in the alleged incident reported by the Wall Street Journal,  it said.  It is unfortunate that news coverage of unproven claims continue to perpetuate accusations about the company.     The Department of Homeland Security on Sept. 13 banned Kaspersky products in federal networks, and the U.S. Senate approved a bill to ban them from use by the federal government, citing concerns the company may be a pawn of the Kremlin and poses a national security risk.  James Lewis, a cyber expert with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the report of the breach sounded credible, though he did not have firsthand information on what had transpired.   The baffling parts are that he was able to get stuff out of the building and that he was using Kaspersky, despite where he worked,  Lewis said. He said that intelligence agencies have considered Kaspersky products to be a source of risk for years. Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who led calls in Congress to purge Kaspersky Lab products from government networks, on Thursday called on the Trump administration to declassify information about threats posed by Kaspersky Lab.  It s a disservice to the public and our national security to continue withholding this information,  Shaheen said in a statement. ",1.0
 New Poll Is DEVASTATING News For Trump  Its Worse Than His Slipping Approval Rating,"A new Politico/Morning Consult poll is out, and it shows that Trump s approval rating among registered voters is continuing to occupy the dregs of presidential approval ratings. It was conducted during his allegedly successful foreign trip, showing that pretending to be presidential by traveling abroad for conferences and summits didn t serve to impress voters.What s worse (better?), though, is the number of people who want him impeached. That number jumped five points over the last week. One week ago, only 38 percent of voters wanted to see him impeached. Morning Consult s founder and chief researcher, Kyle Dropp, says: If President Trump was hoping his foreign trip would shift the conversation away from scandals, he may be out of luck  Over the last week, support for beginning impeachment proceedings among voters rose from 38 percent to 43 percent. While it s true that most Democrats want to see Trump impeached, and most Republicans don t want to see him impeached, the fact that this number is rising shows just how growing segments of America view Trump as unfit to serve. In fact, of those who want Trump impeached, a majority see Trump as  unfit to serve and should be removed from office, regardless of whether he committed an impeachable offense or not. Trump went to Europe and made complete fools out of us by calling Germany  bad, very bad,  and threatening to cut off German cars, despite the fact that most German cars sold here are built here. He literally shoved Montenegro s prime minister out of his way, he scolded our NATO allies like a bunch of children over something he does not understand, and he s withdrawing us from the Paris climate agreement.Couple that with his ongoing obsession with the media including continuing to call them  the enemy  because they keep calling him out on his stupidity and his lies and his sheer comfort with being a lying ignoramus on the world stage, and yes. He s wholly unfit to serve.Congress probably won t bow to any political pressure on this. Trump s list of impeachable offenses (like obstructing an official investigation a la Richard Nixon) has to be extensive and inexcusable for the GOP-controlled Congress to draw up articles of impeachment. But when they find themselves backed into that corner, they ll have to listen to the growing public outcry this poll demonstrates.Featured image by Aaron P. Bernstein via Getty Images",0.0
Effort to replace Trump on ballot would face tremendous obstacles,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some prominent Republicans are urging Donald Trump to quit as the partys presidential nominee after video surfaced of him making vulgar comments about women but any attempt to replace Trump on the ballot would face huge legal and logistical hurdles. The real estate magnate has insisted he would never give up the White House race and wrote on Twitter on Sunday that Republicans who are attacking him are self-righteous hypocrites.     With only a month to go before the Nov. 8 election against Democrat Hillary Clinton, it would be a massive stretch to substitute Trump for his running mate Mike Pence or anyone else, Republican strategists and U.S. election experts said.     It is virtually impossible to replace somebody in August, let alone October, Republican strategist Karl Rove said on Fox News Sunday.  After a video of Trump making vulgar comments about women surfaced Friday, Republicans such as U.S. Senator Mike Lee of Utah and Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois urged Trump to remove himself from the race. The 2005 video showed Trump, then a reality TV star speaking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. The video was taped only months after Trump married his third wife, Melania.  Making a change at the top of the ticket for one of the two major parties this close to Election Day would be without precedent in the history of modern U.S. presidential elections. In 1972, Democratic presidential candidate George McGoverns running mate, Thomas Eagleton, was replaced after it was revealed that the vice presidential hopeful had been hospitalized for depression. Eagleton withdrew from the race in August of that year and was replaced by Sargent Shriver. In 2000, Missouri voters faced a last-minute candidate change in the states U.S. Senate race after the Democratic challenger Mel Carnahan died in a plane crash, a month before the election. Carnahans name remained on the ballot, however, and the dead man won the election. His widow, Jean Carnahan was appointed to fill the seat.   Republican party rules do not include a mechanism to involuntarily remove from the ticket a presidential candidate who has already been nominated.  The party does have procedure, known as Rule 9, that outlines the process for filling a vacancy if a nominee were to die or quit. Republican leaders could try to pressure Trump into resigning by withdrawing financial support for his campaign and withholding logistical help. But as of Sunday, Trump showed no sign of backing down and went on the attack against party figures who have suggested he leave the race. But if Trump were to decide to quit, the process would involve convening a 160-member committee of the Republican convention to select a new nominee, said Thomas Schwartz, a presidential historian at Vanderbilt University. Experts say such a step would lead to electoral chaos with Republican attorneys fighting state-by-state legal battles to make the last-minute candidate swaps on paper ballots, long after many state deadlines have already passed. Even more daunting, would be how to deal with early or overseas votes already cast. About 411,000 Americans already have voted in person or through the mail, according to Michael P. McDonald, a Florida State University political science professor who tracks early voting. The figure is sure to grow dramatically over the coming days. Early voting has already begun in six states and this week it will start in eight more. Another problem for Republicans is the risk of legal challenges to the election result. Concern about such challenges could deter some Republicans from voting. The Republican Party might argue that those ballots already cast for Trump should count toward electoral votes for the replacement candidate, said Matthew Dallek, an expert on presidential politics at George Washington Universitys Graduate School of Political Management. Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile said the party would likely challenge any effort by Republicans to replace Trump as their candidate on the ballot, adding that it would be very confusing for voters with early ballots already being cast. It would be political suicide for Donald Trump to step down right now, she told ABC News. Im sure my legal team is already looking at efforts underway, if there are any efforts underway, she said when asked if Democrats would oppose any effort by Republicans in the states to switch candidates on ballots. Dallek said an effort to substitute a new candidate at this point would lead to utter chaos. We would be operating in uncharted territory. You would be in this legal netherworld, he said. ",1.0
U.S. Senate tips labor board to Republican majority,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Monday confirmed William Emanuel, a veteran  management-side labor lawyer, to the National Labor Relations Board, giving the agency a Republican majority widely expected to roll back recent decisions that business groups have said favored unions. Emanuel, a partner with global labor-law firm Littler Mendelson, was confirmed 49-47 by the Republican-controlled Senate. President Donald Trump nominated Emanuel and Marvin Kaplan, a lawyer and former Republican congressional aide, to the board earlier this year. Kaplan was confirmed in August. The NLRB oversees union elections and disputes between private-sector employers, workers and unions.  Republicans will now have a 3-2 edge on the board. Business groups and many Republicans lawmakers have called on the agency to revisit significant changes to labor policy adopted during the administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama. They include rules designed to speed up the union election process and a 2015 decision that made it easier for companies to be found to be joint employers and held liable for legal violations by contractors, staffing agencies and franchisees. Emanuel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Before the vote, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  said that during the Obama administration, the board strayed from its role as a neutral umpire in labor disputes. Its time to get back to that important original mission, he said. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said, however, that  Emanuel should not join the NLRB after spending 40 years trying to prevent workers from organizing. Emanuel has worked with Republicans in Congress and trade groups including the National Retail Federation and National Association of Manufacturers, and has defended employers for decades in NLRB cases.  He is a member of the conservative Federalist Society, an influential group of lawyers credited with pushing Trump to nominate Neil Gorsuch to U.S. Supreme Court. At a Senate confirmation hearing in August, several Democrats questioned whether Emanuel would properly consider workers collective bargaining rights after long representing employers and trade groups.  He said he would be honest and objective as a board member, and noted that it would be unusual for a labor lawyer to have experience representing both unions and management. ",1.0
" SURPRISE: The People Behind Fearless Girl Statue Were Cynical, Greedy, Anti-Feminist Men","There were a lot of arguments online after the  Fearless Girl  statue was erected in front of the Wall Street Bull. Many people thought it was a perfect representation of standing up to the male-dominated culture of the financial industry, while others felt like it was just another commercial effort to cash in on the popularity of public companies suddenly growing a conscience and adopting policies that appease  social justice warriors  (also known as decent human beings).Unfortunately, one of those arguments has been proven right.According to the New York Post, the firm behind the statue that went up ostensibly to  promote gender equality,  State Street Corp, was caught underpaying 300 female employees, along with 15 more who were black.After the company was audited by the Department of Labor s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, they promised they would come up with the money, but in the meantime, it just looks bad. The company settled for $5 million, an astounding amount, considering the relatively small number of affected employees.How far will this faux-minism set women back? None. Real feminists don t require icons or court confirmation of oppression.Twitter was similarly unimpressed:Modern feminism sometimes suffers from a lack of explicit examples of sexism.

Noted misogynist and all-around piece of shit James Woods chimed in, of course, although to pick up his subtle dig at feminism requires reading the replies to his tweet   which he was fishing for. A full complement of alt-right Trump trolls joined the party, and anti-feminists everywhere saw the hypocrisy and cynicism of this one company as emblematic of the whole:The Fearless Girl statue is utterly moronic, but it exemplifies the feminist movement.

 Trump Just Closed The Office That Coordinates Russia Sanctions,"With Donald Trump late on implementing the new sanctions against Russia, he knew he had to spring into actions. Did he do his job? No. Did he implement the sanctions like a big boy? Nope. What he did was close the office that coordinates said sanctions. Foreign Policy reports:Secretary of State Rex Tillerson eliminated the Coordinator for Sanctions Policy office, which had been led by a veteran ambassador-rank diplomat with at least five staff, as part of an overhaul of the department, former diplomats and congressional sources told Foreign Policy.Instead, the role of coordinating U.S. sanctions across the State Department and other government agencies now falls to just one mid-level official   David Tessler, the deputy director of the Policy Planning Office. The Policy Planning Office, which previously operated as a small team providing strategic advice to the secretary but did not manage programs or initiatives, has grown in power under Tillerson s  redesign  of the department.While the sanctions office was dissolved, the administration missed a key Oct. 1 deadline to implement new penalties against Russia adopted by Congress in August. The move reinforced concerns among both Democratic and Republican lawmakers that the Trump White House is mismanaging the State Department and undercutting the role of U.S. diplomacy.While the administration had time to create chaos by eliminating the sanctions office, they for some reason could not expend the effort to actually enforce the sanctions, which have been repeatedly condemned by Donald Trump.Interesting stuff, that.Featured image via Getty Images/Alex Wong",0.0
 WATCH: Keith Olbermann RIPS Republicans For Letting Russia Take Over Our Country,"The Russians have wanted a puppet in the White House for decades, and now they have one after successfully helping Donald Trump win the election.Last week, the CIA concluded along with over a dozen other intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election to get Trump elected. Trump refused to acknowledge that Russia meddled. In fact, he has been desperately defending Russia as his legitimacy is increasingly doubted. Republicans have largely sat on their hands because they don t care if a foreign power rigged our election as long as their candidate wins.But now Russia has a measure of control over the United States that they have never had before and that means Vladimir Putin was able to execute a coup in this nation without firing a single shot   and the unwillingness of Trump and Republicans to do anything about it enraged Keith Olbermann, who tore them to shreds for it. We are at war with Russia,  Olbermann began.  Or perhaps more correctly, we have lost a war with Russia without a battle. We are no longer a sovereign nation, we are no longer a democracy, we are no longer a free people, we are the victims of a bloodless coup. Indeed, if Russia and the GOP are allowed to get away with this coup, nothing stops Republicans from seeking help from foreign powers in any election. Democracy would be dead, and our government would no longer be chosen by the people.Olbermann shamed Republicans for not taking Russia s espionage seriously and wondered  if the Russians hacked the RNC and have kept what they found there to make sure Trump and the Republicans obeyed. That would certainly be an explanation for why Republicans have been defending Russia.And that s why Olbermann called for the immediate appointment of a special prosecutor and called for preventing Trump from taking office until we know what Trump knew and when he knew it. After all, Trump did encourage Russia to continue hacking our political process during the campaign. There is no time for a full review or a measured analysis or recommendations to prevent interference in our future elections. Because permitting Donald Trump to assume the office of president reduces the chance that we will have any future elections. The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread, and the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum who are beholden to scum   Russian scum. Trump is already stocking his cabinet with pro-Russia officials, including Putin s personal friend Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State. And because Trump wants to build a hotel in Moscow and owes Russia for getting him elected, it s likely Trump will be beholden to Putin, which means a weaker NATO and a weaker America as Russia grabs for power around the world with no United States to challenge them. It will not be a peaceful change of power   it will be a usurpation,  Olbermann concluded.  And the usurper has no validity, no credibility and no authority under the Constitution. This is a reality, and this will be the only reality until this country rids itself of Donald John Trump. He is not a president   he is a puppet. Here s the video via YouTube:Donald trump and the Republican Party are ignoring Russia s meddling because they won the election. If the situation were reversed and Hillary Clinton has won with Russia s help there is no denying that Republicans would be crying foul right now. So they need to stop being hypocrites and start standing up for the integrity of our election system. They need to keep Trump from taking office and the best way to do that is to get the Electoral College to vote against him. Our nation s future is at stake.Featured image via screenshot",0.0

House leader says willing to do conference committee on healthcare,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday he is willing to go to a conference committee with the Senate if it passes a pared-down version of Obamacare repeal. Ryan said the Senate had made it clear that they did not want their skinny repeal bill, the contents of which are not yet known but was expected to be voted upon on Thursday or Friday, to become law and that the aim of passing the legislation was to keep alive the process of repealing the Affordable Care Act. If a conference committee produces legislation, both the House and Senate will have to vote on it, and Ryan said the burden would fall on the Senate to pass it first.  ",1.0
Britain's Brexit rebels offer compromise on latest EU exit laws row,"LONDON (Reuters) - British MPs who inflicted defeat on Prime Minister Theresa May last week in parliament over Brexit have signalled a possible compromise to avoid another row on Wednesday when legislation taking Britain out of the EU is debated. The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, which will repeal the 1972 legislation binding Britain to the EU and copy existing EU law into domestic law, has tested May s authority to deliver on her Brexit plan during several days of line-by-line debate. Last week, 11 lawmakers from her Conservative Party rebelled against their leader, joining forces with the opposition to force through changes giving parliament greater guarantees of a meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal. However, another row - this time over the government s desire to fix the planned date of Britain s departure into law - could be averted on Wednesday after rebels said they were prepared to agree to it if another proviso were inserted in the bill allowing that date to be changed if necessary. Pro-EU Conservative Nicky Morgan, who voted against the government last week, said on Twitter she would back the plan when it comes to a vote. Some of the other rebels also publicly indicated their support. Last week s defeat underscored just one of the serious difficulties May faces in taking the country out of the EU.  As well as navigating a divided parliament without an overall majority, she has to please ministers who are deeply split over the country s long term relationship with Brussels and negotiate a deal from an EU which is keen to send a discouraging message to other potentially wayward states.   The initial move to define March 29 2019 in law as  exit day  was designed to ease pressure on the government from Brexiteers who fear slow negotiations and opposition to the divorce could cause delays. The government has not confirmed it will accept the compromise plan - which represents a watering-down of its original intention - but has said it will consider its response and remains open to changes that will improve the legislation. However, ministers have limited room to manoeuvre with over 40 Conservative lawmakers signed up to the proposal - more than enough to defeat May if opposition parties also back it.  It would be foolhardy to make assumptions either about the votes of colleagues or about the decisions of government. But I am cautiously optimistic that the government will accept my amendments and that they will carry,  said Oliver Letwin, the former minister responsible for brokering the compromise.  Wednesday s debate is the last in the current stage of the legislating process but the bill will receive further scrutiny in both chambers of parliament over the coming months before it is finally approved.

 Talk Show Host Whines That No One Called George W. Bush My N***a At Correspondents Dinner (VIDEO),"People have called former President George W. Bush lots of things. War criminal. Worst President Ever. Terrorist. Dipshit. F*ckface. But it is doubtful that any African-American man, woman, or child (especially after his response to Hurricane Katrina) would ever call him  my nigga. While Republicans are understandably confused by Larry Wilmore s term of endearment for the President at the Correspondents  Dinner   after all, they are used to calling him the  -er  variation of the word rather than the one Wilmore used   many view Wilmore s ability to infuriate the right in this manner as the only redeeming aspect of his otherwise godawful comedy routine. So, Mr. President, I m going to keep it a hundred. Yo Barry, you did it, my n*gga,  Wilmore said at the dinner, a phrase that most recognized as a positive remark but the Right felt was a reminder of that  n-word  thing they don t get to use when referencing President Obama.Upon hearing Wilmore call the President  my nigga,  Fox host Todd Starnes, for example, nearly exploded into a noxious cloud of rage and envy after hearing Wilmore use a variation of something that he s been screaming inside his head for years as he pretended that Wilmore s words were somehow offensive. Sharing in Starnes  feigned outrage is conservative talk show host and imbecile Jimmy Mathis, who threw an almost temper tantrum on Sunday over Wilmore s ability to use the word.Suddenly, for the first time in his presidency, Mathis feels that Barack Obama deserves  respect.  That s   the jealousy felt by the Stupid Part of America that is so pervasive that they are now talking about  respecting this President   the same one they have been screaming about for years.Mathis said that public figures like Wilmore (and, presumably, Fox News hosts and other noted right-wing icons) should   go above and beyond to try to be as respectful to the individual and the office as possible    a complete departure from what typically happens in conservative media. Mathis whined that no one called President George W. Bush  my nigga : And then you have Larry Wilmore Correct me if I m wrong, I don t remember anybody while roasting [President George Bush] dropped the N-word in the final White House Correspondents Dinner.If I were President Obama, I would have walked off that stage, I would have walked off. No way you re going to disrespect me and the office. This is not a P.C. society thing. I can t imagine standing feet from the President of the United States and saying that,  Mathis said, though like all conservatives it s probably something that is a commonly recurring theme in his dreams.Here s a thought for Mathis: right now, at this very moment in time, the Republican frontrunner is endorsed by the KKK. Until you condemn that, the rest of us   especially people you regularly dismissively call  the blacks  or worse   don t give a damn what you think about a black man saying  my nigga.

U.S. prosecutors probing leak of CIA materials to WikiLeaks: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors in Alexandria, Virginia, have expanded a long-running grand jury investigation into WikiLeaks to include the leak of Central Intelligence Agency documents to the website, a source familiar with the inquiry said. The source, who is familiar with the investigation and requested anonymity to discuss sensitive information, said the probe is focused on who leaked descriptions and technical information on techniques and tools the CIA has used to eavesdrop on intelligence targets to the website. U.S. agencies have made only vague public comments on the latest WikiLeaks disclosures, but security and law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation said in the wake of the leaks that it is focused on whether an intelligence contractor was responsible. At this point, they said, investigators do not think Russia or another foreign government was involved. U.S. officials have confirmed that Alexandria-based prosecutors have been conducting a federal grand jury investigation into WikiLeaks and its sources. Some court documents on elements of the inquiry have been made public.  The U.S. Justice Department declined to comment, as did a spokesman for the CIA, which has not publicly confirmed the authenticity of the material made public by WikiLeaks. The website said the material it published comprised thousands of pages of internal CIA discussions about hacking techniques and the use of popular products such as Apple Inc iPhones; Google Inc Android devices; and Samsung Electronics television sets to spy on people. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said his website would provide technology companies with access to the CIA hacking tools it acquired, enabling the companies to patch software vulnerabilities. ",1.0
Tunisian navy rescues 78 migrants off coast,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia s navy rescued 78 migrants including two girls after their vessel en route to Europe took on water off the coast of Chebba and was stranded for three days, the defense ministry said on Friday.

 Joy Behar Gives GOP A PAINFUL Reality Check On Why She Will NEVER Accept Trump (VIDEO),"Now that former reality television star, serial rapist and all-around scammy businessman Donald Trump has won the election, many of his supporters are arguing that it s time the rest of America moved on and accepted him. However, most of us can t get behind the fact that a racist misogynist is going to be leading the country, and are still speaking out against the president-elect any chance we can get.One of those people is The View s Joy Behar, who gave conservatives the perfect reality check on why she will never stand behind Trump or his hateful rhetoric. On Friday, Behar railed against Trump and the idea that America must now come together under him and forget every awful thing he s said about women and minority groups during his presidential campaign.This discussion came up as The View s hosts were discussing whether or not left-leaning celebrities should perform at Trump s inauguration. When co-host Jedediah Bila argued that even celebrities who don t agree with Trump s message should perform for him, Behar strongly disagreed. Behar brought up the fact that Trump said several divisive, offensive things during his campaign that had a major impact. She said: I do not forget what he said when he was campaigning! He insulted every group! Bila tried to defend Trump, noting that Obama had a hard time winning everyone s acceptance in 2008, but Behar said there was no comparison between a moron like Trump and our great 44th President. Reminding Republicans that they fought Obama every step of his presidency, Behar said: They obstructed him for 8 years, so why do I have to be so nice? The resistance that the GOP is facing in regards to Trump is not only a taste of their own medicine, but it is humanity s reaction to a completely unqualified bigot that has just been given more power than he deserves or knows what to do with.You can watch Behar tear into the GOP below:Featured image via screenshot and Drew Angerer/Getty Images",0.0
 Hillary Brands Bigoted Trump Supporters With Brilliant New Moniker In Fiery Speech,"Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is not mincing words when it comes to the bigotry that runs rampant among Donald Trump supporters. While speaking in New York at a fundrasier focused on LGBTQ issues, Hillary pointed out what we already know: many on the Trump Train are straight up bigots, and there s no way around that fact. She said: You know, just to be grossly generalist, you could put half of Trump s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic   you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up. Hillary then went on to make sure that people knew that she understands that not all of Trump s supporters are like this; in fact likely many are disturbed by many of his statements and the behavior of some of their fellow Trump supporters, and they are likely just desperate for change and have been duped into believing Trump can deliver it. She continued: That other basket of people are people who feel that the government has let them down, the economy has let them down, nobody cares about them, nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures, and they re just desperate for a change,  she said.  They don t buy everything he says, but he seems to hold out some hope that their lives will be different. They won t wake up and see their jobs disappear, lose a kid to heroin, feel like they re in a dead end. Those are people we have to understand and empathize with as well. She also added that if you know folks who might vote for Trump, do something about it: If you know anybody who s even thinking of voting for Trump, stage an intervention. Hillary is right, of course. Donald Trump is a demagogue, and this is how demagogues work. They prey on the desperate, they exploit and magnify divisions, all for their own gain of political power. Trump is in no way fit to be president, and his very candidacy is already endangering the country. To that end, we need to listen to Hillary, get out the vote, and make sure she wins, for the future of our own lives and this great nation that we all love.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",0.0
Companies have up to a year for new U.S. tax bill reporting: SEC,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. financial regulators said on Friday that because the new tax bill could make timely financial reporting difficult, public companies can make reasonable estimates when uncertain of the impact of the new tax law in financial reports, and will have up to a year to report final numbers.               The Securities and Exchange Commission bulletin comes after the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned on Thursday that some U.S. listed companies may struggle to file their annual financial reports on time because the Republican-led overhaul of the countrys tax system may prompt a raft of additional disclosures. In a statement on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TJCA) issued on Friday, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and Commissioners Kara Stein and Michael Piwowar said guidance was similar to that given in the past when tax law changes affected financial reporting. The $1.5 trillion tax bill, signed into law on Friday by U.S. President Donald Trump, will significantly affect many companies year-end financial statements because listing rules oblige them to flag any potential material risks or changes to their operations and financial outlook to shareholders. The bill significantly lowers the income tax rate for U.S. companies - to 21 percent from 35 percent - allows them to repatriate cash from overseas, and modifies numerous deductions, among other changes.  Public companies have been given a measurement period to study the changes created by a new law. During the measurement period, the SEC expects companies to complete their accounting and that in no circumstances should the measurement period extend beyond one year from the enactment date, of the TJCA. Companies will also need to make disclosures during the measurement period, including any updates to provisional amounts given earlier, or newly discovered reporting implications from tax bill. For companies with fiscal years ending Dec. 31, getting the necessary analysis done in time could be tough, the Chamber said. The tax bill It is the largest such overhaul since the 1980. In addition to slashing the corporate rate, it temporarily reduces the tax burden for most individuals.     ",1.0
Late UK PM Heath had questions to answer over child sex abuse claims -police,"SWINDON, England (Reuters) - Former British prime minister Edward Heath would have been questioned about claims he sexually abused boys if he were alive today, police said on Thursday after a two-year investigation into the allegations. Supporters of Heath, who never married, have said the investigation was an expensive, flawed witch-hunt.  Heath, who was prime minister from 1970 to 1974 and died 12 years ago, would have been interviewed under caution over seven allegations including raping an 11-year-old boy and indecently assaulting men and other boys, one aged 10. The alleged incidents occurred from 1956 to 1992 while he was a member of Parliament but not prime minister, said Wiltshire Police, the force in western England which headed the national investigation named Operation Conifer.  I am satisfied there were compelling and obvious reasons to investigate allegations made against Sir Edward Heath,  Wiltshire Chief Constable Mike Veale told reporters, adding the report did not suggest or conclude guilt.  The allegations against him were of the utmost seriousness and from a significant number of people. It would be an indefensible dereliction of my public duty as a chief constable not to have investigated such serious allegations against a former prime minister, even though he is deceased.  In total, 40 individuals came forward with accusations against Heath. Of these, evidence undermining the claims were found in 19 cases and three accusers later concluded they were mistaken in naming the ex-prime minister. But Heath would have been quizzed over seven accusations, although police refused to say whether there was other corroborating evidence. The first occurred in 1961 when Heath, who then had the title  Lord Privy Seal , is alleged to have raped and indecently assaulted a boy  during a paid sexual encounter in a private dwelling .  Other claims also related to  paid encounters , including one when he was trade minister, as well as during chance meetings. Paul Mills, the officer who led the investigation, said no accusations had been made against Heath while he was alive and there had been no missed opportunities by police.  Heath became prime minister in 1970 and most notably negotiated Britain s entry into the European Economic Community, which later became the European Union. He was ousted from office in 1974 when he lost two elections after a miners  strike helped bring down the government. He then lost the Conservative party leadership in 1975 to Margaret Thatcher, whom he never forgave and repeatedly criticized in what detractors described as  the longest sulk in history . He remained a lawmaker until 2001 and four years later  aged 89. An artillery officer in World War Two, Heath was very private and was widely regarded as an awkward, prickly man with little gift for small talk. He was passionate about music and sailing, owning five racing yachts named Morning Cloud, and once winning the Sydney-to-Hobart race.  Heath s godson, artist Lincoln Seligman, said the 1.5 million pound ($2 million) police investigation had cast a stain on a man who could not defend himself.  If allegations are out there he might easily have been called in for questioning,  he told BBC radio.  So, yes, they had to question him, but that tells us nothing.  In a joint statement, Robert Armstrong, Heath s former Cabinet secretary, and David Hunt, chairman of the Sir Edward Heath Charitable Foundation, said there should be a judge-led review of the evidence. They called the police report  highly unsatisfactory .  All those who knew Sir Edward Heath or worked with him are, without exception, convinced that the allegations of child abuse will all be found to be groundless,  they said. Britain has been jolted by a series of high-profile child abuse scandals in recent years. The most notable involved the late TV and radio presenter Jimmy Savile. A five-year public inquiry is now looking into whether powerful figures in politics, churches, or local government helped hide abuses. ",1.0

We are taught to embrace humility and diversity. We can understand why, in seeking America s highest office, you have used your degree from Wharton to promote and lend legitimacy to your candidacy.As a candidate for President, and now as the presumptive GOP nominee, you have been afforded a transformative opportunity to be a leader on national and international stages and to make the Wharton community even prouder of our school and values.However, we have been deeply disappointed in your candidacy.We, proud students, alumni, and faculty of Wharton, are outraged that an affiliation with our school is being used to legitimize prejudice and intolerance. Although we do not aim to make any political endorsements with this letter, we do express our unequivocal stance against the xenophobia, sexism, racism, and other forms of bigotry that you have actively and implicitly endorsed in your campaign. The Wharton community is a diverse community. We are immigrants and children of immigrants, people of color, Muslims, Jews, women, people living with or caring for those with disabilities, and members of the LGBTQ community. In other words, we represent the groups that you have repeatedly denigrated, as well as their steadfast friends, family, and allies.We recognize that we are fortunate to be educated at Wharton, and we are committed to using our opportunity to make America and the world a better place for everyone. We are dedicated to promoting inclusion not only because diversity and tolerance have been repeatedly proven to be valuable assets to any organization s performance, but also because we believe in mutual respect and human dignity as deeply held values. Your insistence on exclusion and scapegoating would be bad for business and bad for the American economy. An intolerant America is a less productive, less innovative, and less competitive America.We, the undersigned Wharton students, alumni, and faculty, unequivocally reject the use of your education at Wharton as a platform for promoting prejudice and intolerance. Your discriminatory statements are incompatible with the values that we are taught and we teach at Wharton, and we express our unwavering commitment to an open and inclusive American society.In addition, the authors of the letter spoke to NBC about their decision to write it. It was important for us to speak out against Trump because, as we have seen in many moments throughout history, silence is an act of complicity. This open letter speaks on behalf of Wharton students, alumni and faculty who wish to speak out against hate and stand in solidarity with all members of our diverse community   both at Wharton and across America. In short, Donald Trump just received a giant middle finger from the school and it s a safe bet that past faculty regret that he was ever allowed to step foot in their classrooms. Because every time Trump opens his mouth he makes it hard to believe that he could have ever actually earned a degree anywhere in the first place.Featured Image: Mark Lyons/Getty Images",0.0
 WATCH: Fox SCRAMBLES To Refute Wiretapping Claim After Trump Throws Them Under The Bus,"Fox News found themselves in a really uncomfortable position on Friday because of Donald Trump s gullibility.During a Fox News broadcast on Tuesday, Andrew Napolitano attempted to defend Trump s continuing insistence that President Obama wiretapped him by accusing the British intelligence agency GCHQ of wiretapping Trump after being ordered to do so by Obama.Just like Trump s original accusation, Napolitano s accusation was just as wild and baseless. Yet, White House mouthpiece Sean Spicer repeated it as gospel without providing any evidence to back up the claim.In a rare statement issued by the GCHQ, the agency angrily refuted the accusation. Recent allegations made by media commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano about GCHQ being asked to conduct  wiretapping  against the then president-elect are nonsense. They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored. The international incident reportedly forced Spicer and National Security Adviser McMaster to issue a formal apology to the United Kingdom, even though Spicer and Trump have not publicly backed away from the accusation in the United States.The embarrassing incident was rightfully brought up by reporters during a joint press conference on Friday attended by Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.When asked if the White House made a mistake blaming the British, Trump literally blamed his favorite propaganda network for the an accusation his team repeated, thus throwing them under the bus. Trump also had the audacity to claim his team made no such allegation even though his team openly repeated it as if it somehow proved Trump s original accusation. We said nothing,  Trump said.  All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. That was a statement made by a very talented lawyer on Fox. So you shouldn t be talking to me, you should be talking to Fox. Here s the video via Twitter.Wow. Trump to Merkel about alleged wiretapping by Obama:  At least we have something in common, perhaps.  She appears to be very confused. pic.twitter.com/la4p9ZJGvo  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 17, 2017Almost immediately, Fox News rushed to reverse the damage as anchor Shep Smith told the world that Napolitano was full of shit. Fox News cannot confirm Judge Napolitano s commentary,  Smith said.  Fox News knows of no evidence of any kind that the now-President of the United States was surveilled at any time in any way. Full stop. And then Fox anchor Bret Baier chimed in later in the day by repeating that Napolitano s claim cannot be confirmed. We love the judge, we love him here at Fox, but the Fox News division was never able to back up those claims and was never reported on this show,  Baier reported.While Napolitano was irresponsible for pitching such an accusation, Donald Trump was even more irresponsible by letting Spicer repeat it without any verification of the accuracy of the claim. All Trump had to do is direct his team to make contact with British intelligence and ask if the claim is true or not. But Trump failed to do so because he is flailing for anything that could even suggest in the slightest that his accusation against President Obama is true. But the accusation is clearly false because if Trump really had any proof he would have released it by now. Even Republican leaders in Congress have confirmed that Trump s claim is a lie.So it looks like the honeymoon may be over between Trump and Fox News. It s probably safe to say that Fox News will put a leash on what their commentators say about Trump s wiretapping fiasco. Now we just have to wait and see if Fox News starts to turn on Trump.Featured Image: Scott Olson/Getty Images",0.0
Myanmar military appoints general to probe mass grave in Rakhine state,"YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar s army said on Wednesday that it had appointed a senior officer to investigate whether any members of the security forces were involved in the killing of 10 people whose bodies have been uncovered in a mass grave in Rakhine State. A violent crackdown by the security forces in response to attacks by militants in the western state has caused around 650,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh in recent months. The discover of the grave, at the village of Inn Din, about 50 km (30 miles) north of the state capital Sittwe, was announced by the military two days ago. In a statement posted on the Facebook page of the military s commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the army said a five-member investigation team had left the capital Naypyitaw on Wednesday. The team, led by Lieutenant General Aye Win, would  investigate whether the security forces took part or not, in relation to the unidentified dead bodies found in Inn Din village graveyard . It gave no further details and military officials were not immediately available for comment. General Aye Win is the same officer who led a wider probe into the conduct of troops in a conflict that began in late August, which concluded in a report last month that no atrocities took place. Myanmar s armed forces launched what they termed clearance operations in northern Rakhine, where many of the stateless Muslim minority lived, after Rohingya militants attacked 30 police posts and an army base on Aug. 25. Rights monitors have accused troops of abuses, including killings, mass rape and arson during those operations. The United States has said it amounted to  ethnic cleansing . Myanmar s civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has faced fierce international criticism for failing to do more to protect the Rohingya. The civilian government, which has no control over the military, has said the army was engaged in legitimate counter-insurgency operations. It has promised to investigate allegations of abuses in Rakhine if it is given evidence. ",1.0
HILLARYS NEW AMERICA: Uniformed Police Officers NOT ALLOWED On DNC Floor [VIDEO],"Meanwhile, police officers were outside the walls of the DNC literally putting out fires started by Bernie s flag burners and protecting the very people who mock and scorn them inside. Unimaginable hate, and violence was directed at the same police officers who have been treated like the enemy of the DNC on the streets and outside of the enormous fence erected by the DNC to keep legal citizens out. This is Hillary s America. It s the same America Obama has worked tirelessly to create. Is this the America we want to leave to our children and grandchildren? Thursday on Fox News Channel s  Fox & Friends,  in an appearance from the site of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani called the convention  the most anti-police  and  the most anti-law enforcement  he had ever seen.However, he also said that according to  high-ranking police officers  in Philadelphia, uniformed law enforcement was not allowed on the floor of the convention.WATCH:Rudy Giuliani: Last night was the Democrat insider fantasy land, they didn't talk about one world problemhttps://t.co/6DhXRBrG50  FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) July 28, 2016Via: Breitbart NewsRudy Giuliani: This is the most anti-police, anti-law enforcement convention I've ever seen in my whole life.https://t.co/sHnZAAE430  FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) July 28, 2016",0.0
WHY ROY MOORES ELECTION WIN Is Critical For President Trump To Replace Leftist Federal and U.S. Supreme Court Activist Judges,"Tomorrow, Alabama residents (including thousands of felons who have been registered by Al Sharpton s alleged brother) will go to the polls to decide who they want to represent them in the US Senate. The Democrats have contributed over $10 million to their leftist, virtually unknown candidate, Doug Jones. So, why are they so eager to take this Senate seat?In June 2017, the Democrats spent an astounding $30 million in Georgia s 6th congressional district, to lose a House seat in a special election. They falsely believed that the only thing they needed for Democrat candidate John Ossoff to win the race, was enough Georgians who hated Donald Trump to come out and vote.Is history repeating itself in Alabama?Democrat Senate candidate Doug Jones raised nearly six times Moore s amount ahead of the Dec. 12 special election to fill the Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Jones headed into the final weeks of the race with roughly four times as much money in the bank than his GOP opponent.Jones raked in nearly $10.2 million compared to Jones  $1.8 million. Jones also spent roughly 5 times as much as Moore during that period, nearly $8.7 million compared to Moore s $1.7 million.Conservative Pat Buchanan asks,  Why would Christian conservatives in good conscience go to the polls Dec. 12 and vote for Judge Roy Moore, despite the charges of sexual misconduct with teenagers leveled against him? Answer: That Alabama Senate race could determine whether Roe v. Wade is overturned. The lives of millions of unborn may be the stakes.There is, however, so much more at stake than the single issue of abortion in this hotly contested Senate race. Democrats are not going to sit back and allow President Trump a pathway to remaking the radical leftist judicial system they ve worked so hard to put in place. Today, the GOP, holding Congress and the White House, has a narrow path to capture the Third Branch, the Supreme Court, and to dominate the federal courts for a decade. For this historic opportunity, the party can thank two senators, one retired, the other still sitting.The first is former Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada.In 2013, Harry exercised the  nuclear option,  abolishing the filibuster for President Obama s judicial nominees. The Senate no longer needed 60 votes to confirm judges. Fifty-one Senate votes could cut off debate, and confirm.Iowa s Chuck Grassley warned Harry against stripping the minority of its filibuster power. Such a move may come back to bite you, he told Harry. Grassley is now judiciary committee chairman.And this year a GOP Senate voted to use the nuclear option to shut down a filibuster of Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, who was then confirmed with 55 votes.Yet the Democratic minority still had one card to play to block President Trump s nominees   the  blue slip courtesy. If a senator from the state where a federal judicial nominee resides asks for a hold on proceedings, by not returning a blue slip, the judiciary committee has traditionally honored that request and not held hearings.Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota used the blue slip to block the Trump nomination of David Stras of Minnesota to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Franken calls Stras too ideological, too conservative.But Grassley has now decided to reject the blue slip courtesy for appellate court judges, since their jurisdiction is not just over a single state like Minnesota, but over an entire region.Not only are the federal court vacancies almost unprecedented, a GOP Senate and Trump are working in harness to fill them before January 2019, when a new Congress is sworn in.If Republicans blow this opportunity, it is unlikely to come again. For the Supreme Court has seemed within Republican grasp before, only to have it slip away because of presidential errors.Both Trump, by whom he nominates, and a Republican Senate, with its power to confirm with 51 votes, are indispensable if we are to end judicial dictatorship in America.

"PRESIDENT TRUMP Blasts Phony Climate Change Crybabies: I Was Elected to Represent the Citizens of Pittsburgh, Not Paris [VIDEO]","With his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, President Trump just gave the #ResistTrump crowd a new reason to hate him. Meanwhile, his supporters can add another check mark in the  promised kept  category. We all know how rare it is for a politician to actually do what he promised he d do while campaigning for office. Now it s up to Trump supporters to make sure they have his back President Trump said he was elected to represent the citizens of  Pittsburgh, not Paris,  during remarks Thursday explaining his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. We want fair treatment for our taxpayers,  he said.  We don t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore, and they won t be. They won t be. I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. Trump appeared to name-drop Pittsburgh because of its historic ties to the coal and manufacturing industries.However, Democratic Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto rejected Trump s words, saying his city would follow the guidelines of the agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

Top court exempts church-affiliated hospitals from pension law,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday ruled that church-affiliated hospital systems do not have to comply with a federal law governing employee pensions, overturning lower court decisions that could have cost the hospitals billions of dollars.  The court ruled 8-0 that church-affiliated organizations are exempt from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, a 1974 law that forces private employers to follow rules aimed at protecting pension plan participants.  The ruling was a victory for New Jersey-based Saint Peters Healthcare System, Illinois-based Advocate Health Care Network and California-based Dignity Health, which had faced separate employee lawsuits accusing them of wrongly claiming a religious exemption under ERISA. Federal agencies had long interpreted the law as exempting not just church plans but also those of church-affiliated organizations.  The employees challenged that view, in effect accusing the hospital systems of being big businesses posing as church organizations in order to avoid minimum funding and reporting requirements under ERISA. The three hospital systems maintained that their religious affiliation made them exempt from ERISA. St. Peters is affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church. Dignity operates both Catholic and non-Catholic hospitals. Advocate is affiliated with the United Church of Christ and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Writing for the court, Justice Elena Kagan said the laws religious exemption applies to plans whether they were established by churches themselves or organizations affiliated with the churches.  Justice Sonia Sotomayor agreed with the ruling based on the text of the law. But, in a separate opinion, she wrote that she was troubled with the outcome, noting that some church-affiliated organizations operate for-profit subsidiaries, earn billions of dollars in revenues and compete with companies that must comply with ERISA.  Sotomayor suggested that the U.S. Congress take action, adding that scores of employees - who work for organizations that look and operate much like secular businesses - potentially might be denied ERISAs protections. The ruling is the latest in which the justices endorsed the idea that certain businesses deserve wider latitude because of religious considerations. In 2014, the justices sided with Hobby Lobby, a retailer owned by conservative Christians, that objected to a federal requirement that it pay for insurance coverage for womens birth control, saying that violated a U.S. law protecting religious freedom.  Three separate regional federal appeals courts had ruled against Saint Peters, Advocate and Dignity in separate cases, refusing to dismiss employees lawsuits against them.  Hundreds of hospitals and hospital systems have claimed the exemption since 1980, when Congress amended ERISA to extend what is known as the church plan exemption, originally only for churches, more broadly to certain religiously affiliated entities.  The plaintiffs were seeking retroactive penalties for past violations of ERISA, which the hospitals said could add up to hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. Justice Neil Gorsuch, who joined the court after the arguments were presented in the case, did not participate in Mondays decision. ",1.0
LOL! RADIO STATION HOSTS Car Wash For VeteransUses NFL Jerseys To Wash Cars,"An online radio station based out of Oklahoma gave veterans free car washes with the NFL treatment on Saturday. Volunteers at the event used NFL jerseys and other sports gear to wash down veterans  vehicles for three hours as a response to NFL players protesting the national anthem before games. We met some great people, heard some wonderful stories from the veterans and their spouses,  Blake Wolney, owner of the rock station Bladerunner Radio, told KOCO in an email.Wolney said that radio station employees came up with the idea after thinking about how to create an event that would help people in need and start a trend on social media. We started off with the idea of doing an ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, and we thought we ll take a bunch of NFL gear and destroy it and start it on fire and burn and donate money to veterans, like they do with ALS,  Wolney said Friday.  And then we thought, you know, there s so much negativity and animosity the way it is. Instead of burning the merchandise, they came up with the idea of using NFL jerseys and other accessories to wash cars. Breitbart",0.0
Austrian finance minister says will not serve in new government,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian Finance Minister Hans Joerg Schelling said on Thursday he would not serve in the next coalition government being put together by the leader of his conservative party, Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz. Schelling, 63, had for months said he hoped to retain the finance portfolio and had at one point even suggested other countries wanted him to become the next head of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers. But Kurz, who is just 31, and his party won last month s parliamentary election on a platform of change, despite already being in government, and Schelling s chances of remaining in his post were seen as slim.     After it became clear this week that Schelling was not in the running for the European post, the former furniture executive said he would step down from the position he has held for more than three years, though he would stay on until the next government is formed.  I am leaving politics altogether,  Schelling said in a statement.  The reasons for my decision are many, but I would like to maintain my business-like style and therefore not comment further on my decision.  It is unclear who will succeed Schelling, a relatively orthodox conservative who often joked that he was one of his country s longer-serving finance ministers of recent years. Kurz is in coalition talks with the far-right Freedom Party that he aims to wrap up before Christmas after his party won last month s parliamentary election. ",1.0
Obama administration to announce efforts to boost self-driving cars,"DETROIT (Reuters) - The Obama administration will announce efforts to boost self-driving cars on Thursday, according to government officials. Mark Rosekind, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, told reporters that Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx will be in Detroit to talk about administration efforts to speed the introduction of self-driving vehicles.  There is not yet a clear legal framework governing the presence of driverless cars on U.S. roads.  Automakers and technology companies such as Alphabet Incs Google have called on regulators to clarify guidelines for introduction of autonomous driving technology, in part out of concern that a mishap involving a self-driving car could result in costly litigation. A Google spokesman said the company will take part in Thursdays announcement by Foxx. Detroit automakers are also likely to participate.  In December, Rosekind said he opposed a patchwork of state regulations on driverless cars and promised a nimble, flexible approach to writing new rules for self-driving vehicles. Officials had said President Barack Obama might discuss advanced transportation efforts in his final State of the Union Address on Tuesday, but he did not. ",1.0
Lebanon's Aoun says PM Hariri's freedom restricted in Riyadh,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese President Michel Aoun said on Sunday that Saad al-Hariri s freedom was being restricted in Riyadh, the first time the Lebanese government has publicly declared its belief that Saudi Arabia is holding its prime minister against his will.  Aoun said Hariri was living in  mysterious circumstances  in Riyadh which had  reached the degree of restricting (his) freedom  and  imposing conditions on his residency and on contact with him even by members of his family . Reuters cited senior Lebanese government officials on Thursday saying that the authorities believed Hariri was being held against his will in Riyadh, where he unexpectedly resigned as prime minister on Nov. 4, the day after arriving there. Aoun said this threw doubt over anything that Hariri has said, or will say, and his statements could not be considered as an expression of his full free will. Hariri is expected to give a televised interview later on Sunday. Saudi Arabia has denied Hariri is being held against his will or that he had been forced to resign.  ",1.0

RADICAL LEFTIST WHO DISMISSED CHARGES AGAINST MUSLIM TERRORIST SHOOTER IS POTENTIAL SUPREME COURT NOMINEE,"We re not sure which of Judge Mary Murguia s qualifications for becoming a U.S. Supreme Court Justice would be more attractive to Obama. Could it be the fact that she, like Barack Obama can claim she is responsible for dismissing charges against a terrorist?  Perhaps her it s her sister s connection as a leader of La Raza, a government funded, radical activist group fighting to defend amnesty in America. Knowing Barry, it s likely both.The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals judge who previously dismissed terror charges against one of the Garland, Texas shooters has a connection to the controversial activist group, National Council of La Raza.Judge Mary Murguia, appointed by President Clinton and considered a potential nominee to the Supreme Court by President Obama, was the judge who dismissed government charges against Elton Simpson for suspected terrorism in 2011. On Sunday, Simpson attacked a free speech event in Garland, Texas depicting the Prophet Muhammad in cartoons.Daniel Greenfield cites evidence from the 2011 case:The FBI knew that Elton Simpson, one of the Garland Jihadists, was a threat and had attempted to lock him up after amassing evidence that he intended to go to Somalia as a terrorist. They had him on tape stating  that Allah loves an individual who is  out there fighting [non-Muslims]  and  If you get shot, or you get killed, it s [heaven] straight away.  Mr. Simpson then said  [Heaven] that s what we here for so why not take that route? Judge Murguia held then that the government was unable to prove Simpson mentioned violent jihad in his reasoning for traveling to Somalia.  That phrase is one made up by the Government, likely because it is aware that jihad in the Muslim religion does not necessarily imply violence,  she said, noted Greenfield.However, the LA Times previously noted that Judge Murguria s twin sister Janet Murguia leads a controversial group known as National Council of La Raza, which has been criticized as a racist hate group. It is the nation s largest Latino civil rights activist organization. La Raza is closely linked to the Obama Administration s amnesty efforts.Human Events, a conservative blog, previously reported that the mainstream media views La Raza  no more than a Hispanic Rotary Club.  But La Raza collected roughly $15.2 million in federal grants in 2005. Human Events also reported that undisclosed amounts of that money were used in  get-out-the-vote efforts supporting La Raza political positions. La Raza has been added to congressional hearings and  an anonymous senator even gave the Council of La Raza an extra $4 million in earmarked taxpayer money, supposedly for  housing reform,  according to Human Events. Moreover, Judge Murguria s brother, Carlos Murguria, helped coordinate the Immigration Amnesty Program prior to Clinton nominating him also for a judgeship, according to Front Page Magazine.Via: Bretibart News",0.0

BREAKING NEWS: Proof Obama LIED To Press.Was Notified 6 Different Times That Hillary Changed Email Address [VIDEO],"The most  transparent administration in history  will go down in history as the most corrupt President Obama only learned of Hillary Clinton s private email address use for official State Department business after a New York Times report, he told CBS News in an interview.CBS News senior White House correspondent Bill Plante asked Mr. Obama when he learned about her private email system after his Saturday appearance in Selma, Alabama. The same time everybody else learned it through news reports,  the president told Plante.Mr. Obama s comments follow a long week of media scrutiny surrounding Hillary Clinton s private email address and the  home-brewed  server that hosted it. The policy of my administration is to encourage transparency, which is why my emails, the BlackBerry I carry around, all those records are available and archived,  Mr. Obama said.  I m glad that Hillary s instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed. Despite widespread criticism from Republicans who believe Clinton acted inappropriately, the president continued to defend his former Cabinet member s record. Let me just say that Hillary Clinton is and has been an outstanding public servant. She was a great secretary of state for me,  Mr. Obama said.Watch here:The president reiterated his support of these actions.

"Trump, on possible DACA deal, says border wall would come later","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that any possible deal on immigration with Democrats would have to include provisions for massive border security, and that his planned wall along the border with the Mexico would come later. Trump was asked by reporters about a possible deal with Democrats over immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. He has ordered the disbanding of a program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), that allowed such young adults to stay, but has given Congress six months to come up with an alternative plan.

"Factbox: Quick action Trump could take on energy, environment, climate","(Reuters) - Donald Trump, a big supporter of the U.S. oil, gas and coal industries, has promised to get to work quickly after being sworn in as president of the United States, raising expectations that he will sign a slew of executive orders. Here are some of the executive actions and other maneuvers that could come quickly, related to energy, the environment and climate change: Trump, a Republican, has promised to kill Democratic predecessor Barack Obamas Clean Power Plan, which requires states to cut carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. He has a few options to do so, some simpler than others. The plan is being challenged by 27 of the 50 states in court, so one option is to order the Justice Department to stop defending it  effectively giving the plaintiffs a win. Trump could also seek a voluntary remand asking the court to send the rule back to the Environmental Protection Agency for review. The problem is that attorneys general from states like New York and California, as well as environmental groups, would likely step into the gap and defend the rule. Another possibility would be to order the EPA not to enforce the rule. That, too, could open the door to lawsuits.  A third option would be for Trumps administration to try to issue a new regulation withdrawing the Clean Power Plan, even if it is upheld in the courts, according to the American Energy Alliance, an industry group that helped advise Trumps energy transition team. That move may not be a fast one. The Clean Power Plan, finalized in 2015, was the centerpiece of Obamas broader climate change strategy. The Waters of the U.S. rule, which seeks to clarify which waterways fall under federal environmental protection, has been mentioned repeatedly by Trump as a regulation he hopes to overturn. The rule is also being challenged in court. Legal experts say Trumps options here are similar, and one of the most elegant ways to overturn the rule would be through a voluntary remand, a legal vehicle that would ask the court to return the rule to the EPA for review. That would then give Trumps administration the ability to kill or revise the rule, but could also draw some lawsuits from Democratic attorneys general and environmental groups that want the rule preserved.  Trump has promised to ask TransCanada Corp (TRP.TO) to resubmit its application to build the Keystone XL pipeline, a project to pipe more Canadian oil sands crude into the United States that was rejected by the Obama administration after years of environmental lobbying against it. While the invitation to resubmit could come quickly, it is unclear whether TransCanada would seek to revive the project given that oil prices are far lower now than they were when the company initially pursued it.  Trump may also seek to issue an order to undo a guidance issued last August by the White House Council on Environmental Quality that requires federal agencies to quantify greenhouse gas emissions and factor in impacts on climate change while evaluating projects like pipelines. The council had updated the decades-old National Environmental Policy Act to include the greenhouse gas update. Trump could sign an executive order approving the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, or order the acting secretary of the army to approve the project, according to Brigham McCown, former head of the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration under President George W. Bush. However, such a move would be highly unpopular among pipeline opponents who have camped out at the construction site for months. Leaders from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which led the protests over worries the pipeline would threaten water quality, have vowed to challenge any executive action. The pipeline is owned by Energy Transfer Partners LP (ETP.N).  One little-known tool used by the Obama administration to support its regulations curbing carbon emissions is the Social Cost of Carbon, a calculation made by a panel of technical experts to place a dollar value on the public harm caused by carbon dioxide emissions. The calculation is used in the rule-making cost/benefit analysis.  The current cost of carbon is put at $36 per tonne, which will rise to $50 by 2030. The American Energy Alliance believes that Trump could immediately order government agencies to end the use of the Social Cost of Carbon, which could help it unravel a number of Obamas other anti-carbon regulations. Trump could immediately lift the Department of Interiors moratorium on coal leasing on federal land, which the department enacted last year as it sought to review the program and evaluate whether the government adequately priced the value of coal extracted from public land on behalf of the taxpayer. Lifting the moratorium would improve industry access to vast coal deposits remaining in the Powder River Basin. Reversing some of Obamas more recent moves to put federal acreage off limits to drilling could be more complicated. Obama designated around 1.6 million acres of federal lands in Utah and Nevada as monuments, using a tough-to-overturn law called the Antiquities Act. He also permanently protected areas of the offshore Arctic and Atlantic using another law that legal experts say would be a challenge to overturn. The Obama administration finalized a couple of environmental regulations in its last weeks in office that are likely to be quickly overturned, including the Bureau of Land Management Methane Rule and the Streams Protection Act. Congressional leaders said they would target those rules under the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to use a simple majority vote to rescind a regulation within 60 legislative days of publication.  The methane rule limits methane emissions from energy installations on federal land, while the Streams Protection Act protects waterways from coal mining runoff. Some other rules, affecting the agriculture industry, could also fit in this category. They include the U.S. Department of Agricultures final rule regarding production requirements for organic livestock and poultry, establishing minimum indoor and outdoor space requirements for chickens. During his campaign for the White House, Trump said he would pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement within 100 days of taking office. The accord, signed by nearly 200 countries last year, is intended to curb global warming by slashing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Since his November election, Trump has softened his stance slightly, telling The New York Times he would keep an open mind about the deal. Nonetheless, the former New York businessman has been advised by his team about swift options he could take to end U.S. participation in the accord, including issuing a presidential order simply deleting the U.S. signature from the accord.

NATIONAL SECURITY FOR SALE: UNIVISION Chair Gives Hillary $7 Million To Keep Borders Open,"Trump has the Left scrambling to figure out how they re going to stop the flow of illegal immigrants future Democrat voters into America. The possibility that he will defeat Hillary in a landslide election is becoming more and more real every day The chairman of the huge media company Univision has coughed up $7 million to support Hillary Clinton, according to a report on the biggest donors to her presidential campaign.Haim Saban and his wife, described as  liberal mega  donors, are the Democratic front-runner s top donors, according to the campaign database OpenSecrets.org and its reporter Will Tucker.Saban is notable inside the Donald Trump campaign for canceling coverage of Trump s Miss USA pageant on the Spanish-language network after the Republican proposed a wall between the countries.Tucker revealed the information on Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson, which will air Sunday on Sinclair stations and online.By comparison, Trump s top donor gave $150,000, said the report.From the show s transcript, provided in advance to Secrets:Attkisson:  Would people be surprised to know what s really going on behind some of these campaigns? Tucker:  I think they would. And I think the data that we work with every day reflects kind of what people fear about the political system. It reflects that very few people have an outside influence over the federal political system in the United States. Tucker also found that Wall Street is Clinton s top donor.Below is the information and fuller transcript provided by Attkisson s show:Sharyl Attkisson:  Who are Hillary Clinton s biggest industries and individuals giving to her or her Super PACs? Will Tucker, Open Secrets:  If you look at her campaign, what you ll see is very traditional Democratic sources of campaign funds: Education as an industry and lawyers and law firms, to be specific. But if you factor in her Super PACs that are supporting her, securities and investment, what we consider to be Wall Street jumps up the list. It is her number one donor industry. Haim Sabin is one of the biggest supporters of Hillary Clinton s  Priorities U.S.A. Action  Super PAC.Sharyl:  Who s Haim Saban? Tucker:  Haim Saban is the Chairman of a big media group. He is a liberal mega donor, and has been for several years. He s a very plugged in donor with the Clinton coalition. Saban and his wife have supported Hillary Clinton to the tune of $7 million dollars. Their giant media investment firm owns Univision. That s the Spanish language TV network that cancelled plans to air Trump s Miss U.S.A. pageant after he said he d build a wall on Mexico s border and crack down on illegal immigration.

VACATIONING LAME-DUCK OBAMA Ready To Announce Sanctions Against Russia,"The Obama administration plans to announce on Thursday a series of retaliatory measures against Russia for hacking into U.S. political institutions and individuals and leaking information in an effort to help President-elect Donald Trump and other Republican candidates, two U.S. officials said on Wednesday.Both officials declined to specify what actions President Barack Obama has approved, but said targeted economic sanctions, indictments, leaking information to embarrass Russian officials or oligarchs, and restrictions on Russian diplomats in the United States are among steps that have been discussed.One decision that has been made, they said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, is to avoid any moves that exceed the Russian election hacking and risk an escalating cyber conflict that could spiral out of control. One example of an excessive step might be interfering with Russian internet messaging.Russia has repeatedly denied hacking accusations. Trump has dismissed the assessments of the U.S. intelligence community.Obama, in an interview earlier this month with NPR, said,  We need to take action and we will  against Russia for interfering in the U.S. election.Trump seemed to suggest the United States should not impose sanctions on Russia. I think we ought to get on with our lives,  Trump told reporters in Florida on Wednesday when asked about remarks by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who said Russia and President Vladimir Putin should expect tough sanctions for the cyber attacks.Russia s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, promised retaliation on Wednesday against Washington in the event of new economic sanctions.Jim Lewis, a cyber security expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said further sanctions may be an effective U.S. tool in part because they would be difficult for Trump to roll back and because Russia  hates  dealing with them. For the rest of the world, it s like having  scumball  stamped on your forehead,  Lewis said.How to respond to the growing problem of cyber attacks carried out or sponsored by foreign powers has bedeviled Obama, whose eight years in office witnessed a torrent of major hacks against the U.S. government and private organizations that were attributed to China, North Korea, Iran and Russia.In past cases, administration officials have decided to publicly blame North Korea and indict members of China s military for hacking because they decided the net benefit of public shaming   and increased awareness brought to cyber security   outweighed potential risks.But determining an appropriate response to Russia s actions has proven more complicated in part because Russia s cyber capabilities are more advanced and due to fears about disrupting other geopolitical issues, such as the civil war in Syria.Obama may choose to invoke an April 2015 executive order that empowered him to levy sanctions in response to cyber attacks perpetrated by foreign groups targeting infrastructure, such as transportation, or done for economic purposes.Another option would be further economic sanctions against Russia. Washington has already sanctioned Russia over the past two years to punish Moscow for its role in annexing Crimea. But former U.S. officials say the existing measures leave Washington plenty of room to slap new, tougher sanction on Russia in response to cyber intrusions.  ReutersIn recent months, WikiLeaks and I personally have come under enormous pressure to stop publishing what the Clinton campaign says about itself to itself. That pressure has come from the campaign s allies, including the Obama administration, and from liberals who are anxious about who will be elected US President.On the eve of the election, it is important to restate why we have published what we have.The right to receive and impart true information is the guiding principle of WikiLeaks   an organization that has a staff and organizational mission far beyond myself. Our organization defends the public s right to be informed.This is why, irrespective of the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential election, the real victor is the US public which is better informed as a result of our work.The US public has thoroughly engaged with WikiLeaks  election related publications which number more than one hundred thousand documents. Millions of Americans have pored over the leaks and passed on their citations to each other and to us. It is an open model of journalism that gatekeepers are uncomfortable with, but which is perfectly harmonious with the First Amendment.We publish material given to us if it is of political, diplomatic, historical or ethical importance and which has not been published elsewhere. When we have material that fulfills this criteria, we publish. We had information that fit our editorial criteria which related to the Sanders and Clinton campaign (DNC Leaks) and the Clinton political campaign and Foundation (Podesta Emails). No-one disputes the public importance of these publications. It would be unconscionable for WikiLeaks to withhold such an archive from the public during an election.At the same time, we cannot publish what we do not have. To date, we have not received information on Donald Trump s campaign, or Jill Stein s campaign, or Gary Johnson s campaign or any of the other candidates that fufills our stated editorial criteria. As a result of publishing Clinton s cables and indexing her emails we are seen as domain experts on Clinton archives. So it is natural that Clinton sources come to us.We publish as fast as our resources will allow and as fast as the public can absorb it.That is our commitment to ourselves, to our sources, and to the public.This is not due to a personal desire to influence the outcome of the election. The Democratic and Republican candidates have both expressed hostility towards whistleblowers. I spoke at the launch of the campaign for Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, because her platform addresses the need to protect them. This is an issue that is close to my heart because of the Obama administration s inhuman and degrading treatment of one of our alleged sources, Chelsea Manning. But WikiLeaks publications are not an attempt to get Jill Stein elected or to take revenge over Ms Manning s treatment either.Publishing is what we do. To withhold the publication of such information until after the election would have been to favour one of the candidates above the public s right to know.This is after all what happened when the New York Times withheld evidence of illegal mass surveillance of the US population for a year until after the 2004 election, denying the public a critical understanding of the incumbent president George W Bush, which probably secured his reelection. The current editor of the New York Times has distanced himself from that decision and rightly so.The US public defends free speech more passionately, but the First Amendment only truly lives through its repeated exercise. The First Amendment explicitly prevents the executive from attempting to restrict anyone s ability to speak and publish freely. The First Amendment does not privilege old media, with its corporate advertisers and dependencies on incumbent power factions, over WikiLeaks  model of scientific journalism or an individual s decision to inform their friends on social media. The First Amendment unapologetically nurtures the democratization of knowledge. With the Internet, it has reached its full potential.Yet, some weeks ago, in a tactic reminiscent of Senator McCarthy and the red scare, Wikileaks, Green Party candidate Stein, Glenn Greenwald and Clinton s main opponent were painted with a broad, red brush. The Clinton campaign, when they were not spreading obvious untruths, pointed to unnamed sources or to speculative and vague statements from the intelligence community to suggest a nefarious allegiance with Russia. The campaign was unable to invoke evidence about our publications because none exists.In the end, those who have attempted to malign our groundbreaking work over the past four months seek to inhibit public understanding perhaps because it is embarrassing to them   a reason for censorship the First Amendment cannot tolerate. Only unsuccessfully do they try to claim that our publications are inaccurate.WikiLeaks  decade-long pristine record for authentication remains. Our key publications this round have even been proven through the cryptographic signatures of the companies they passed through, such as Google. It is not every day you can mathematically prove that your publications are perfect but this day is one of them.We have endured intense criticism, primarily from Clinton supporters, for our publications. Many long-term supporters have been frustrated because we have not addressed this criticism in a systematic way or responded to a number of false narratives about Wikileaks  motivation or sources. Ultimately, however, if WL reacted to every false claim, we would have to divert resources from our primary work.WikiLeaks, like all publishers, is ultimately accountable to its funders. Those funders are you. Our resources are entirely made up of contributions from the public and our book sales. This allows us to be principled, independent and free in a way no other influential media organization is. But it also means that we do not have the resources of CNN, MSNBC or the Clinton campaign to constantly rebuff criticism.Yet if the press obeys considerations above informing the public, we are no longer talking about a free press, and we are no longer talking about an informed public.Wikileaks remains committed to publishing information that informs the public, even if many, especially those in power, would prefer not to see it. WikiLeaks must publish. It must publish and be damned.",0.0

BUSTED? ITS HIGHLY LIKELY THERES A BACK-UP TO HILLARYS SERVER AND E-MAILS STILL EXIST,"Why didn t the IT firm come forward before now with the backup of Hillary s server? She s even more busted if the e-mails still exist. It s believed that she won t take the fall for this but that Abedin or Mills will. This entire mess is yet another example of why Clinton is NOT and never will be a good choice to lead America. Platte River Networks, the Denver-based cybersecurity firm Hillary Clinton hired in 2013 to maintain her old email server, says it is  highly likely  a full backup of the device was made and that the thousands of emails Clinton deleted may still exist, ABC News is reporting.On Wednesday, Platte River gave the FBI the server Clinton used as secretary of state. The Democratic presidential candidate had stated numerous times prior to that that she would not relinquish control of the server to a third party.But the FBI became interested in the hardware after the revelation that the Intelligent Community inspector general had determined that two emails that traversed the server contained  top secret  information. While Clinton is not believed to have sent the emails in question, the finding undermines her claims at the onset of the email scandal in March that no classified information ever landed on her server.

" Obama Puts Trump In His Place, DESTROYS Him With This One Statement During Farewell Address (VIDEO)","President Barack Obama gave an amazing farewell address last night as he captivated Americans across the country and said goodbye to his time as President of the United States. At a time when many of us were feeling heartbroken and depressed that this great leader would now be followed by an underserving former reality television star, Obama made sure to leave us with a message of hope and reminded us of what we re fighting for. It was a beautiful speech, and it highlighted everything we are going to miss about him.One of the more notable parts of the speech was an epic burn Obama delivered, aimed right at President-elect Donald Trump. While Obama never once said Trump s name, it was blatantly obvious who he was talking about as he spoke about the need for diverse groups of workers to unite and stand together. Slamming Trump s divisive rhetoric and policies, Obama reached out to workers of all ages, races, genders, and professions when he said: But we re not where we need to be. All of us have more work to do. After all, if every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and undeserving minorities, then workers of all shades will be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves. If we decline to invest in the children of immigrants, just because they don t look like us, we diminish the prospects of our own children   because those brown kids will represent a larger share of America s workforce. And our economy doesn t have to be a zero-sum game. Last year, incomes rose for all races, all age groups, for men and for women. Beautifully said. While Trump may have won the election by dividing Americans and speaking only to white workers in certain professions, Americans can stop him from dividing us further by standing together. Aside from preventing Trump from creating more division, united workers must also defy him by standing up to his greedy pro-corporation agenda which will only benefit the wealthiest.Obama knew that he had to inspire Americans enough to get them through the next four years under the worst administration they ve ever been faced with. He succeeded once again.You can watch Obama a full farewell address below, starting at around the 17 minute mark:Featured image via Darren Hauck / Getty Images",0.0
Palestinian stabs Israeli in Jerusalem; anti-Trump protest flares in Beirut,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A Palestinian stabbed an Israeli security guard at Jerusalem s main bus station on Sunday, police said, and violence flared near the U.S. Embassy in Beirut over U.S. President Donald Trump s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital. Four days of street protests in the Palestinian territories over Trump s announcement on Wednesday have largely died down, but his overturning of long-standing U.S. policy on Jerusalem   a city holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians   drew more Arab warnings of potential damage to prospects for Middle East peace.  Our hope is that everything is calming down and that we are returning to a path of normal life without riots and without violence,  Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said on Army Radio. But in Jerusalem, a security guard was in critical condition after a 24-year-old Palestinian man from the occupied West Bank stabbed him after approaching a metal detector at an entrance to the city s central bus station, police said. The alleged assailant was taken into custody after a passer-by tackled him. In public remarks on Sunday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, a frequent critic of Israel, called it an  invader state  and a  terror state . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who spoke at a news conference in Paris alongside French President Emmanuel Macron after the two leaders met, fired back:  I m not used to receiving lectures about morality from a leader who bombs Kurdish villages in his native Turkey, who jails journalists, helps Iran go around international sanctions and who helps terrorists, including in Gaza, kill innocent people,  Netanyahu said. Macron told Netanyahu that he needed to make gestures to the Palestinians to break the impasse between the two sides.  I asked Prime Minister Netanyahu to make some courageous gestures towards the Palestinians to get out of the current impasse,  Macron said, suggesting that a freeze of construction in settlements could be a first step.   Most countries consider East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after capturing it in a 1967 war, to be occupied territory and say the status of the city should be decided at future Israeli-Palestinian talks. Israel says that all of Jerusalem is its capital, while Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state. The Trump administration has said it is still committed to reviving Palestinian-Israeli talks that collapsed in 2014, but jettisoning old policies is necessary to break the deadlock. Washington says it has not taken a position on Jerusalem s final status or borders, but it is sensible to recognize that any future peace deal will have Israel s capital in the city. The United States was  as committed to the peace process as we ve ever been , U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Sunday. Trump  didn t talk about boundaries, he didn t talk about borders... Because the final status of Jerusalem is between the Palestinians and the Israelis. It s not for the Americans to decide.  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will not meet U.S. Vice President Mike Pence during his visit to the region, Foreign Minister Riyad Al-Maliki said on Saturday. The White House said on Sunday that decision was unfortunate and Pence looked forward to seeing Netanyahu and Egypt s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.  It s unfortunate that the Palestinian Authority is walking away again from an opportunity to discuss the future of the region,  said Jarrod Agen, a spokesman for Pence. Netanyahu reacted to critics in a statement before talks with Macron, to be followed by a meeting with European foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday.  I hear (from Europe) voices of condemnation over President Trump s historic announcement, but I have not heard any condemnation for the rocket firing against Israel that has come (after the announcement) and the awful incitement against us,  Netanyahu said. In Beirut, Lebanese security forces fired tear gas and water cannons at protesters, some of them waving Palestinian flags, near the U.S. Embassy. Demonstrators set fires in the street, torched U.S. and Israeli flags and threw projectiles towards security forces that had barricaded the main road to the complex. In the Moroccan capital, Rabat, tens of thousands of protesters marched down the city s main thoroughfare chanting slogans including,  The people want to liberate Palestine  and  Death to Israel, enemy of the people and provoker of wars.   Waving Palestinian flags and holding up pictures of Jerusalem, they expressed anger at the  betrayal  by Arab governments perceived to have backed Trump s move. In the Indonesian capital Jakarta, thousands protested outside the U.S. embassy, many waving banners saying  Palestine is in our hearts . Maliki has said the Palestinians will be looking for a new peace talks broker instead of the United States and would seek a United Nations Security Council resolution over Trump s decision. Arab foreign ministers who met in Cairo on Saturday urged the United States to abandon its decision on Jerusalem and said the move would spur violence throughout the region. Echoing that view, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahayan, the de facto leader of the United Arab Emirates, said the U.S. move  could throw a lifebuoy to terrorist and armed groups, which have begun to lose ground  in the Middle East. Along Israel s tense frontier with the Gaza Strip, the Israeli military on Sunday destroyed what it described as a  significant  cross-border attack tunnel dug by the enclave s dominant Islamist group, Hamas. There was no immediate comment from Hamas on the demolition, which came as Palestinian factions tried to meet Sunday s deadline for an Egyptian-mediated handover of Gaza by Hamas to Western-backed President Abbas after a decade s schism. Pre-dawn Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed two Palestinian gunmen after militants fired rockets from the area into Israel on Friday. ",1.0

People smugglers test new migrant sea route through Romania,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - About 500 migrants from the Middle East reached Romania across the Black Sea from Turkey in about a month, coastguards said on Monday, in a sharp increase the European Union says shows smugglers are testing alternative routes into Europe. Since 2015, the EU has been struggling to bring down the number of refugees and migrants smuggled or trafficked from the Middle East and Africa to its shores.  A 2016 deal with Turkey shut the route to EU state Greece and the bloc is now cracking down on arrivals from Libya to Italy. All in all, Mediterranean arrivals to the bloc fell from nearly 28,000 people in June to below 10,000 in August, according to U.N. data. But the Romanian coast guard told Reuters on Monday that 475 people reached its shores in about one month in August-September, including from Iraq and Iran. Seven people smugglers from Turkey, Bulgaria, Syria, Iraq and Cyprus had been arrested. While still low compared to thousands of migrants reaching Greek islands daily at the height of the arrivals in 2015, the figure marks a sharp increase from a total of 500 migrants who completed the same route in two years in 2013-2015, according to Romanian data. The EU s border agency Frontex has said it is monitoring the situation and that people smugglers might be looking for alternative entries to the bloc after the Mediterranean crossings were made more difficult.   While it is too early to talk about the opening of a new migratory route, the recent incidents of intercepted wooden boats with migrants on the Black Sea suggest that smugglers might be looking to revive this route,  said a Frontex spokesman, Krzysztof Borowski.  Frontex said the Black Sea route was last active in 2014 but did not expect it to develop on a large scale due to difficult sailing conditions on the Black Sea, especially as autumn nears. On Aug. 13, the Romanian coast guard said it had rescued 101 adults and 56 children from Iraq and Iran crowded onto a small fishing boat, in distress amid strong winds.  They were packed in there ... The boat could (only) safely   accommodate a dozen people,  a coastguard officer said. In Romania s neighbor Bulgaria, interior ministry data showed no illegal migrants had been stopped at its sea border in 2017.  Both countries are still outside of the EU s Schengen zone of free travel and hope to join as soon as possible.  While the bloc s executive has said it will soon recommend  bringing them in, many other EU states are skeptical. How the two will manage any migratory flows would be crucial to determining whether they meet the criteria.  Since joining the EU in 2007, both are also under monitoring by the EU executive arm in Brussels over justice reforms and concerns over corruption. While Ankara has cracked down on smuggling across the Mediterranean, many refugees and migrants who had made it across before are being stranded on Greek islands in poor conditions. As the bloc s relations with Turkey have grown increasingly strained since the 2016 migration deal, Brussels and EU states worry that President Tayyip Erdogan might one day walk away from the accord.  Erdogan has just lifted a lid to keep pressure on the EU. It s flexing muscles,  Romanian political analyst Mircea Marian said of the recent increase in arrivals from the Turkish coast across the Black Sea. ",1.0
 Federal Judge Just Gave Attorney General Jeff Sessions A Huge F*ck You,"A federal judge just proudly gave Jeff Sessions the middle finger by approving Baltimore s police reforms even after the attorney general had voiced his opposition.The Justice Department began investigating the Baltimore Police Department in 2014 after news reports that they had paid out millions to settle upwards of 100 lawsuits over police brutality and misconduct. Following the death of Freddie Gray in 2015, the investigation intensified. The DOJ, which was still under former President Obama at the time, found widespread unconstitutional and discriminatory practices.Mother Jones reports:  Earlier this week, Sessions ordered a review of all consent decrees between police departments and the Justice Department. Department lawyers asked the US district court in Baltimore to put off approving the consent decree for at least 30 days so the new administration could review it. I have grave concerns that some provisions of this decree will reduce the lawful powers of the police department and result in a less safe city,  Sessions said in a scathing statement.  Make no mistake, Baltimore is facing a violent crime crisis. On Friday, US District Judge James Bredar told Sessions to go to hell, informing him that  the time for negotiating the agreement is over. The case is no longer in a phase where any party is unilaterally entitled to reconsider the terms of the settlement; the parties are bound to each other by their prior agreement,  Bredar wrote.  The time for negotiating the agreement is over. The only question now is whether the Court needs more time to consider the proposed decree. It does not. According to Sessions, the agreement was put together in a rush at the very end of Obama s presidency and it looks like he is right. The final report was issued last summer but after Trump was elected, officials reportedly scrambled to get everything finalized, and for good reason. Because they managed to complete this particular task before Obama left office, Sessions  hands are now tied.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",0.0
"After 2016 campaign, more Americans consider Russia a threat: Reuters/Ipsos poll","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Americans are more concerned than they were before the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign began about the potential threat Russia poses to the country, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Friday. The Jan. 9-12 survey found that 82 percent of American adults, including 84 percent of Democrats and 82 percent of Republicans, described Russia as a general threat to the United States. Thats up from 76 percent in March 2015 when the same questions were asked. The increased concern comes after a brutal election season during which Democrats and others raised questions about President-elect Donald Trumps financial ties to Russia and the U.S. intelligence community accused Russia of engaging in cyber attacks during the election.  Trump, who has repeatedly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a strong leader and signaled during his campaign that he might take a softer line in dealing with Moscow, only recently accepted that Russia committed the hacks after receiving detailed briefings from intelligence officials.  Trump initially criticized the findings, saying the culprit could be China or somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.  The poll asked people to rate Russia and a slew of other countries on a 5-point scale ranging from no threat to imminent threat. It found that Americans were more likely to label Russia a threat than they were Iran, Syria, China, Saudi Arabia, Cuba or Yemen. Only North Korea ranked higher, with 86 percent of Americans labeling it as a threat. Some 25 percent of Americans gave Russia the highest concern, labeling it an imminent threat.  Russia is back to the old days of the Cold War, said Oneita Wilkins, 69, a Republican who lives in a suburb of New Orleans, who rated Russia an imminent threat.  Wilkins did not vote in the election. She said she did not trust Trump or Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and chose to not vote for the first time in more than 40 years. The latest reports about Russian hacking lowered her opinion of Trump even further. Trump doesnt have any experience with other countries, Wilkins said. I have a feeling that hell be easily influenced by Putin. Trump, earlier this week in his first news conference since the election, defended his goal of better ties with Putin, saying, If Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It included 1,169 American adults, including 490 Democrats and 475 Republicans. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire sample and 5 percentage points for Republicans and Democrats. ",1.0
FAMILY THREATENED AT GUNPOINT FOR DISPLAYING CONFEDERATE FLAG ON PRIVATE PROPERTYPolice Let Suspect Go [Video],"Nothing says tolerance like putting a loaded gun to a strangers head because you disagree with the flag they re holding A family was threatened at gunpoint for waving the Confederate flag on their own private property in another illustration of how controversy surrounding the flag is only driving more animosity.The incident occurred on Monday night in Moseley, Virginia while the family was expressing their First Amendment right by waving the flag in their own driveway next to a busy highway. A man driving an SUV pulled into the driveway, took out his gun, chambered a round, pointed it at the family and started yelling. He slammed on the brakes and when he got right beside me, he pulled out a gun, chambered a round and told me my cause wasn t worth anything now,  Mark Wilson told CBS 6.  He got out of the car and took three steps towards me and the gun was maybe six inches off my head. Wilson said he was concerned that the gunman would shoot his children. 46-year-old James Baker was later arrested by police for brandishing a weapon. Baker dubiously claimed that the family had threatened his life. This is a busy highway and he is in a vehicle going 70 miles per hour, how are we threatening him by walking across?  said Wilson, who called for Baker to be sent to jail. The police went and investigated it and they let him go, he admitted everything and they just let him go,  added Wilson.Baker is in court on September 3 facing a class one misdemeanor charge.Wilson asserted that his decision to fly the flag is founded on a desire to express pride in his southern heritage and has nothing to do with racism. I m not gonna be scared away from people that are acting ignorant and trying to act violent when it s not a violent thing. This shouldn t be a race thing, it should be a heritage thing,  Wilson told NBC 12.The nature of the confrontation clearly illustrates how the gunman had a political gripe with the family displaying the Confederate flag, which has become a target for irate leftists in the aftermath of the Charleston shooting.On Monday we reported on the new viral Twitter craze called #NoFlaggingChallenge which Black Lives Matter supporters are using to encourage Americans to violate people s private property rights and steal Confederate flags being displayed on privately owned homes and vehicles.Given that the flags are predominantly displayed in southern states where private ownership of firearms is common, many on social media are warning that the stunt could end up with people being shot dead.Via: Infowars",0.0
ROB SCHNEIDER Nails The Russia Conspiracy Theorists In One Hysterical Tweet, ,0.0
BREAKING STORY! TRUE EVIL EXPOSED: [Video] PLANNED PARENTHOOD DIRECTOR Caught On Video Selling Aborted Baby Parts,"B b but I thought they said they re just trying to provide quality  health care  for women .An undercover video recorded by the non-profit organization, Center for Medical Progress, shows Planned Parenthood Federation Senior Director of Medical Services, Dr. Deborah Nucatola, discussing their fetal parts business.Nucatola is seen in the video having lunch with actors posing as buyers who are interested in purchasing the body parts of babies who have been aborted. The Planned Parenthood senior staffer notes how abortion procedures are modified to ensure that requested body parts can be collected. She says: We ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I m not gonna crush that part, I m gonna basically crush below, I m gonna crush above, and I m gonna see if I can get it all intact. Nucatola also describes how Planned Parenthood abortionists move the preborn child into a breech delivery position so that the body can be preserved. This account is an almost exact medical description of partial-birth abortions which are illegal in the United States. In the video, Nucatola describes the procedure: I d say a lot of people want liver. And for that reason, most providers will do this case under ultrasound guidance, so they ll know where they re putting their forceps. The kind of rate-limiting step of the procedure is calvarium. Calvarium the head is basically the biggest part.  We ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I m not gonna crush that part, I m gonna basically crush below, I m gonna crush above, and I m gonna see if I can get it all intact. And with the calvarium, in general, some people will actually try to change the presentation so that it s not vertex.  So if you do it starting from the breech presentation, there s dilation that happens as the case goes on, and often, the last step,you can evacuate an intact calvarium at the end. Planned Parenthood, though, appears to be concerned internally about the legality of their own behavior, as Nucatola notes how,  At the national office, we have a Litigation and Law Department which just really doesn t want us to be the middle people for this issue right now. U.S. federal law states that,  It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration if the transfer affects interstate commerce. Live Action President Lila Rose has been active for years in exposing wrongdoing at Planned Parenthood through undercover investigations. She responded to the disturbing investigative video, saying:This investigation by the Center for Medical Progress reveals the unimaginable horror that is Planned Parenthood. The exploitation of human life, the cover-up, and the black market profiteering by America s largest abortion chain is not only egregious and heartbreaking, but exposes how the abortion giant is corrupt to the core   from the CEO, Cecile Richards, down to the local clinic. As Live Action has investigated through the years, Planned Parenthood s barbaric practices reveal their contempt for rule of law and human life. This latest expose of Planned Parenthood s trafficking of baby parts for profit should be the final nail in the coffin for the abortion giant. Congress must take immediate action to stop all taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood and end the bankrolling of this horrific human rights abuser.Via: LiveActionNews",0.0
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR Justifies Leaking of Trumps Phone Conversations [Video],"Senator Jeanne Shaheen justifies leaking phone conversations of President Trump! She says that Trump s tweeting is  a problem  and that it s a  serious situation . She s on the Foreign Relations Committee!MSNBC s Chris Matthews asked Shaheen what she thought of officials leaking the conversations: My experience is that when people feel like they need to leak something like that, it s because they have concerns about what s going on and I think that s one of the challenges. When we have a president who tries to make national security policy or foreign policy through tweeting, then we have a problem, and my guess is that s why people are leaking this kind of information, because they want the public to know how serious this situation is. What in the world is this woman talking about? Under no circumstances is this ok! Shaheen is on the Foreign Relations Committee! Her website says: As a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Senator Shaheen is committed to helping build strong international alliances to bolster America s national security and boost our economy.How will it help  international alliances  if the world leaders are fearful of leaks if they call President Trump?",0.0
 BOMBSHELL: Senate Intel Committee Hearing Reveals FRIGHTENING Extent Of Russias Meddling,"While the House Intelligence Committee s investigation into Russia s interference in our political process is a mess, the Senate Intelligence Committee is busily working together to conduct their own investigation in as impartial a manner as possible. And today s open hearing revealed a kicker: Russia s meddling with the U.S. government did not stop with the 2016 election.It s actually still going on.Clinton Watts, a senior fellow at the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security, said: This past week we observed social media campaigns targeting speaker of the House Paul Ryan hoping to foment further unrest amongst US democratic institutions. He went on to tell the Senate Intel panel this: They were in full swing during both the Republican and Democratic primary season   and may have helped sink the hopes of candidates more hostile to Russian interests long before the field narrowed. Sen. Rubio, in my opinion, you anecdotally suffered from these efforts. CNN acknowledges that today s hearing may well not be anything like as explosive as James Comey s statement to the House that the FBI is, in fact, investigating Trump for possible collusion with Russia during the election. However, this hearing is focused on Russia s disinformation campaign, which vice-chairman Mark Warner said was a deliberate attempt to undermine our elections.Yesterday, both Warner and Richard Burr, the committee s chairman, said that the committee had an unprecedented number of documents from Congress   Gang of Eight,  which usually severely restricts access to just such information. The Senate Intel Committee is busy trying to learn as much as it can before it calls in high-profile witnesses such as Paul Manafort, Carter Page, and even Jared Kushner and Michael Flynn.They have a list of 20 witnesses they plan to call in so far, but they haven t set dates as to when those witnesses will come in. With Watts  testimony today, though, things could get very interesting very quickly over in the Senate.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images",0.0
"Turkey, Iran, Iraq consider counter-measures over Kurdish referendum","ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey, Iran and Iraq have agreed to consider counter-measures against Kurdish northern Iraq over a planned independence referendum, Turkey s foreign ministry said on Thursday. In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of the three countries voiced concerns that the referendum would endanger the gains Iraq has made against Islamic State, and reiterated their fears over the potential for new conflicts in the region.  In the meeting, the three ministers emphasized that the referendum will not be beneficial for the Kurds and the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG), and agreed, in this regard, to consider taking counter-measures in coordination,  the statement said. The statement gave no details on the possible measures but said the ministers, who were in New York attending the United Nations General Assembly, called on the international community to intervene. Turkey s President Tayyip Erdogan has threatened to impose sanctions against Kurdish northern Iraq. Turkish troops are also carrying out military exercises near the border. The central government in Baghdad, Iraq s neighbors and Western powers fear the vote could divide the country and spark a wider regional conflict, after Arabs and Kurds cooperated to dislodge Islamic State from its stronghold in Mosul. The statement said Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and their Iraqi counterpart Ibrahim al-Jaafari expressed concerns that conflicts surfacing as a result of the referendum would  prove difficult to contain . But the Kurds say they are determined to go ahead with the vote, which, though non-binding, could trigger the process of separation in a country already divided along sectarian and ethnic lines. The three ministers also voiced their  strong commitment  to maintain Iraq s territorial and political unity, the foreign ministry s statement said. Turkey, which has pulled forward a cabinet meeting and national security council session to Friday over the referendum, will also convene parliament for an extraordinary meeting on Saturday, the chairman of the ruling AK Party s parliamentary group said on Thursday.

"Trump, Clinton blast each other on character; Clinton rises in poll","PENSACOLA, Fla./ LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump attacked one anothers character as they pushed their closing arguments six days before the U.S. presidential election, while the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Clintons lead over Trump rising back to the margin she held last week. Many national polls have shown Clintons lead over Trump narrowing since the re-emergence Friday of a controversy over her use of a private email while secretary of state. But the latest Reuters/Ipsos daily tracking poll released on Wednesday showed Clintons lead over Trump rising back up to 6 percentage points, the same advantage she held before the FBI announcement related to her email practices.  Signs of a tightening race have rattled financial markets as investors started to factor in the possibility that the New York businessman might pull off a victory on Nov. 8. World stocks, the dollar and oil fell on Wednesday, while safe-haven assets such as gold and the Swiss franc rose. Clinton has been regarded as the candidate who would maintain the status quo, an important factor to financial markets, which generally do not like uncertainty. Campaigning in Pensacola, Florida, Trump predicted he would win, telling supporters at the outdoor rally, Its feeling like it already, isnt it? Weve got to be nice and cool, nice and cool. Alright, stay on point, Donald, stay on point. No sidetracks, Donald, nice and easy, said Trump, whose campaign has at times been damaged by controversial unscripted remarks. Trump argued that Clinton was unqualified to lead the country, calling her totally unhinged. Speaking to supporters in Las Vegas, Clinton blamed Trump for pitting Americans against one another, citing his rhetoric on groups like Muslims and Mexican-Americans. Trump, she said, is out of his depth, and she called his proposals on foreign policy issues incredibly dangerous. He doesnt have a clue, Clinton said.  Investor anxiety has deepened in recent days over a possible Trump victory given uncertainty about his stance on issues including foreign policy, trade relations and immigrants. Trump, who has never previously run for elected office, has run an unorthodox campaign, with policy proposals including reviewing trade pacts such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and imposing a temporary ban on Muslims seeking to enter the country. Currency traders have sold the dollar this week in part because they suspect Trump would prefer a weaker dollar given his protectionist stance on international trade, and in part because the uncertainty surrounding a Trump win might lead to a more dovish stance from the Federal Reserve in the months ahead, instead of the interest rate hike that many expect by year-end. A rise in U.S. interest rates would make the dollar, and dollar-denominated assets, more attractive to investors. A Reuters equity market poll last month showed a majority of forecasters predicted that U.S. stocks would perform better under a Clinton presidency than a Trump administration. An average of polls compiled by the RealClearPolitics website showed Clinton just 1.7 percent ahead of Trump nationally on Wednesday, with 47 percent support to his 45.3 percent. Clintons position is stronger than national polls imply given that the race is decided by the Electoral College system of tallying wins on a state-by-state basis. Winning the presidency requires a majority of 270 electoral votes, and Democrats have a built-in advantage with large states such as California and New York traditionally voting Democratic.  Clinton looked likely to win at least 226 electoral votes, meaning she would need to pick up votes in toss-up states such as Florida, North Carolina, Virginia, Ohio, Iowa, Arizona, Colorado and Nevada, according to estimates by RealClearPolitics on Wednesday afternoon. Trump, on the other hand, has a steeper path to climb, looking likely to win 180 electoral votes, meaning he needs more votes from the battleground states, the website showed. Both candidates are focusing their final campaign efforts on those crucial states. Trump and Clinton have campaigned intensively in recent weeks in Florida, which yields a rich haul of 29 electoral votes. A RealClearPolitics average of polls in the state puts Trump 0.7 point ahead of Clinton.  In North Carolina on Wednesday, Clinton deployed President Barack Obama to make the case that Trump posed a unique threat to the future of the country.  The fate of the republic rests on your shoulders, Obama told supporters in Chapel Hill, calling Trump temperamentally unfit to lead the nation. Trumps campaign announced plans to run three ads during Wednesday nights Game Seven of the World Series, held in Cleveland, Ohios second biggest city. The ads focus on the renewed controversy surrounding Clintons email server. In an ad titled Corruption, an announcer says: Hillary cut deals for donors. Now the FBI has launched a new investigation. After decades of lies and scandal, her corruption is closing in. ",1.0
 This Video Shows Trump Backing Racial Violence In A Shocking Way We Havent Seen Before,"Donald Trump moved a step closer to officially sanctioning racial violence being committed in his name by telling multiple media outlets that he would be  take a look at  paying the legal fees for John McGraw, who punched a black protester at a Trump rally in North Carolina.Appearing on Meet the Press with Chuck Todd, Trump accused the protester of being  very taunting  and being  very loud, very disruptive  and  sticking a certain finger up in the air  so he would  take a look at  paying the legal fees.While Todd is usually complacent with conservative Republicans on his show making bizarre allegations, even he appeared to be taken aback with Trump s show of solidarity, and asked if the leading Republican candidate was condoning the attack. Trump argued that he had not condoned the assault, despite doing just that, and said,  maybe [the attacker] doesn t like seeing what s happening to the country. The man who Trump says he has instructed his legal team into looking into helping was no benign protester. Multiple videos showed McGraw sucker punching the protester as he was being taken out of Trump s rally. In a video posted right after the incident, McGraw proudly said,  The next time we see him, we might have to kill him. McGraw was arrested and has been charged with assault, disorderly conduct and communicating threats. The police department is also investigating why McGraw was not arrested immediately on site by the police officers tasked with maintaining security at the Trump rally.Trump has repeatedly made up racial and ethnic scapegoats for his mostly white base of supporters to blame for society s ills and problems, feeding into a narrative pushed for decades by white supremacists and white power groups. He has blamed Latinos, black activists, and Muslims for problems like terrorism, drugs, unemployment and even the failure to say  Merry Christmas. It is an audience primed to explode into violence, and as Secretary Hillary Clinton said,  If you play with matches, you re going to start a fire you can t control. That s not leadership. That s political arson. Featured image via YouTube",0.0
"U.S. Congress to let Iran deadline pass, leave decision to Trump","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress will allow a deadline on reimposing sanctions on Iran to pass this week, congressional and White House aides said on Tuesday, leaving a pact between world powers and Tehran intact at least temporarily. In October, Trump declined to certify that Iran was complying with the nuclear agreement reached among Tehran, the United States and others in 2015. His decision triggered a 60-day window for Congress to decide whether to bring back sanctions on Iran. Congressional leaders have announced no plans to introduce a resolution to reimpose sanctions before Wednesdays deadline and aides say lawmakers will let the deadline pass without action. By doing that, Congress passes the ball back to Trump, who must decide in mid-January if he wants to continue to waive energy sanctions on Iran. Trumps failure to do so would blow apart the deal, a course opposed by European allies, Russia and China, the other parties to the accord, under which Iran got sanctions relief in return for curbing its nuclear ambitions. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and denies it has aimed to build an atomic bomb. It has said it will stick to the accord as long as the other signatories respect it, but will shred the deal if Washington pulls out.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the administration was not asking for sanctions to be reimposed. The administration continues to make encouraging progress with Congress to fix the U.S.Iran deal and address long-term proliferation issues, she told a daily press briefing. Efforts to find common ground with Europe on the Iran deal were complicated again last week, when Trump announced Washington would recognize Jerusalem as Israels capital, breaking with international consensus. Trump has called the Iran pact the worst deal ever and has threatened to pull the United States out of it.  His fellow Republicans control both chambers of Congress  but their Senate majority is so small that they need some Democratic support to advance most legislation. Senate Democrats, even those who opposed it two years ago, do not want to tear up the nuclear accord. Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, declined to say whether he thought Trump would carry through on a threat to tear up the nuclear pact in January if Congress does not pass legislation to further clamp down on Iran. Corker told reporters he and Democratic Senator Ben Cardin met national security adviser H.R. McMaster last week to see if theres language that fits the bill here within Congress but also ... keeps them (the Europeans) at the table with us and not feeling like weve gone off in a different direction. Corker declined to elaborate on specifics of the discussions. Trump threatened to withdraw from the nuclear agreement if lawmakers did not toughen it by amending the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, or INARA, the U.S. law that opened the possibility of bringing sanctions back. Cardin, the senior Democrat on the Senate foreign relations panel, has said he would not support changes to the nuclear pact that are not supported by Europe. Democrats also insist that while sanctions should be imposed over Irans ballistic missiles program or human rights violations, they must be separate from the nuclear agreement.     ",1.0
First Time in 30 Years: US Deploys B-52 Bombers to Qatar to bomb ISIS?,"21st Century Wire says Is Washington preparing to carpet bomb Raqqa? If so, what will be the  trigger  for this boldly adroit military maneuver to deploy B-52 Bombers to the Middle East?Back in Dec 2015, GOP contender Ted Cruz vowed he would  carpet bomb ISIS  if elected president (and to hell with any collateral damage). He recently repeated that call on FOX network s Kelly File show. If I am elected president, we will defeat radical Islamic terrorism, and we will utterly destroy ISIS,  he said.  And yes that means carpet bombing them into oblivion.  But it s not Cruz ramping up the Pentagon s military footprint   it s Barack Obama who is the international aggressor, but he s  leading from behind  safely in the background in order to preserve his party s fast-diminishing dovish allure in a delicate election year.Regardless, the U.S. are desperate to save face in the Middle East after 5 years of failed policy and arming terrorists in Syria and northern Iraq while acting as if they were forming a Coalition to defeat the terrorists   a totally fraudulent narrative (yes, you read that correctly, and the evidence is now in).Is this a sign of thing to come..?In a conventional conflict, the B-52 can perform air interdiction, offensive counter-air and maritime operations. During Desert Storm, B-52s delivered 40 percent of all the weapons dropped by coalition forces. It is highly effective when used for ocean surveillance, and can assist the U.S. Navy in anti-ship and mine-laying operations. Two B-52s, in two hours, can monitor 140,000 square miles (364,000 square kilometers) of ocean surface. All B-52s are equipped with an electro-optical viewing system that uses platinum silicide forward-looking infrared and high resolution low-light-level television sensors to augment the targeting, battle assessment, flight safety and terrain-avoidance system, thus further improving its combat ability and low-level flight capability. (U.S. Air Force photo) RTAmerican B-52 Stratofortress bombers have been sent for their first Middle East operational deployment since the 1991 Gulf War 26 years ago. The aircraft are flying from Qatar to bomb Islamic State targets.An undisclosed number of B-52s have arrived at the Al Udeid Air Base on Sunday, the US Air Force said. The B-52 will provide the coalition continued precision and deliver desired airpower effects, Lt. Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., commander, US Air Forces Central Command said in the statement.The B-52 is a long-range multi-purpose heavy bomber. The Central Command last used them during Operation Desert Storm against Saddam Hussein s Iraq, when the aircraft flew sorties from Saudi Arabia.The deployment is meant to replace a contingent of B-1 Lancer swing-wing bombers which departed the Middle East in January for maintenance and a series of upgrades, the US Army s Stars and Stripes reported. The B-52 demonstrates our continued resolve to apply persistent pressure on Daesh and defend the region in any future contingency,  Brown said, referring to Islamic State by its Arabic-language acronym.The deployment comes shortly after Russia used its long-range Tupolev Tu-22, Tu-95 and Tu-160 bombers to strike terrorist targets in Syria. The Russian aircraft flew from their home bases over the Caspian Sea, Iran and Iraq to reach the Syrian territory.READ MORE PENTAGON NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Pentagon Files",0.0
Detroit mayor unveils budget with eye on shedding state oversight,"(Reuters) - Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan proposed a $2.6 billion fiscal 2017 budget on Thursday that he said could be the citys ticket to removing state oversight of its finances. He said the all-funds budget, which includes $1.077 billion of general fund spending, would mark the third-straight balanced budget for the city, which exited the biggest-ever municipal bankruptcy in December 2014. A financial review commission was created under Michigan law to oversee a post-bankruptcy Detroit until it reaches certain benchmarks. If we can finish the 2017 fiscal year with a balanced budget and were paying our bills and meeting some other conditions that I believe well meet, we will be able to get out of the financial review commission control period, Duggan told the city council. He added the goal is to shed state oversight by January 2018. If the city ends fiscal 2017 with a deficit, the mayor said Detroit would have to start a new three-year balanced budget cycle. Detroit Chief Financial Officer John Hill said the budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 is based on conservative revenue estimates that could be hurt if the state cuts revenue sharing to local governments to deal with costs for the ongoing lead-tainted water crisis in Flint.  The mayor said he plans to tap $50 million in unused, voter-approved bond proceeds dating as far back as 1987 for various projects. Duggan also addressed a $490 million increase in the unfunded liability for Detroits two pension funds caused by the use of outdated mortality tables by the citys bankruptcy consultants. The situation has become pretty adversarial with the consultants, who have been told by the city not to destroy any of the documents they took with them, according to the mayor. He cautioned the council that a malpractice lawsuit against the consultants would be difficult to win.  ",1.0
"Thai junta leader, backers fuel suspicions of plans to stay in power","BANGKOK (Reuters) - In his dark suit, Thai junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha cut an incongruous figure guiding a rice tractor across a muddy paddy field in front of cameras and watching villagers. The prime minister s latest photo opportunity won applause from farmers watching in straw hats and his visit to Suphan Buri on Monday brought a call from a local political bigwig for him to stay in power for another decade. Political activities in Thailand have been suspended since Prayuth s 2014 coup, but Thai politicians are asking whether what looks like campaigning is exactly what it seems. The trips to the countryside, a new Facebook account and a chorus of political groups offering support are raising suspicions of a plan to keep Prayuth in power even if long-promised elections happen next year.  It s not beyond expectations that he is out campaigning in the provinces to prepare to become prime minister again,  said Chaturon Chaisang, a leader of the Pheu Thai party, which under various names has won every election for a generation. Since August, Prayuth has visited six provinces, including places traditionally considered important battlegrounds for elections. Such trips with his cabinet will now be monthly. In the previous three years, he had only taken two such trips outside Bangkok.  I am not here to make people love me, but I want everyone to love the country,  Prayuth, 63, told farmers in Suphan Buri, 100 km (60 miles) north of Bangkok.  Said 60-year-old farmer Samruay Tongpratet:  If the prime minister can truly help the poor then he can stay as long as he wants.   Prayuth s office declined to comment on any plan to keep him in power.  Politics will not resume until well after the cremation next month of the revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died last October, and the subsequent coronation of his son, King Maha Vajiralongkorn.  In the meantime, Prayuth has the field to himself.   That s why he needed to hold these mobile cabinet meetings in the provinces, act more like a politician, hold rallies, and meet the people,  said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University, noting the signs that Prayuth wants to stay longer.  Last month, Prayuth set up a Facebook page with pictures of him walking with his arm around a farmer s shoulder and giving alms to monks. It now has nearly 11,000 likes. A poll in June showed that 53 percent of Thais would like Prayuth to serve another term. Although Thailand s economic growth lags other countries in Southeast Asia and dissent is strongly repressed, surveys show that Prayuth s backers welcome the stability since the coup. Whether that calm survives electioneering is another question after over a decade of turmoil between colour-coded factions that Prayuth said he sought to end with his coup. On one side is the  yellow  Democrat Party, which is popular with middle-class voters and has strong support in Bangkok and parts of the south. On the other side is the  red  movement of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, whose parties appeal to poorer voters, particularly in the populous northeast. Thaksin s sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, was overthrown by Prayuth in the 2014 coup and last month fled Thailand ahead of a verdict in a corruption trial - eliminating a charismatic party figurehead who might also have rallied opposition to Prayuth. Although he cannot technically stand for election because he would have needed to resign by July, a new constitution drawn up at the junta s behest does offer him a route.  He could be chosen as an  outside prime minister  - foreseen under the constitution if the winning party fails to get enough votes for its candidate in the 500-member lower house of parliament. In such a case, the upper house would also have a say - its 250 members will be picked by the military. Prayuth would still need support from at least half the lower house, however. Although neither of Thailand s two main political parties has said it would endorse him, smaller players are mobilizing. Paiboon Nititawan, a former member of a now-defunct reform council, has set up an office for a new People s Reform Party to back Prayuth.  Suchart Chantharachotikul, a classmate of Prayuth from military school, told Reuters he is coordinating smaller parties to form a grouping to back the junta leader.   Prayuth s military government isn t perfect, but they took care of problems like unrest. It wouldn t be so strange if he stays on for another four years,  Suchart said. A composer of sentimental ballads, Prayuth has dropped hints in his music of a longer term political future. His latest song,  Bridge , repeats a message that he will stay as long as it takes to steer Thailand through troubled waters.  My two hands won t let you go,  says one refrain. ",1.0

UPDATE ON 9/11 MEMORIAL Banned for Triggering College Snowflakes,"Great news! Southern Methodist University in Texas has reversed its decision to relocate an annual 9/11 memorial display made up of nearly 3,000 American flags to a less prominent part of campus after facing backlash from student groups.A huge thank you to The Young Americans for Freedom group! They had a hand in making this happen! They also were the ones who had set up the tribute honoring the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on SMU s Dallas Hall Lawn every year since 2010.But in July officials informed the group to move the display to Morrison-McGinnis Park because Dallas Hall Lawn is used for classes and a variety of events, said university spokesman Kent Best.SMU officials also had adopted a policy to ensure displays didn t include  harmful or triggering  messages, but they later removed the language from the then-policy as inappropriate. By that time, though, some student groups said the new policy was an attack on free speech. I don t believe it s the responsibility of the university to shield individuals from certain ideas that they might be offended by,  said Grant Wolf, the leader of the Young Americans for Freedom group, according to Dallas News. Wolf, along with other leaders from campus groups, sent a letter to university President R. Gerald Turner to express their frustration with the policy.  People absolutely have to have a right to their own opinions, but this does not come with a right to be shielded from opposing ideas, especially in an environment dedicated to the learning, sharing and developing of new ideas,  they wrote.They decried the relocation of the memorial. Moving the 9/11 memorial to an out of the way park is almost the same as not allowing it, said Heather Hall, president of the university s Turning Point USA chapter.  That s not free speech,  Hall said.  That s not American. That s definitely not what SMU stands for.   Read more:  Daily MailOUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THIS BAN: The shocker about this is that students on both sides of the political spectrum want the 9/11 flags to be displayed where they ve always been displayed. The inability of college campuses to stand up to people who are perpetually offended is a sad statement on where we are in American tolerance these days. It s so ironic that the left wants you to march to their drum beat or else they will destroy you. Note to SMU: You had a good thing going with your student body coming together to memorialize 9/11 so let it continue!DALLAS, Tex.   In a time of extreme political divide, students both Republican and Democrat at one Texas college have found something they can agree on.For the past two years at Southern Methodist University, a campus group has planted thousands of American flags in front of Dallas Hall as a memorial to the victims of the 9/11 attacks. That s simply contradictory to the very definition of free speech,  said Grant Wolf, the Young Americans for Freedom Chairman.But in July, SMU changed its policy, saying student groups can no longer have displays there.The lawn has historically hosted tributes and protests from students of all political affiliations. The leaders of two prominent student groups say the policy violates their right to free speech. They re basically cornering us into a segment of campus and saying you re not allowed to have a display here because it s triggering, harmful or offensive to students over there,  said Drew Wicker, the President of SMU College Republicans.SMU released a statement saying nearby Momac Park, where displays will be allowed, is larger than the lawn and is along one of the most prominent drives on campus.The university said it  respects the rights of all campus community members to express their opinions, as well as their right to be free from coercion or harassment.

 Sean Hannity Disrespects Family Of Slain DNC Staffer In Sorry Quest To Prove No Trump/Russia Link,"Conspiracy-loving conservatives are once again all over last summer s murder of Seth Rich, a DNC staffer they believe leaked the DNC s emails to Wikileaks rather than Russia. They re yelling about it as loudly as they can because if it were true, then it would serve to demonstrate that there s no connection between Trump s campaign and Russia. This latest round of frothing over Rich s death began when Rod Wheeler, a legal commentator at Fox News, claimed he could confirm that Rich leaked those emails during an appearance Fox 5 D.C. Now Rich s family is demanding that Wheeler stop altogether, which should make others shut up too out of simple respect for them. But some don t seem to care.Rich s family sent a cease-and-desist letter to Wheeler, threatening legal action if he continued to spew his conspiracy theories about Rich s death. It seems, though, that Sean Hannity is either unaware of the family s wishes, or he just plain doesn t care. Chances are, it s the latter, since he wants to continue telling himself that Trump is his lord and savior and perfect in every way. He tweeted:Seth Rich was murdered last year in what officials believe was a botched robbery. Hannity has been screaming about it on Twitter ever since Wheeler claimed to  know  stuff on television, ignoring key facts and statements about the case is his desperation to prove that there was zero collusion between Trump s campaign and Russia.Rich s family blasted Wheeler for his statements, as well they should. A sudden death in any family is exceptionally traumatic. They said: Your statements and actions have caused, and continue to cause, the Family severe mental anguish and emotional distress. Your behavior appears to have been deliberate, intentional, outrageous, and in patent disregard of the Agreement and the obvious damage and suffering it would cause the Family Your improper and unauthorized statements, many of which are false and have no basis in fact, have also injured the memory and reputation of Seth Rich and have defamed and injured the reputation and standing of the members of the Family. Hannity should be castigated for his insistence on pushing this conspiracy theory to his not insignificant Twitter audience, as should Newt Gingrich and the Fox News network for pushing it on the air. This story has repeatedly been debunked, and the family wants everyone to shut it and let Rich rest in peace.If the story were true, it might be easier to understand why the media wouldn t leave it alone against Rich s family s wishes. But it s a vapid conspiracy that right-wingers like Hannity are pushing in a pathetic, desperate attempt to deflect attention away from the Trump-Russia connection.Featured image by Paul Zimmerman via Getty Images",0.0
White House narrows search to three for Supreme Court,"WASHINGTON/AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - The White House has narrowed its search for a U.S. Supreme Court nominee to three federal appeals court judges, Sri Srinivasan, Merrick Garland and Paul Watford, a source familiar with the selection process said on Friday. Srinivasan, an Indian-American who served under presidents of both parties before President Barack Obama named him as an appellate judge, and Garland, considered but passed over for the Supreme Court twice before by Obama, are considered the leading contenders, according to the source and two other sources close to the process. Obama is searching for a replacement for long-serving conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13. Senate Republicans have vowed not to hold confirmation hearings or an up-or-down vote on any nominee picked by the Democratic president for the lifetime position on the court. Senate Republicans, hoping a candidate from their party wins the Nov. 8 presidential election, want the next president, who takes office in January, to make the selection.  A formal announcement could come as soon as Monday. That would give Obama the weekend to think about his final choice and make an announcement before Tuesdays presidential primary elections in five states including Florida and Ohio. Srinivasan, 49, and Garland, 63, serve together on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That appeals court has served as a springboard to the Supreme Court for several justices including Scalia in recent decades. Srinivasan, who was born in India and grew up in Kansas, would be the first Asian-American and first Hindu on the high court. Obama appointed him to the appeals court in 2013. The Senate confirmed him in a 97-0 vote. Srinivasan served in the Justice Department under Democratic and Republican presidents and worked as a clerk to the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court, Sandra Day OConnor, a Republican appointee. Garland, who has earned praise from lawmakers of both parties, is the chief judge of the Washington appeals court, where he has served since being appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1997, winning confirmation in a 76-23 vote. Prior to that, he served in the Justice Department under Clinton. Watford, 48, is a judge on the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, winning Senate confirmation in a 61-34 vote in 2012. He previously worked as a prosecutor and in private practice. If confirmed, he would be the nations third black justice, following current justice Clarence Thomas, appointed in 1991, and Thurgood Marshall, who retired in 1991 and died in 1993. Obama is the first black U.S. president. It was unclear whether the other two other candidates who had been expected to be interviewed by Obama, federal appeals court judge Jane Kelly and federal trial judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, were now out of the running altogether. Kelly is a judge on the St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Jackson is a federal trial judge in Washington. Both were appointed to those positions by Obama. Without Scalia, the Supreme Court is evenly split with four liberals and four conservatives. An Obama appointment could tilt the court to the left for the first time in decades. Obama is traveling in Texas, where he spoke at Austins South by Southwest festival on Friday and is appearing at Democratic fundraisers. He returns to Washington late on Saturday. ",1.0
" Millionaire Sean Hannity Tried To Fake Being Middle Class, Gets DESTROYED On Twitter (TWEETS)","Fox News host and Donald Trump cheerleader Sean Hannity got busted for trying to pretend that he is something that he s not.In the process of yet again defending Trump, this time after his disastrous debate appearance on Monday night, Hannity lashed out at the press: Now, my overpaid friends in the media, well, they have their chauffeured limousines, they like their fine steakhouses and expensive wine lifestyles. Based on that statement, you might think that Hannity was just a regular Joe Sixpack, toiling away for a middle-class income at best, trying to make ends meet while paying his mortgage, electric bill and keeping his family fed.But of course, as the host of a highly rated cable news show and a nationally syndicated radio show, Hannity is anything but underpaid.For his radio show alone, Hannity earns  at least $20 million a year, and he has also signed a multi-million-dollar contract for his Fox News program.A few years ago, Hannity listed his waterfront home in New York for sale, asking $3.6 million for 4 bedrooms and 5.5 bathrooms set on 2 acres of land on the Long Island Sound. Hardly the home of a middle class family.Almost immediately, journalists and political operatives and pundits started making fun of Hannity s weird statement on Twitter. The fact that Hannity, whose wealth is well-known, would attack journalists for being rich struck many as completely absurd. It was pointed out that he reportedly has a net worth of $80 million, has a private jet he s used to ferry politicians like former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich around, and even has done ads for the pricy steak house Ruth s Chris.Hannity thought he could get away with this white lie on Fox News, where this sort of thing happens all the time, but especially since he has attached himself to Trump, it isn t going to work anymore.Sean Hannity travels on a GD private jet.

"BUSTED: The Oh So Objective ABC News Chief Anchor, George Stephanopoulous Made Huge Donation To Clinton Foundation","Just like Hillary Stephanopoulos claims it was an  honest mistake  not to disclose his donations to the corrupt Clinton slush fund ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopoulos has given $50,000 to the Clinton Foundation in recent years, charitable contributions that he did not publicly disclose while reporting on the Clintons or their non-profit organization, the On Media blog has learned.In both 2013 and 2014, Stephanopoulos made a $25,000 donation to the 501 nonprofit founded by former president Bill Clinton, the Foundation s records show. Stephanopoulos never disclosed this information to viewers, even when interviewing author Peter Schweizer last month about his book  Clinton Cash,  which alleges that donations to the Foundation may have influenced some of Hillary Clinton s actions as Secretary of State.In a statement to the On Media blog on Thursday, Stephanopoulos apologized and said that he should have disclosed the donations to ABC News and its viewers.Watch George discuss the problem with donations to the Clinton Foundation on the Daily Show with John Stewart, and how it might make people question if donations to the Foundation could be seen as  pernicious : I made charitable donations to the Foundation in support of the work they re doing on global AIDS prevention and deforestation, causes I care about deeply,  he said.  I thought that my contributions were a matter of public record. However, in hindsight, I should have taken the extra step of personally disclosing my donations to my employer and to the viewers on air during the recent news stories about the Foundation. I apologize. Stephanopoulos is the chief anchor and chief political correspondent for ABC News, as well as the co-anchor of ABC s  Good Morning America  and host of  This Week,  its Sunday morning public affairs program. Prior to joining ABC News, he served as communications director and senior advisor for policy and strategy to President Clinton. He also served as communications director on Bill Clinton s 1992 presidential campaign.In its own statement on Thursday, ABC News said it was standing behind its star anchor. As George has said, he made charitable donations to the Foundation to support a cause he cares about deeply and believed his contributions were a matter of public record,  the network s statement read.  He should have taken the extra step to notify us and our viewers during the recent news reports about the Foundation. He s admitted to an honest mistake and apologized for that omission. We stand behind him. ABC News later told the On Media blog that it would not take any punitive action against Stephanopoulos:  We accept his apology,  a spokesperson said.  It was an honest mistake. Sources with knowledge of Stephanopoulos  charitable giving said he gives to dozens of charities Stephanopoulosevery year and that the total sum of these annual contributions is in the millions of dollars. Those sources said that the Clinton Foundation contributions represent a very small percentage of the total.On the April 26 edition of  This Week,  Stephanopoulos interviewed Schweizer and challenged the author s assertions that Hillary Clinton may have committed a crime because there was a  troubling pattern  between donations to the Foundation and Clinton s actions as Secretary of State. We ve done investigative work here at ABC News, found no proof of any kind of direct action,  the host told Schweizer.  An independent government ethics expert, Bill Allison, of the Sunlight Foundation, wrote this. He said,  There s no smoking gun, no evidence that she changed the policy based on donations to the foundation.  No smoking gun. Later in the interview, Stephanopoulos said,  I still haven t heard any direct evidence and you just said you had no evidence that she intervened here.  He also noted that other news organizations that used Schweizer s research  haven t confirmed any evidence of any crime. Among the more notable revelations to come out of Schweizer s research is the relationship between the Clinton Foundation and Uranium One, a former Canadian mining company that was taken over by Russia in 2013 with U.S. government approval. Between 2009 to 2013, Uranium One s chairman donated $2.35 million to the Clinton Foundation.Hillary Clinton has said that there is  not an inherent conflict of interest  between the Foundation donations and her decisions at the State Department. Her campaign has consistently dismissed the accusations as partisan attacks.Via: Politico",0.0

LEFTIST LEGAL EXPERT DERSHOWITZ Calls Out 9th Circuit For Playing Politics: Not a solid decision [Video],"Harvard Law Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz was on MSNBC to make a statement on the 9th Circuit Opinion: He stated that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals  ruling against President Trump s immigration order is  not a solid decision.  And  looks like it s based more on policy than on constitutionality. Look, this is not a solid decision. This is a decision that looks like it s based more on policy than on constitutionality. There are many, many flaws. He added,  I think this court opinion will not ultimately be sustained by the Supreme Court. Take, for example, the argument that it s an establishment of religion, because it favors Christians or other religious minorities. In 1944 we passed the War Refugee Act, which specifically was designed to rescue a hundred thousand Jews, and everybody knew the purpose was to rescue jews. That didn t establish Judaism as the state religion of the United States. I think the establishment argument will fail in the Supreme Court. I think the standing arguments may fail in the Supreme Court.  ",0.0

What price did Bill Clinton pay for destroying this young girl s life? What price did Hillary pay for enabling his behavior (that bordered on pedophilia given the age difference between Bill and Monica)? This young girl was  slut shamed  by the entire world while Bill and Hillary, unconcerned with her well-being, huddled together to work out the details of how they would deceive the world with lies and save their political careers and ambitions. Hillary even went so far as to call Monica a  narcissistic looney tune. Does anyone really believe the audience at this event had any desire to hear what Monica Lewinsky had to say about the age of media, and how it affects people s lives?

" Mike Pence Abruptly Bails On PBS Interview, Crumbles Under Russia Pressure (TWEETS)","If Donald Trump and his team are trying to pretend that everything is fine and nothing s wrong, they re not doing a very good job.Earlier today, Trump kicked off the morning by indulging in his habitual Twitter habit whenever he s nervous about something. Providing a distraction from former FBI Director James Comey s testimony, Trump decided to announce his pick for a new FBI Director   signaling that Trump is nervous as hell and desperate to take the heat off the Russia scandal. It turns out, his Vice President is also freaking out.Apparently, Mike Pence reacted to the release of Comey s opening statement by abruptly cancelling a scheduled interview   literally right before it was supposed to happen! Now, Pence is cowering and has gone into hiding. Here s what went down, according to PBS:Pence bailed with no warning whatsoever!Comey s released opening statement has clearly taken the White House by surprise, and everyone s in panic mode now. The White House has been on media lockdown since the release of the statement, and Pence s response surely raised suspicions.Pence, without a doubt, cancelled that interview so he wouldn t have to answer questions about Comey   because he could not only further incriminate Trump, but himself as well. Despite the fact that most of the focus has been on Trump, Pence is also in big trouble because of the Russia scandal. Trump s entire administration is in danger if he goes down.What happens tomorrow during Comey s testimony will likely change the entire direction of the Russia scandal, and it already looks as if it is going to mean bad news for Trump. All of the warning signs and red flags are present, and everyone close to Trump is now running for the hills. For Pence to cancel this interview certainly means something fishy is happening, and most of us can t wait to find out.Featured image via Alex Wong / Getty Images",0.0
BOOM! Its Payback Time For Gun-Grabbing Gov: GOP Works To Strip Him Of Armed Protection Detail,"Do you think our Gun Grabber In Chief should be next?Virginia state senator Bill Carrico (R-Dist. 40) is responding to Governor Terry McAuliffe s (D) relentless gun control push by introducing a budget amendment to remove funding for McAuliffe s protection detail.Carrico said,  If he s so afraid of guns, then I m not going to surround him with armed state policemen. McAuliffe has pushed numerous gun controls as governor and, in August, infamously pushed for expanding background checks after Virginia reporter Alison Parker had been shot on air. McAuliffe made the push for expanded background checks before the gunman who killed Parker had been caught and, therefore, before he had any knowledge of how the gunman acquired his gun. As it turned out, gunman Vester Lee Flanagan acquired his gun via a background check.Moreover, on October 15, McAuliffe issued an executive order banning the open carry of firearms in state buildings used by the Virginia executive branch and calling for enforcement to ensure that the only people  in the business  of selling guns in Virginia are those with a Federal Firearm License (FFL).Senator Carrico is responding to these things and more by trying to be sure McAuliffe does not have to be around guns at all if they bother him so much. According to the Bristol Herald Courier, Carrico said he will address this matter when the General Assembly convenes in January, saying:A lot of the governor s power is deferred to the General Assembly at that point and I ll be getting with my colleagues to circumvent everything this governor has done on this point. I have a budget amendment that I m looking at to take away his executive protection unit. If he s so afraid of guns, then I m not going to surround him with armed state policemen.

In 2011, the Obama administration was negotiating with the Iraqi government to give American troops immunity prosecution by Iraqis   a touchy political issue.There s debate on whether the Americans could have worked out a deal, but Pence is wrong to suggest Clinton is to blame. The key decisions and discussions took place between the White House itself and Iraqi leaders.Pence:  They want to expand (Obamacare) into a single-payer program. Clinton and Kaine have proposed a public option   a government-sponsored insurance plan   but they have not proposed single-payer. Clinton has consistently resisted going in that direction and instead proposes to work to prevent the repeal of Obamacare and try to improve on it.Pence s claim is Mostly False.Pence: Donald Trump  never said that  more nations should get nuclear weapons.Mostly False. Trump has said some countries, namely Japan and South Korea, might be  better off  if they were to develop nuclear weapons, given their proximity to North Korea. However, he has also said   often in the same interview   that he opposes nuclear proliferation in general.Pence:  We delivered $400 million in cash as a ransom payment for Americans held by the radical mullahs in Tehran.This  ransom  line, which we ve previously heard from Trump, is Mostly False. Iran received the payment on the same day that American prisoners were released, but experts said this was not ransom. The United States owed Iran the money as part of a decades-long financial dispute.Pence:  Less than 10 cents on the dollar in the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes. This is a repeated Republican talking point and it s inaccurate. While it s true that the foundation gives away in grants a small fraction of its resources, about 87 percent of its expenses go toward services it provides directly.And that s just a few. The entire analysis of the truthfulness of the vice presidential candidates  claims can be found here at Politifact.Overall, Mike Pence had to walk a very difficult tight rope Tuesday night. While he might have won when it comes to a calm, cool style, he failed miserably on substance. Perhaps that is because when it comes down to it, his running mate is a racist, misogynist, pathological liar and a dangerous demagogue who should never be anywhere near the Oval Office. To that end, Pence s strategy seemed to be to insist that the more outrageous things that Donald Trump has said throughout this horrific travesty of a presidential campaign aren t true, and to run away from clearly indefensible positions. Or maybe he s just drank the Kool-Aid they regularly serve up at Trump Tower, and actually thinks he is telling the truth and being reasonable.Either way, it s insanity. Thank goodness for fact-checkers to help set the American people straight in this nightmare of a presidential election season.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",0.0
Rights groups urge end to Poland's overhaul of judiciary,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Plans to overhaul Poland s judiciary would end the country s status as a democratic state based on the rule of law and should be scrapped, more than two dozen rights groups and non-governmental organizations said in a petition on Wednesday. The petition, backed by Amnesty International and the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights among others, came as parliament started debating amendments agreed by President Andrzej Duda and the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS). The proposals give the parliament a virtually free hand in deciding the composition of the Supreme Court and how judges are selected and are  in gross conflict  with the constitution, the signatories said in their petition.  The introduction of these amendments will mean that Poland will definitely cease to be a democratic state of law,  it said.  We request the immediate stoppage of parliamentary work on (the bills) and demand the start of extensive public consultations on this.  The nationalist, eurosceptic PiS,  which has a parliamentary majority, says reform of the judicial system is needed because the courts are slow, inefficient and steeped in a communist-era mentality.  Duda had raised hopes among critics of the plans that they could be halted when he vetoed the original PiS proposals in July, following nationwide protests and warnings from the European Union.  The president, an ally of PiS, said then that the proposals gave too much power to one party and to the justice minister. But subsequent work on the amendments has been conducted in secrecy, spurring criticism from the United Nations and the European Commission that they could further damage Poland s judicial system. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of PiS and Poland s paramount politician, has met privately with Duda several times for talks. Details of those meetings have not been made public and it is not known what consensus has been reached.  The president gave us some hope that the constitution would not be so continually abused,  said Irena Kaminska, a judge and a member of the Themis association of judges.  For a moment I had hoped there would be a breakthrough, but that has not happened.  Stanislaw Piotrowicz, head of parliament s justice committee, told the PAP state news agency that lawmakers could complete work on the bills at the next session, planned for Dec. 6-8.  If the bills pass they could potentially allow PiS to tighten its control of the political system, its critics said. Marcin Matczak of the Batory Foundation in Warsaw, one of the NGO signatories to the petition, said PiS would be able to change the electoral system to its own advantage because the judges would no longer challenge them.  After the (court) laws are implemented the government will be able to rule eternally,  he said.  There will be no one to defend us.  The EU is pressing a legal case against Poland over its judicial reform plans and has suggested the country could forfeit some development funds if it refuses to change course. PiS says it has a democratic mandate for its reforms. ",1.0
[VIDEO] GAY ACTRESS TRIES TO AMBUSH TED CRUZ AT IOWA PICNICCruz Turns The Argument Around In A Brilliant Way,"The left is quickly discovering that this is a very different crop of GOP Presidential candidates, who are not going to allow the progressive left to steamroll them as easily as they have in the past While manning a grill at the Iowa State Fair on Friday, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)was ambushed by lesbian actress Ellen Page and ended up debating homosexuality and religious freedom, unaware of who she really was.Page, dressed incognito, pressed Cruz for his thoughts on  people getting fired just for being gay or trans,  to which Cruz said he believed Christians are being persecuted in the wake of the Supreme Court s June ruling, which mandated same-sex marriage a constitutional right.Cruz reminded Page of the treatment of homosexuals by ISIS and Iran, which Page scantily acknowledged, before arguing Christians are using violence against gay people in Jamaica. Cruz then reprimanded the actress for not understanding the contrast between violent behavior and public executions.Via: Breitbart News",0.0
JUSTICE SCALIA Found Dead With Pillow Over His HeadWhy No Autopsy?,"It was just announced that there will be no autopsy of Justice Scalia after he was found dead in his room of  natural causes . Does anyone else out there think it should be mandatory for an autopsy to be performed? Since Justice Antonin Scalia was found dead in his resort hotel room at Cibolo Creek Creek Ranch on Saturday, questions have been flying about the immediate declaration of  natural causes  as the means of death.According to the ranch owner, Scalia was described as  animated and engaged  during dinner Friday night. He was one of three dozen invitees to an event unrelated to law or politics.Yet just hours later, after missing both breakfast and lunch, he was found dead of apparent natural causes. Later, media outlets reported he had suffered a heart attack.Houston businessman John Poindexter, who owns the 30,000-acre luxury ranch, recalled:  He was seated near me and I had a chance to observe him. He was very entertaining. But about 9 p.m. he said,  It s been a long day and a long week, I want to get some sleep. Poindexter knocked on Scalia s door about 8:30 the next morning. The door was locked and the judge did not answer. Three hours later, Poindexter returned from an outing and determined Scalia was still missing. We discovered the judge in bed, a pillow over his head. His bed clothes were unwrinkled,  said Poindexter. He was lying very restfully. It looked like he had not quite awakened from a nap,  he said.Scalia did not have a pulse and his body was cold, and after consulting with a doctor at a hospital in Alpine, Poindexter concluded resuscitation would have been futile. He then contacted federal authorities, at first encountering a series of answering services because he was calling on a weekend. Ultimately they became available and handled it superbly,  he said.  They flew in by helicopter. They told me to secure the ranch, which I did until this morning. Scalia s body was moved to an El Paso funeral home early Sunday, then driven from Marfa and arrived around 2:30 a.m. at Sunset Funeral Homes, according to spokesman Chris Lujan.Read more: wnd",0.0
Exclusive: Trump to weigh more aggressive U.S. strategy on Iran - sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is weighing a strategy that could allow more aggressive U.S. responses to Iran s forces, its Shi ite Muslim proxies in Iraq and Syria, and its support for militant groups, according to six current and former U.S. officials. The proposal was prepared by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, national security adviser H.R. McMaster and other top officials, and presented to Trump at a National Security Council meeting on Friday, the sources said. It could be agreed and made public before the end of September, two of the sources said. All of the sources are familiar with the draft and requested anonymity because Trump has yet to act on it. In contrast to detailed instructions handed down by President Barack Obama and some of his predecessors, Trump is expected to set broad strategic objectives and goals for U.S. policy but leave it to U.S. military commanders, diplomats and other U.S. officials to implement the plan, said a senior administration official.  Whatever we end up with, we want to implement with allies to the greatest extent possible,  the official added. The White House declined to comment. The plan is intended to increase the pressure on Tehran to curb its ballistic missile programs and support for militants, several sources said.  I would call it a broad strategy for the range of Iranian malign activities: financial materials, support for terror, destabilization in the region, especially Syria and Iraq and Yemen,  said another senior administration official.    The proposal also targets cyber espionage and other activity and potentially nuclear proliferation, the official said. The administration is still debating a new stance on a 2015 agreement, sealed by Obama, to curb Iran s nuclear weapons program. The draft urges consideration of tougher economic sanctions if Iran violates the 2015 agreement. The proposal includes more aggressive U.S. interceptions of Iranian arms shipments such as those to Houthi rebels in Yemen and Palestinian groups in Gaza and Egypt s Sinai, a current official and a knowledgeable former U.S. official said. The plan also recommends the United States react more aggressively in Bahrain, whose Sunni Muslim monarchy has been suppressing majority Shi ites, who are demanding reforms, the sources said. In addition, U.S. naval forces could react more forcefully when harassed by armed speed boats operated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran s paramilitary and espionage contingent, three of the sources said. U.S. ships have fired flares and warning shots to drive off IRGC boats that made what were viewed as threatening approaches after refusing to heed radio warnings in the passageway for 35 percent of the world s seaborne petroleum exports. U.S. commanders now are permitted to open fire only when they think their vessels and the lives of their crews are endangered. The sources offered no details of the proposed changes in the rules, which are classified. The plan does not include an escalation of U.S. military activity in Syria and Iraq. Trump s national security aides argued that a more muscular military response to Iranian proxies in Syria and Iraq would complicate the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State, which they argued should remain the top priority, four of the sources said. Mattis and McMaster, as well as the heads of the U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Forces Command, have opposed allowing U.S. commanders in Syria and Iraq to react more forcefully to provocations by the IRGC, Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed Shi ite militias, the four sources said. The advisers are concerned that more permissive rules of engagement would divert U.S. forces from defeating the remnants of Islamic State, they said. Moreover, looser rules could embroil the United States in a conflict with Iran while U.S. forces remain overstretched, and Trump has authorized a small troop increase for Afghanistan, said one senior administration official. A former U.S. official said Hezbollah and Iranian-backed Shi ite militias in Iraq have been  very helpful  in recapturing vast swaths of the caliphate that Islamic State declared in Syria and Iran in 2014. U.S. troops supporting Kurdish and Sunni Arab fighters battling Islamic State in Syria have been wrestling with how to respond to hostile actions by Iranian-backed forces. In some of the most notable cases, U.S. aircraft shot down two Iranian-made drones in June. Both were justified as defensive acts narrowly tailored to halt an imminent threat on the ground. Trump s opposition to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), poses a dilemma for policymakers. Most of his national security aides favor remaining in the pact, as do U.S. allies Israel and Saudi Arabia despite their reservations about Iran s adherence to the agreement, said U.S. officials involved in the discussions.  The main issue for us was to get the president not to discard the JCPOA. But he had very strong feelings, backed by (U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations) Nikki Haley, that they should be more aggressive with Iran,  one of the two U.S. officials said.  Almost all the strategies presented to him were ones that tried to preserve the JCPOA but lean forward on these other (issues.)  ",1.0
Lebanon's Hariri leaves Saudi Arabia for France on Friday,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Saad al-Hariri, who sparked a crisis by resigning as Lebanese prime minister on Nov. 4 during a visit to Saudi Arabia, is on his way to the airport, he said early on Saturday, before his flight from Riyadh to France.  Hariri s abrupt resignation while he was in Saudi Arabia and his continued stay there caused fears over Lebanon s stability. His visit to France with his family to meet President Emmanuel Macron is seen as part of a possible way out of the crisis.   I am on the way to the airport,  he said in a Tweet.  However, Okab Saqr, a member of parliament for Hariri s Future Movement, said that after Hariri s visit to France, he would have  a small Arab tour  before traveling to Beirut. Macron, speaking in Sweden, said Hariri  intends to return to his country in the coming days, weeks . The crisis has thrust Lebanon into the bitter rivalry pitting Saudi Arabia and its allies against a bloc led by Iran, which includes the heavily armed Lebanese Shi ite Hezbollah group.  In Lebanon, Hariri has long been an ally of Riyadh. His coalition government, formed in a political deal last year to end years of paralysis, includes Hezbollah.  President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, has called Hariri a Saudi hostage and refused to accept his resignation unless he returns to Lebanon. Saudi Arabia and Hariri say his movements are not restricted. On Wednesday, Macron invited Hariri to visit France along with his family, providing what French diplomats said might be a way to reduce tensions surrounding the crisis by demonstrating that Hariri could leave Saudi Arabia. Lebanese politicians from across the political spectrum have called for Hariri to return to the country, saying it is necessary to resolve the crisis.  Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, who heads President Aoun s political party, said on Thursday Beirut could escalate the crisis if Hariri did not return home.  We have adopted self-restraint so far to arrive at this result so that we don t head towards diplomatic escalation and the other measures available to us,  he said during a European tour aimed at building pressure for a solution to the crisis. Saudi Arabia regards Hezbollah as a conduit for Iranian interference across the Middle East, particularly in Syria, Yemen and Bahrain. It says it has no problem with Hezbollah remaining a purely political party, but has demanded it surrender its arms, which the group says are needed to defend Lebanon.  Although Riyadh has said it accepted Hariri s decision to join a coalition with Hezbollah last year, after Hariri announced his resignation Saudi Arabia accused Lebanon of declaring war on it because of Hezbollah s regional role. Lebanon, where Sunni, Shi ite, Christian and Druze groups fought a 1975-1990 civil war, maintains a governing system intended to balance sectarian groups. The prime minister is traditionally from the Sunni community, of which Hariri is the most influential leader. On Friday, Hariri said in a tweet that his presence in Saudi Arabia was for  consultations on the future of the situation in Lebanon and its relations with the surrounding Arab region .  His scheduled meeting with Macron in Paris on Saturday, and a lunch that his family will also attend, comes the day before Arab foreign ministers meet in Cairo to discuss Iran.  Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Centre in Beirut, says it appears Saudi Arabia hopes the ministers will adopt a  strongly worded statement  against Iran. But she said not all the countries share Riyadh s view that one way to confront Iran is to apply pressure on Lebanon.  There is quite a widespread understanding that there is only so much Lebanon can do and it doesn t serve anybody to turn Lebanon into your next arena for a fight between Iran and Saudi Arabia,  said.

Venezuela opposition leader Ledezma flees to Spain,"CARACAS/BOGOTA (Reuters) - Veteran Venezuelan opposition leader Antonio Ledezma, under house arrest since 2015 for alleged coup plotting, escaped across the border to Colombia on Friday and later flew to Spain. With a 2018 presidential election looming, an array of major Venezuelan opposition figures are now in exile, detention or are barred from holding office. They say Maduro has turned Venezuela into a dictatorship, while the government accuses them of joining forces with a U.S.-led global plot to topple him. Ledezma, the best-known detained opponent of leftist President Nicolas Maduro after Leopoldo Lopez, had spearheaded street protests against Maduro in 2014 that led to months of violence and 43 deaths.  In Spain today I feel free,  he said at Madrid s Barajas airport, where he arrived in the early hours of Saturday. He was cheered by a small crowd including his wife and two daughters, who were already in Spain. Supporters chanted the Venezuelan anthem.  Let s not permit that Venezuela dies in our hands,  he also said, adding that he would soon meet with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. The 62-year-old former Caracas metropolitan mayor said he had gone past 29 police and army controls during a clandestine, overland journey that he kept secret from his loved ones.  I ask my wife and daughters to understand. They have suffered long hours of anguish without knowing where I was,  he told reporters in the Colombian border town of Cucuta after crossing a bridge from San Antonio in Venezuela.  It was my decision alone.    Welcome to freedom!  tweeted former Colombian President Andres Pastrana, who is close to Venezuela s opposition and the families of other jailed activists. Ledezma was mocked by Maduro as  The Vampire,  and accused by officials of helping violent hardliners, including dissident military officers plotting to topple the president via air strikes. Ledezma said those charges were trumped up.  I hope they never send him back, they can keep the Vampire,  Maduro said on Friday evening.  The people of Madrid will have to be careful at night, the Vampire (is going) to Madrid.  Before boarding a private plane to Bogota, Ledezma said he was planning a  global pilgrimage  to fight for political freedom in Venezuela. He thanked Colombia s government, which also recently gave asylum to another high-profile Venezuelan dissident, former state prosecutor Luisa Ortega.  It s time for him (Maduro) to step aside and allow a transition government,  said Ledezma.  Maduro cannot keep torturing the Venezuelan people, he s killing Venezuelans with hunger.  The OPEC nation of 30 million people is suffering a fourth year of brutal recession, with the highest inflation in the world, shortages of food and medicines, and many people having to skip meals or suffering preventable illnesses. Government supporters have long vilified Ledezma for supporting a brief 2002 coup and accused him of corruption. State media repeatedly show a video where a jailed student radical lauds him as  an old fox ... the politician who most supported the resistance.  Ledezma, along with another opposition leader, Maria Corina Machado, has been part of the more militant wing of Venezuela s opposition coalition. Both oppose a planned new political dialogue between the opposition and government scheduled for early December in the Dominican Republic.  I left my flag with Maria Corina Machado, in whom I trust completely,  Ledezma told reporters. Ledezma won the Caracas mayoralty in 2008, but some of his functions and funding were quickly transferred to a new, pro-government office. Upstaged by younger opposition leaders, Ledezma was not viewed as a future presidential candidate. Intelligence agents took him from his office in Caracas in February 2015. He was originally held at the Ramo Verde military prison before being granted house arrest.   Machado told reporters Ledezma had been under increasing pressure from authorities and had faced threats to return him to Ramo Verde due to his opposition to the political dialogue.  We believe in real negotiations, but only ones that lead to the exit of the dictatorship,  she told reporters. ",1.0
Democrat And Media Allies Attempts To Crush Black GOP Candidate Backfire: Carson Beating Trump In Every National Poll,"The more they hammer the GOP frontrunners, the more popular they become with the American voter. Is the real revolution taking place with the American people against the misleading, reckless and agenda driven media? After more than a hundred days of leading in every national poll, a New York Times/CBS poll released Tuesday shows Dr. Ben Carson edging into a 26% to 22% national lead over Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. The margin of error is a high 6%. But in this same poll, the trend shows that Trump has lost -5 points, while Carson gained +5 points.According to the Real Clear Politics poll of poll, Trump currently enjoys a +5 point national lead over Carson.Every other candidate is trailing by -14 or more points. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) is in third with 8%; Jeb Bush and Carly Fiorina are tied at 7%. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Mike Huckabee, and John Kasich are all tied up at 4%.If you include Cruz, the non-establishment candidates earn 59% of support from Republican primary supporters.There is some good news for Trump: his support is firmer than Carson s. a full 55% of Trump supporters said he is their guy to the bitter end, compared to just 20% for Carson.Carson s national surge (at least in this poll) into first place coincides with what can only be described as a commanding lead in Iowa. According to the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, Carson beats Trump by 9% in the all-important caucus state.Trump enjoys a commanding lead in every other state.To those of us living out here in the real world, Carson s rise is only a surprise to the DC Media. Earlier this month, Carson had a phenomenal week as the DC Media ganged up to destroy Carson over things he said that were not at all controversial. Carson suggested students practice self-defense if faced with a mass-shooter and that Nazi-era Jews would have been in a better position to resist more had the government not confiscated their firearms in advance of the Holocaust.Democrats and their media allies have a long history of punishing black people who do not think the way they believe black people should think. Only today, instead of using the KKK, German Shepherds, and firehoses, the media uses Narratives and name-calling ( crazy,   stupid ) to  other  free-thinking black men who dare stray from the Left-Wing Thought Plantation. That s why people don t trust you (the press) anymore.  Ben Carson brilliantly hands the press their hat in this clip:https://youtu.be/GJcYnEhc0x8In the face of his racist DC Media oppressors, Carson, who has struggled in the past during media appearances, was nothing short of phenomenal. The good doctor kept his cool, his poise, and brilliantly made his case. It was the best week of his campaign, and what voters saw was a man fully capable of handling a hostile media.Also, voters are likely responding to the fact that, at least for now, Carson gives the GOP their best chance to defeat Hillary. He s up +5 points over her in the Real Clear poll of polls. Trump loses by -2.5 points.Via: Breitbart News",0.0
Judges find two North Carolina congressional districts racially gerrymandered,"(Reuters) - Two of North Carolinas congressional districts were racially gerrymandered in a 2011 redistricting and must be redrawn within two weeks, a U.S. appeals court panel ruled on Friday. The order written by Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Roger Gregory bars elections in the majority black districts, the 1st and the 12th, until the new maps are approved. North Carolina congressional primaries are scheduled for March 15 This Court finds that Congressional Districts 1 and 12 as drawn in the 2011 Congressional Redistricting Plan are unconstitutional, Gregory wrote. The ruling said race had been the main factor when the Republican-controlled legislature redrew the boundaries and state lawmakers were not justified in using that benchmark. Three voters filed suit in 2013 to invalidate the districts. Both are represented by Democrats, with G.K. Butterfield in the 1st, and Alma Adams in the 12th. State Senator Bob Rucho and House member David Lewis, who guided the redistricting plan through the legislature, were quoted on the Raleigh News and Observer website as saying they would appeal the ruling by the three-judge panel.

Ultra-Orthodox protesters arrested in violent clash in Jerusalem,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Jewish ultra-Orthodox demonstrators protesting the arrest of a prospective army conscript from their community clashed with police in Jerusalem on Sunday and eight men were detained, police said. Police used a water canon and mounted officers dispersed the protest that briefly turned violent near Jerusalem s military recruiting office which lies on the edge of one of the city s ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods. Although most ultra-Orthodox seminary students gain exemption from military service on religious grounds, they must obtain their exemption through a conscription procedure. Police said the protest was prompted by the man s arrest after he refused to turn up for recruitment. Last week Israel s Supreme Court ruled that parts of the conscription law that exempt seminary students were unconstitutional and gave the government a year to resolve the matter. Most Jewish Israelis, men and women, are called up for military service when they turn 18. Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said protesters blocked streets and threw stones at police officers. Video footage showed officers kicking, punching and pushing some demonstrators and a few were dragged across a street. ",1.0
 This Touching Moment POTUS Shared With A Hiroshima Survivor Is Why Hell Be So Sorely Missed (VIDEO),"President Obama s trip to Hiroshima would come and go without an official apology to the Japanese people for dropping hellfire on them to end World War II. The official position of the U.S. government is that the bombings were a necessary evil to end a war with no end in sight, ultimately saving lives and bringing the world back to peace. Just because the President wasn t in a position to apologize doesn t mean that he couldn t be the man we all know and have come to expect him to be.While the president s speech was eloquent, reminding us that the people of Hiroshima were just like you and I, it was a moment he shared with a man who survived the bombing that is catching the attention of the world. In this video by ABC News, you can see President Obama intently listening to the man s story through a translator. At one point the man begins to break down and our President, obviously working off of pure decency and instinct, put his arm around the man and gave him a hug.The Japanese are a proud people who prefer the bow and the handshake, but the elderly gentleman who had been to hell and back seemed grateful that the President of the United States would show him such compassion:Conservatives, who have been demonizing the president s plans to visit the site for weeks now are out in force, condemning the action as an apology rather than a human being connecting with another human being in a display of true compassion, something their shallow, selfish minds can t quite reconcile with.

No matter how outrageous his words or deeds,  Therefore, it comes as no surprise that during an appearance on ABC s This Week, Matt Schlapp, Chairman of the American Conservative Union actually suggested that Trump s chaotic excuse for governing the nation is actually helping move the GOP legislative agenda alone.First, former conservative radio host and #NeverTrump Republican Charlie Sykes was able to weigh in, saying: The role that the president is playing, rather than showing leadership of any kind, he is sowing chaos, confusion and destruction. Schlapp said in response: I get the fact that there s an opinion on Donald Trump that a lot of people don t like Donald Trump. The president does want to get it done but he wants to get it done within the context of the other aspects of these polices. So Dreamers are going to have to be accompanied with border security. And [Obamacare] CSR payments are going to have to be accompanied by other health care reforms. That s where the very outspoken Van Jones chimed in: You just described probably the most complicated set of negotiations in the history of the republic, that this guy is ramming through. Schlapp tried to cut Jones off, but Jones wasn t having it, and plowed on: I m not finished yet, I m not done. The problem you are having is what you are describing is something that would require real leadership, real finesse. On BOTH sides!  Schlapp desperately pouted.Jones calmly continued: I ll say on both sides. But your guy, who you are going to love and defend   I understand it s your job   you have to admit he s his own worst enemy. In order to do what you just described, you would need discipline and focus. That s when Jones really let the bomb drop: That this isn t normal, and Senator Bob Corker started openly questioning Trump s stability and fitness to serve. Jones said: We are so into the crazy now, when something significant happens, we don t notice. [Corker] is not a bomb thrower. And when someone of his stature and his temperament says World War III, that should be a all-cars-stop-on-the-interstate moment. What is going on? Van Jones is correct. This is a very dangerous situation, and Trump s cable news lackeys are enabling this playing of Russian Roulette with our lives and the future of the nation. If we land in a nuclear war, you know who to blame   it s the Matt Schlapp s of the world, not the Van Joneses.Watch the incredible conversation below.",0.0
Factbox: Who will Trump pick to lead the Federal Reserve?,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has interviewed several top prospects for the post of Chair of the Federal Reserve. A nomination could come within weeks as the term of current Chair Janet Yellen ends in February 2018. Yellen will meet with Trump about the job on Thursday. (For a graphic on the next chair of the Federal Reserve, click tmsnrt.rs/2yqJh2I) He faces a choice between two continuity candidates, Yellen and Governor Jerome Powell, and a clutch of outsiders, including Gary Cohn, currently his top economic advisor, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and Stanford University economics professor John Taylor. Here are short profiles of the candidates: Gary Cohn, 57, Director of the National Economic Council Experience: Longtime Goldman Sachs employee and president and chief operating officer of the Wall Street bank from 2006 to 2017. Education: Bachelors degree in business, American University Policy positions: Cohns current job as director of the NEC has given him little reason to comment on monetary policy, but  he has worried in the past that the Fed has been constrained by the actions of other central banks trying to keep their currencies weak. In his own words: If we woke up tomorrow and every central bank in the world raised their interest rates by (3 percent), the world would be a much better place. Pros to candidacy:   A practitioners understanding of financial markets at a time the Fed is attempting to unwind its bond portfolio bought after the 2008 financial crisis  The trust of the White House and many congressional Republicans given Cohns high-profile role in the Trump administration Cons to candidacy:   No formal economics background at a time when the Fed leans ever more on econometric models to decipher mixed signals in inflation and employment data  A decades-long career at Goldman Sachs and a personal fortune worth at least $260 million, which could raise eyebrows when it comes to confirmation by the Senate, where members on both sides see the investment bank as a symbol of financial industry excess  Criticism of Trump in the wake of Charlottesville, Virginia, protests Jerome Powell, 64, Federal Reserve Governor Experience: Lawyer and investment banker; partner in private equity firm Carlyle Group from 1997-2005; Senior Treasury official under George H.W. Bush; Fed Governor since 2012 (appointed by President Obama) Education: Bachelors degree in politics, Princeton University; Law degree from Georgetown University Policy positions: Powell has never dissented while at the Fed, and in line with Yellen supports slowly raising interest rates as long as the economy continues growing and inflation is expected to rise. He advocates easing some aspects of the Dodd-Frank regulations and has discussed ways to revise the Volcker Rule. In his own words: The Committee has been patient in raising rates, and that patience has paid dividends ... I would view it as appropriate to continue to gradually raise rates. Pros to candidacy:   An uncontroversial pick for the position, could be the compromise who both replaces Yellen and provides continuity  Only Republican currently on the Board of Governors, has already helped guide the economy in its recovery and would likely get bipartisan support in Congress   Familiarity with markets and financial regulation may be considered a plus Cons to candidacy:   As a current Fed member identified with the more centrist wing of the Republican Party, may not provide enough of a change if Trump decides to replace Yellen   Expertise is less in formal economics and more in markets and financial regulation, which may seem too much of an overlap with the new vice chair for supervision, Randal Quarles John Taylor, 70, Senior fellow at Stanford Universitys Hoover Institution Experience: Undersecretary of Treasury for international affairs in the George W. Bush administration from 2001 to 2005; member of Council of Economic Advisers under presidents Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush Education: PhD in economics, Stanford University Policy positions: Developer of the eponymous Taylor Rule for setting interest rates, Taylor feels the Fed should transition to a rules-based policy in order to make its decision-making predictable-transparent-accountable. In his own words: It is very important to have a basic understanding of the monetary policy strategy. The FOMC should be required to adopt and explain its monetary strategy, and then compare that strategy with monetary policy rules that are out there in a transparent way. Pros to candidacy:   A trained economist whose elegantly simple research in the 1990s transformed the debate over how central banks set rates  Support among key Capitol Hill Republicans who feel the Fed has too much discretion  Well known in central banking circles, even if his ideas are not universally supported Cons to candidacy:  A long-term member of the central banking and academic cliques Trump may want to disrupt  Advocacy of rule-based policy may land with a thud in an institution that thrives on consensus and judgment  Break with Yellen and current policy framework could disrupt markets if Taylor insists on broad reform Kevin Warsh, 47, Visiting Fellow at Stanford Universitys Hoover Institution Experience: Fed governor from 2006 to 2011; economic adviser to President George W. Bush from 2002 to 2006; M&A lawyer at Morgan Stanley for seven years Education: Bachelors degree in public policy, Stanford University; Law degree from Harvard University Policy positions: Warsh feels the Fed should not try to fine-tune the economy and argues policymakers have too much discretion. He feels the Fed should aim for inflation between 1 and 2 percent, effectively lowering its inflation target. In his own words: We should not accept the Feds newfound conviction that a very low neutral equilibrium real short-term interest rate (r*) is a fixed feature of future monetary policy ... The central bank and the academic community should engage in a fundamental rethinking of the Feds strategy, tools, governance, and communications. Pros to candidacy:   Former banker and for several years former Fed Chair Ben Bernankes right-hand man on financial markets, has a familiarity with Wall Street   Wife Jane Lauder Warsh is a daughter of cosmetics magnate Ron Lauder, a longtime friend of Trump  Served on the presidents economic advisory council before it disbanded Cons to candidacy:   May be seen as too hawkish by a president who calls himself a low interest rate person   Not an academic economist like Yellen or Bernanke but has still maintained U.S. monetary policy needs a full makeover   Worried about inflation even as the 2008 financial crisis hit, and quit the Fed over its second round of bond-buying, a possible black mark against his judgment given the success of the quantitative easing program  Even while quitting over Fed bond buying, never dissented on FOMC decisions Janet Yellen, 71, Federal Reserve Chair Experience: Also served as a Fed governor, President of the San Francisco Fed, and the Feds vice chair from 2010 to 2014  Education: PhD in economics, Yale University Policy positions: Yellen steered the Fed towards gradual rate increases and a slow reduction of its balance sheet, dependent on evidence of a continued economic recovery. She argues that post-crisis financial regulation has made the economy more stable without sacrificing growth. In her own words: My colleagues and I may have misjudged the strength of the labor market ... or even the fundamental forces driving inflation ... How should policy be formulated in the face of such significant uncertainties? In my view, it strengthens the case for a gradual pace of adjustments. Pros to candidacy:   After a career in the Fed system and four years as its head, has earned the trust of markets and shown she can shift policy without major disruption   A growing economy, low unemployment, and strong stock markets make the case for continuity, while Trump has said publicly he feels she is doing a good job Cons to candidacy:   Could be seen as a Democratic holdover by a President who may want to put his own stamp on the Fed   Feels the core regulations approved after the financial crisis should remain intact, a possible friction with the administrations deregulatory bent   Some Republican leaders want the Fed to have less discretion over monetary policy, an idea Yellen resists ",1.0
Battle over bathrooms looms large in North Carolina governor's race,"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - In a year of police shooting protests, historic hurricane flooding and voting rights clashes in North Carolina, it is the battle over bathrooms that could prove pivotal in the Tar Heel states gubernatorial race. The election will effectively serve as a referendum on a state law that bans transgender people from using government-run restrooms that match their gender identity and limits protections for gays and lesbians. Signed by Republican Governor Pat McCrory in March, the law has been blamed for hundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses and the relocation of major sporting events from the ninth largest U.S. state. Opponents of the law say the vote on Tuesday also could have national implications. If McCrory loses to Democratic challenger Roy Cooper, they said, elected officials backing such measures in other states will face greater political risk.  I believe a strong message already has been sent to lawmakers across the country, said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, the nations largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) civil rights organization. I believe and hope on Election Day that an even stronger message will be sent. The advocacy group has joined with Equality North Carolina for a broad effort to boost voter turnout and unseat McCrory and other supporters of the law known as House Bill 2. The organizations are targeting about 400,000 pro-equality voters in the state, including an estimated 255,800 LGBT voters, Griffin said. The Human Rights Campaign said that voting bloc could make a difference in a presidential swing state where Democrat Barack Obama won by about 14,000 votes in 2008 and Republican Mitt Romney led by about 92,000 votes in 2012. Theres no question this is going to be a very close race at the top of the ticket, and the LGBTQ voting bloc really has the ability to impact the outcome of this election, said Chris Sgro, executive director of Equality North Carolina. RACE A TOSS-UP Elections experts consider the race between McCrory and Cooper, one of 12 U.S. gubernatorial seats being decided on Tuesday, to be among the countrys most competitive.  Public opinion polls have been tight most of the year, though the RealClearPolitics average of recent surveys shows Cooper with a slight advantage. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll found that, among residents who expect to vote, 38 percent were less likely to support McCrorys re-election bid as a result of the law and its fallout, compared with 32 percent who were more likely to support him. The poll was conducted online in English between Oct. 6 and Oct. 19. It included 1,233 likely voters and had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points. Other polls have shown a majority of residents believe the law is hurting the state. McCrory, who in 2012 became North Carolinas first Republican governor in two decades, has blamed the backlash against the law on national groups trying to redefine gender and basic norms of privacy. Cooper says the law is discriminatory, and he has made McCrorys support for it a central issue of his campaign. An ad campaign launched last week by the conservative NC Values Coalition accuses Cooper, the states attorney general since 2001, of putting women and children at risk by refusing to defend H.B. 2. By not defending it, hes allowing men into womens bathrooms, the groups executive director, Tami Fitzgerald, said in a phone interview. We think that just goes too far. Equality NC and HRC have made North Carolina ground zero for their radical LGBT agenda, she added. But I believe that their efforts will fail. At early voting sites in North Carolina this week, the issue appeared to be galvanizing people on both sides. I admire McCrory for standing behind H.B. 2, said Republican Parker Umstead, 81, a certified public accountant who cast a ballot in Winston-Salem for the incumbent. It takes courage to stand up for your beliefs. But Holly Carpenter, a 41-year-old Republican from Cary who works in the medical field, cited the measure as the prime reason why she voted against McCrory, whom she supported in 2012. To lose so many economic opportunities over that was just a huge negative for me, she said. ",1.0
Trump dismisses Buffett's rebuke over his business judgment,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Tuesday brushed off billionaire investor Warren Buffetts blistering critique of his business acumen. I dont care much about Warren Buffett, Trump said on the FOX Business television network Tuesday morning, a day after Buffett lashed out at Trump in a speech at a campaign rally for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Buffett, a widely followed investor who is chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, scorned Trumps 1995 move to list Trump hotels and casino resorts on the New York Stock Exchange, saying it lost money for the next decade and that a monkey would have outperformed Trumps company. He also challenged Trump to release his tax returns, something the real estate mogul and television star has declined to do so far citing an Internal Revenue Service audit. Trump, who has held up his career in business as a qualification to lead the country, defended his record running his hotel and casino business in Atlantic City, New Jersey. I had great timing. I got out, after seven years, he told FOX Business on Tuesday. I took a lot of money out of Atlantic City, which is what Im supposed to do. Im a businessperson.  Trump said he did well in the good times in Atlantic City, but then times started going very bad.  Trump said he used to invest in U.S. stocks but got out because I dont like what Im seeing at all, pointing to U.S. immigration policies, Syrian refugees and what he said were artificially low interest rates. He also vowed to spend twice as much on U.S. infrastructure as Clinton, who has pledged $275 billion on rebuilding the nations crumbling roads and bridges, among other structures. Trump, who has been criticized by fellow Republicans and others for responding too readily to opponents, declined to target Buffett personally for his comments: Theres no counter-punch.  Buffett on Monday vowed to do whatever it takes to get out the vote in his congressional district in Nebraska, including driving voters himself to the polls to cast ballots.  With Clinton by his side, Buffett told the crowd that his final straw was Trumps critical response to the Muslim parents of a decorated U.S. soldier killed by a bomb in Iraq 12 years ago.  Buffett is No. 3 on Forbes magazines list of the richest billionaires, with a net worth calculated at $60.8 billion. ",1.0
"Trump may have stopped the bleeding, but not the worrying"," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump may have done just enough in Sundays presidential debate to keep his leaky presidential campaign afloat - and that may have put Republicans considering abandoning him in an even tougher position.  Had Trump imploded, the flow of lawmakers and party luminaries who deserted him at the weekend over lewd comments he made about women on a videotape likely would have become a torrent, increasing demands for him to drop out of the race.  But that didnt happen. Now, Republicans who have seen their party torn apart by Trumps candidacy are once again faced with a familiar dilemma: Publicly abandon a badly wounded candidate who is endangering closely contested congressional races or stand behind him in the dimming hope that he can still win them the White House.  The Manhattan real-estate mogul delivered a feistier and more disciplined performance than at the first debate, hammering his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton on her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, and again raising decades-old accusations of sexual misconduct against her husband Bill Clinton.  That likely endeared him to the rowdy supporters who have packed arenas across the country for more than a year while perhaps doing little to reel in the more moderate voters in swing states that his campaign will need to defeat Clinton in the Nov. 8 election.  His no-holds barred approach to Hillary tonight is what conservatives have wanted to see out of a candidate since Bill Clinton was in office, said Craig Robinson, former political director of the Iowa Republican Party. The Republican base and talk radio will love this performance.  But the party is still hitched to a deeply flawed candidate who has especially struggled with women, college-educated, and suburban voters. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed close to 20 percent of Americans were still undecided on which candidate to support. Sixty percent of those were women.  A poll taken by CNN immediately following the debate showed Republicans have reason to be anxious. Viewers said Clinton had beaten Trump in the encounter, 57 percent to 34 percent.  The furor over the 2005 videotape, in which Trump bragged about groping and trying to seduce women, led dozens of lawmakers to denounce him, including Arizona Senator John McCain. Their condemnation plunged the party into its worst crisis since the resignation of President Richard Nixon, a Republican, in 1974.  The House Republican Conference, a body comprised of the almost 250 Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives, was set to meet on Monday to discuss the foundering Trump campaign, a House leadership aide said. House Speaker Paul Ryan pointedly disinvited Trump for a joint appearance in Wisconsin that had been scheduled for Saturday following publication of the tape.  All but six of the 40 Republican officeholders whose races are considered competitive in the election have condemned Trumps comments in the video, although only three members of that group have called for him to drop out.  Since the release of the video, the partys governing body, the Republican National Committee, has offered no guidance to local party officials on how to handle questions about it.  There hasnt been one email or one phone call or anything as to what the guidance is from the RNC going forward, said an RNC official who asked to remain unidentified.  The tape intensified talk in Republican circles about diverting funds from Trump to prop up House and Senate candidates who might find themselves in newfound jeopardy because of the backlash.  Its well past time to cut all ties with Trump and focus on preserving the Republican Congress and down ballot offices. Immediately, said John Weaver, a veteran Republican strategist.  Republican officials have another worry: that Trumps unpopularity may lead many Republican voters to stay at home on Election Day.  Against this backdrop of panic and condemnation, Trump on Sunday sought to rally the partys base with a fresh barrage of provocative attacks on Clinton that will give the media something other than the tape to talk about.  He offered a blistering critique of her handling of foreign policy while the countrys chief diplomat and brought his rally cry for her to be jailed to the debate stage. He also carried out a threat to make an issue of her husbands sexual history.  In doing so, Trump may have stopped the bleeding, but he did nothing to stop the worrying.  ",1.0
Indonesia prepares to divert Bali-bound flights in case of volcanic eruption,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian authorities are preparing to divert flights to 10 airports across the country in case an increasingly active volcano on the holiday island of Bali erupts and disrupts travel. Officials have warned that Mount Agung in eastern Bali could erupt at any time, prompting several countries including Australia and Singapore to issue travel advisor for one of the world s most popular tourist destinations.  Ten airports will serve as alternatives for flights bound for Bali s Ngurah Rai airport in case it is closed because of volcanic ash,  Transportation Minister Budi Karya said in a statement on Wednesday. Authorities are also preparing ferries to help people leave Bali in case air travel is disrupted, Karya said.  Airports in Jakarta, Surabaya, and Lombok are among those being prepared to allow diverted flights to land.  Bali s Ngurah Rai International Airport is the second-busiest in the country, after Jakarta s main international airport. It was operating normally on Wednesday. Nearly five million people visited Bali last year - most of them from Australia, China and Japan.     Over 75,000 residents have been evacuated from near the volcano and fears of an imminent eruption have prompted some travelers to rethink holiday plans. Several airlines in Singapore and Australia said they are preparing for disruptions, but that flights were running normally for now. Virgin Australia, which flies to Bali from Australia, said on Wednesday that it was expecting  some delays .  At present, there is no visible ash cloud and therefore flights are planned to operate as scheduled. However there may be some delays due to the fact that some of our Bali bound flights will be making fuel stops in Darwin as a precautionary measure,  the company said in a statement. Mount Agung s status was raised to the highest level last week and authorities have imposed a 12km exclusion zone around it. A 4.3 magnitude quake shook the area on Wednesday, indicating that seismic activity remains high, officials said.  The total number of tremors has decreased, but if we compare the strength (of tremors) it is definitely increasing,  said Gede Suantika, an official at national vulcanology agency.      The volcano last erupted in 1963, killing over 1,000 people. ",1.0
